That providing buprenorphine treatment is particularly onerous and time consuming for primary care physicians (PCPs),
That physicians should just reduce opioid prescriptions to address the overdose epidemic
Most outpatient buprenorphine treatment is already provided by PCPs, and expanding the availability of office-based buprenorphine treatment, as several other countries have done, presents a realistic solution to addressing the overdose crisis, the authors note.",131599
