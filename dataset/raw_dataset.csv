"The leaders of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia gather in Thessaloniki, northern Greece, on Wednesday for the fourth Quadrilateral Summit.
The prospects of the Western Balkans joining the European Union and other regional issues are expected to top the agenda, after the EU decided last month to start accession talks with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Albania.
Prime ministers Alexis Tsipras of Greece, Boyko Borissov of Bulgaria, and Viorica Dancila of Romania, and Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, will also be discussing closer cooperation in energy, transport, infrastructure and security.
The refugee crisis is also expected to be a topic of discussion following last week’s EU summit on the issue.
The Thessaloniki meeting is seen as an effort to coordinate the four countries’ positions on a number of key issues ahead of a meeting of the leaders of China and the countries of Eastern Europe and the Balkans in Sofia on Saturday and the Western Balkans Summit of the Berlin Process, which will be held in London next week.
It is the fourth such meeting between the leaders of the four countries and is expected to become a fixture on their diplomatic agendas in light of major recent developments in the region, particularly the name deal between Greece and FYROM, and the EU-Western Balkans Summit that was held in Varna in Bulgaria in May.
The meeting is also expected to help push a number of major infrastructure projects in the region, including the construction of the Gas Interconnector Greece - Bulgaria (IGB) pipeline.
The summit will begin at 6 p.m. with a meeting of the four leaders and a separate meeting of the respective infrastructure and transport ministers.
At 7 p.m., the meeting will include the delegations, and will be followed by a working dinner and a joint press conference at 8.15 p.m.",www.ekathimerini.com,2018-07-25 00:00:00,9,421969

We gave it a C+
What are The Purge movies supposed to be? Are they horror movies, in which we’re given a ludicrous set-up (all crime is legal! Mayhem reigns!) so we can enjoy ideally no more than 90 minutes of gore and anarchy? Or are these movies social commentary — an attempt, a la Blumhouse’s most critically successful venture to date, Get Out, to illuminate cultural truths through the shared nonverbal language of jump-scares and goosebumps? In the Purge franchise’s own mind, one suspects these movies are both. Unfortunately, The First Purge succeeds at accomplishing neither.
In The First Purge (a movie whose title already sets up a miserable Abbott and Costello routine, for it’s the fourth film in the franchise), the United States government — run by a new neo-fascist political party — decides to implement an experiment on Staten Island: for 12 hours, all crime will be legal. Citizens will be paid $5,000 if they decide to participate in the experiment by remaining on the island, and those participants will be fit with neon-glowing camera contact lenses so their violent debauchery can be broadcast to the public. The logic here is shaky at best (yes, I know, I know, I did just write the word “logic” in a review of The First Purge) because the goal seems to be to broadcast as much gory violence as possible to a still-free press — these fascists work slow, it turns out — but wouldn’t that turn off the vast majority of the public? If this is the First Purge, and it’s not yet something the modern-day populace is acclimated to, one imagines mass-broadcasted footage of a drug addict slashing a stranger with a fist of hypodermic needles (the first “purge” of the night) would cause most rational-minded people to recoil and think, “hmm, perhaps this isn’t the best embodiment of our nation.”
The experiment, as it’s called, was engineered by a miserable-looking Marisa Tomei in a terrible blonde wig, dressed as if she’s planning on attending an uptown art gallery opening when all of this murdering is over. We’re made to believe this character is a true believer in the moral righteousness of the Purge, a woman who’s sense of right and wrong permits encouraging free-wheeling killing but who draws the line at the government fudging the numbers to make the trial look better. (Equally incorrect casting: the monotone, middle-aged accountant-looking guy who was apparently elected president. Aren’t fascists supposed to be charismatic?)
For the first two-thirds or so of the movie, the scares are lacking. As our character archetypes — I mean, protagonists: Nya (Lex Scott Davis), her little brother (Joivan Wade), her heroic ex-boyfriend (Y’lan Noel) — wander wide-eyed through near-abandoned streets, it feels more like an overpriced haunted house than anything: out pops a guy in a scary mask waving a machete! Out pops a lunatic wearing a raincoat who sprays you with water! Oh no, hands grabbing at your ankles! These moments are so discrete and harmless you expect our heroes to collect a souvenir photo when all of it is over.
The premise of a “Purge” — the helplessness and anarchy of it — is so promising, it’s no wonder why they keep making these movies and why people (your reviewer among them) keep paying money to see them, expecting guilt-free, bloody mayhem, a symbolic two-hour Purge from the obligations of responsible consumerism.
Why then, does this film feel so cardboard? In part, no doubt, because of its self-seriousness (the moments of humor they do attempt to inject are awkward and misplaced) but also maybe because law-enforcement is never a considerable factor in horror movies, and so removing it, while fun in premise, doesn’t do much as a matter of actual practice. All horror movies find a way to nullify the comfort of an active and capable police force (“My phone is dead!” or “This cabin is so far away, police won’t be here for hours!”) until the final moments. “No police to help” is the precondition for good horror, but no more.
And early on, The First Purge teaches us that police aren’t a helpful factor in the lives of our characters: pre-Purge, a junkie slices a young drug-dealer in the face with a razor blade in his mouth. That same junkie is the one who goes on to hypodermic needle-stab someone else, but obviously he’s not someone who was patiently waiting for crime to be legal to really let loose: he already sliced our hero in the face! Where the Purge movies could have been about the slow — and then terrifyingly rapid — dismissal of morality and social norms, like High-Rise, it chooses instead to skate through those haunted house scares and clunky symbolism.
By the final third of this movie though, I’m not sure if you can call it symbolism at all, when it’s just the thing itself and not a representation of it: when people haven’t been murdering enough, the fascist government sends in mercenary racists to systemically gun people down. In a clear echo of the 2015 shooting in Charleston, neo-Nazis ride motorcycles away from a church whose congregants were slaughtered. The KKK glide in bloody sheets through the sheets. The leader of the unit assigned to murdering everyone in the protagonist’s apartment building is dressed like an SS officer, with his goons in minstrel black-face masks. (Were these costumes provided to these last-minute Purge missionaries or did they select people who already had them?)
These images are horrifying, but if 2018 has taught us anything, it’s that, even more horrifying, in the real world, the villains don’t wear bloody KKK hoods or twirling metaphorical moustaches. Evil is petty and banal. Racists love to begin their sentences with “I’m not a racist, but.” Neo-Nazis balk at the comparison to Nazis, and use the accusation as fuel to prove how outlandish and off base their enemies are. How much less terrifying the world would be then, if they were all wearing SS uniforms, and their power dissolved at sunrise.
At one point, as an organized militia armed with machine guns begin their march into the heroes’ apartment building to murder everyone inside, a neighbor earnestly pulls Nya aside and says she’s worried about the state of the country. A reminder: armed gunmen in Nazi costume are currently storming up her stairwell to remorselessly kill them. Hey lady, now’s not the time for an exaggerated wink to the audience. I promise, just dealing with The Purge would be interesting enough. C+",ew.com,2018-07-25 00:00:00,41,593236
"On any given day, in a sleepy rural village near Kalamata, a group of elderly men gather at the kafeneio for a drink and lively conversation. Nothing unusual about that until you get to know them.
Although they were all born in this village, at least half of them are called “the foreigners.” They are the ones who left many years ago as children or young men. Like many young people today, they left for a better future overseas.
However, life was much worse for them. They didn’t leave with university degrees; rather, they set out with barely more than the clothes on their back.
The oldest ones remember the horrors of war, hunger, and deaths at the hands of the invaders in the village square. But they all see this as the only place to spend their golden years. The reasons for their return are different but at the core identical, they have all come home.
They see their homeland very differently to those who never left. They will never be crushed by any crisis and can still feel the romance of Greece and see its potential.
They know that this wondrous country can survive anything.
They are the diaspora who have come home to live their retirement to the full. They have returned with a wealth of knowledge and financial stability. Their reflection has much to offer modern Greece.
Every morning, the aroma of freshly baked koulourakia has the same Proustian effect as the madeleines of 19th century Paris. It evokes memories of their youth, both joyous and sad, and prompts emotional and volatile conversations.
Among the group is a former New York taxi driver and a retired retailer from Boston. They also include a restaurateur from Montreal, a lawyer from Adelaide, a lecturer from Melbourne, a banker from Dusseldorf and a tailor from Paris.
One elderly gentleman is a little more “foreign” than the rest. His wife left the village at 19 years of age and bravely started a new life in Chicago. Fifty years later she has returned with her husband, an American-born Greek lawyer who now calls her village home.
There are others who migrate here every year for about six months to tend their olive groves and spend time with the family they left behind.
The Australian lawyer returned in his late 60s. For him this is the perfect base from which to explore Europe. He also has the luxury of being able to visit many sites less than an hour’s drive from his home anytime he feels the need for an ancient experience.
The Chicago lawyer, who came here in his 80s, is only half joking when he says he did it to avoid Trump’s America. A passionate historian who has enjoyed yearly visits to Greece, the sirens of antiquity have finally tethered him.
The Montreal restaurateur wanted to create a home that his Greek and Canadian family could all enjoy every summer. When alone, he and his wife can sit on their veranda for hours overlooking the mountains which surround their village.
These mature travelers are breathing gentle new life into the village. Old homes are being restored with respect to their historic integrity – now the main source of income for many local tradesmen.
Money is being infused into many businesses in the area by people with high disposable incomes – a rare commodity these days.
There are also long-term spin-offs from this gray invasion. Once-neglected family homes are now holiday magnets for the children and grandchildren of these expats. Maybe they will retire here as well one day.
In summer, the square is a hive of activity after a day at the beach for friends and family who now make an annual pilgrimage to what was once considered a dying village.
Like their spiritual ancestor Ulysses, these old travelers have finally come home, all the wiser for their experiences abroad.

"China will ""absolutely not"" fire the first shot in a trade war with the United States and will not be the first to levy tariffs, its finance ministry said on Wednesday.A person with knowledge of the plan earlier told Reuters China's threatened tariffs on $34 billion of U.S. goods would take effect from the beginning of the day on Friday. Given the 12-hour time difference, that would have put its implementation ahead of Washington's. Other media carried similar reports.But the ministry issued a brief clarification in response.""The Chinese government's position has been stated many times. We absolutely will not fire the first shot, and will not implement tariff measures ahead of the United States doing so,"" it said, without elaborating.Washington has said it would implement tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6, and Beijing has vowed to retaliate in kind on the same day.Earlier, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China was ready to act, though he did not confirm the start date for Chinese tariffs.""China has already made preparations,"" Lu told a daily news briefing.""As long as the United States issues a so-called tariff list, China will take necessary measures to firmly protect its legitimate interests,"" he added, without elaborating.China's yuan rose sharply against the dollar on Wednesday, a day after the central bank assured markets it would keep the currency stable amid growing worries about trade friction, although stocks fell.Chinese state media on Wednesday kept up a steady drum beat of criticism of the United States.The official China Daily said the United States was intentionally trying to prevent China from developing to keep it from challenging the former's role in the global economic order.""The U.S. has maintained hegemony in the military and financial fields for many decades. Now it is pursuing economic hegemony,"" the English-language newspaper said in an editorial.""It has frequently waged wars against other sovereign countries and made use of the dominant influence of the U.S. dollar in the international markets to fleece other countries. Now it is attempting to resort to an all-out trade and economic war to hold back China's normal development.""Widely-read tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, said the increasingly likely trade war would bring chaos to the world.""Counterstrike is major economies' first reaction to Washington's trade war,"" it said in its editorial.""It's hard to predict where these moves will lead the world, but Washington will unavoidably pay heavy prices for its attempts to change the whole world to its economic tributary.""U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to escalate the trade conflict with tariffs on as much as $400 billion in Chinese goods if Beijing retaliates against the U.S. tariffs set to take effect on Friday.Chinese currency and stock markets have been jittery ahead of Friday's tariff implementation.",www.news18.com,2018-07-20 00:00:00,15,200071
"Hundreds of thousands of Americans took to the streets last weekend to demand the Trump administration reunite kids and parents who were separated at the border.
A 6-year-old boy in Atlanta also had an idea: Make money by selling lemonade, and give it to someone who would help the families.
By last week, he and his family had raised more than $13,000—some through lemonade and bake sales, but the vast majority from a fundraiser on Facebook, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The money is going to the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, a Texas-based legal services nonprofit helping immigrants, refugees, and children.

As promised, we couldn’t end this week’s Recharge without some news about these cute black-and-white animals from China. Fewer than 2,000 pandas are left in the wild. A study led by a group of Chinese researchers says conserving land for pandas—considered an “umbrella species”—also helps other animals, such as golden monkeys and snow leopards. Conserving panda habitat also leads to more protected land, as well as opportunities for recreation and tourism. “The take-home message [of this study] is, it is worth it,” Ronald Swaisgood, one of the study authors, says. “It’s worth saving these endangered species because we benefit and nature benefits.” (Mother Jones)

After Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced she got a new puppy, we asked you to suggest some creative dog names for her. And wow, did you respond.
We also heard from Donald Trump Jr., who tried to troll us on Twitter, but your suggestions were far better.
Here are just some of our favorites:
“ Thurgood. No one fights for justice/equality quite like Elizabeth Warren & no one fought for justice/equality quite like Thurgood Marshall.”
“Rebel”
“Tuffy because she needs someone tough by her side.”
“Raza, it means hope. We need hope and Elizabeth Warren is, for me, the mother of hope. 😉”
“‘Spero,’ which is Latin for ‘hope’ and also an awesome doggo name!”
“Consumer watch dog”
“Dodd Frank”
“Anthony Scarapoochie”
“Dogged Pursuit”
“Endeavor”
“Hope”
“Percy,” short for persistence, and “Justice” were two of the most frequent suggestions.
Still no word from the senator on what she’s decided to name her pup, but let’s hope she takes some of your suggestions into consideration.",www.motherjones.com,2018-07-20 00:00:00,10,484389
"Hamilton vs. Jefferson
The Fourth of July celebrates America’s freedom from England. The delegates from the thirteen colonies adopted the Declaration of Independence, the document written by Thomas Jefferson that gave America its moral pulse. After the Continental Congress approved the final wording of the Declaration of Independence, the United States of America was born. Americans need to be grateful to Jefferson for giving us the language and values of liberty and freedom. Yet, by watching and listening to Lin-Manuel Miranda’s play “Hamilton” people will get the wrong impression of Hamilton and Jefferson. As Hamilton’s star has risen, Jefferson’s has fallen. In looking at the political views and policies of each man there should be a recognition of who is the elitist and who is the one supporting the common individual.
Jefferson strove to make the American government everything that the British government was not. As historian Ron Chernow said in his book Alexander Hamilton, Hamilton’s Federalist Party was “elitist in its politics and tended to doubt the wisdom of the common people.” No one ever mentions that Hamilton believed that the President should have power for life, similar to the King of England. Hamilton went so far as to call for a new Constitutional Convention to revise the Articles of Confederation. His plan was to have a permanent president who would appoint all the governors and who would have veto power over all state legislation. Under such a plan, state sovereignty would have been destroyed, and there would have been no escape from the central government's high taxes. Murray Rothbard, who wrote The Mystery of Banking, said Hamilton wished to “reimpose in the new United States a system of mercantilism and big government similar to that in Great Britain, against which the colonists had rebelled. The object was to have a strong central government, particularly a strong president or king as chief executive, built up by high taxes and heavy public debt.” Chernow goes on to say, “Jeffersonians called themselves Republicans, believing in limited federal power, a dominant Congress, and states’ rights who credited the wisdom of the common people.” In other words, he was an anti-Monarchist. Historian John Boles, who wrote Jefferson: Architect of Liberty, noted to American Thinker, “Jefferson was not opposed to strong government as long as it stayed within it Constitutional bounds. He believed in political power from the people.” Hamilton’s autocratic notions versus Jefferson’s beliefs can be viewed with their attitude toward a central bank. Granted, Hamilton was correct in recognizing that the U.S. economy was a total mess. The Revolutionary War had left a huge debt with no plans on how it would be paid off. Some states simply repudiated the debt, making it more difficult for other states to borrow money and rebuild their economies. Yet, Jefferson complained that the bank created a national banking elite and gave them extraordinary power and wealth at the expense of ordinary citizens of the country. Rothbard stated, the “Bank of North America was deliberately modeled after the Bank of England. The Bank was given a monopoly privilege of its notes being receivable in all tax payments to state and federal government, and no other banks were permitted to operate in the country. It graciously agreed to lend most of its newly created money to the federal government, while the hapless taxpayers would have to pay the Bank principal and interest."" Because the bank would have unprecedented control over the economy it would also have leverage over the government. Jefferson believed this would render U.S. commercial policy hostage to Britain. He warned that this policy concentrated powers in the hands of a small number of wealthy men in only one section of the country. This British domination of American trade harmed this nation’s economy and crippled small local industries. Boles noted that even a fellow Federalist, President John Adams, became more and more convinced that Hamilton was the largest threat to the constitutional form of government, someone with Napoleonic ambitions. Those who enjoyed the Hamilton play should remember that it has a fictional element to it. In reality Hamilton wanted an Aristocratic America, and that is was Jefferson who was protective of individual rights. This July Fourth people should refer back to history, not revisionist history, to understand the beliefs of Alexander Hamilton versus Thomas Jefferson. The author writes for American Thinker. She has done book reviews, author interviews, and has written a number of national security, political, and foreign policy articles.",www.americanthinker.com,2018-07-20 00:00:00,33,450491
"Happy 4th of July! Thank God, we are independent!
I believe it is a wonderful time to be American and celebrate the 4th of July in America. But not everyone seems to think so. According to a USAToday poll, only 42% of Americans are proud to be Americans. This, despite the fact that a lot of people from around the world are trying to get in here, and very few of the people who threatened to leave the U.S. if President Trump got elected have kept their promise. Yet here we are. Here's how USAToday reported it, starting with the mush-mouthed headline:
Poll: On the 4th, what symbolizes the best (and worst) of America? It depends whom you ask A new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll about patriotism, pegged to this week’s celebration of the Fourth of July, finds an overwhelming majority of those surveyed say they are proud to be Americans. But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. I do get a kick out of the federal worker quoted in the article referring to Trump as a totalitarian after he sat through eight years of President Obama. Here's what the discontented little fellow had to say: “This is a very difficult time,” says Daniel Kugler, 66, a federal worker from Washington, D.C., who was among those polled. “There’s not the norms that used to hold; they are not holding anymore.” He worries about “a slide toward a totalitarian situation” in which Congress and others are afraid to speak up against President Trump. As a federal worker, he was obviously extremely proud and happy that Obama was transferring power and money from the rest of the U.S. to the government as fast as he could, and that made the area around Washington D.C. very wealthy. It is sad that he and others don’t recognize how harmful that is to the rest of us, or else doesn’t care. But here's how I, and most of us in the heartland of America, sees it: I am truly proud to be an American, as I always have been, especially since we now have a president who: Has a goal to “Make America Great Again,” instead of a president who wants to remake America.
Is trying to give the power and purse back to the people through fewer regulations and lower taxes, instead of a president who does everything he can to make the government more powerful.
Has given us economic policies that have lowered unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics to all-time lows, instead of a president whose policies encourage people to be more dependent on government.
Focuses on bringing back manufacturing jobs instead of constantly increasing regulations and declaring manufacturing jobs gone for good.
Understands that if goods production continually moves to other countries, then eventually the same will come to our service industries, destroying our economy.
Knows that capitalism is great and allowing corporations to keep more of the money they earn will help achieve economic growth and give people the opportunity to move up the economic ladder. That beats the confiscation seen in the previous administration.
Seeks to enforce immigration laws that Congress passed and who recognizes that a country without borders is a very dangerous country; instead of a president who picked and chose which laws to enforce.
Absolutely never considered ISIS the JV Team.
Has not left Americans to die while concocting a lie about a video to protect his political power.
Has helped Ukraine defend itself against the Russians as we promised to do instead of being “flexible” with the Russians.
Is pushing NATO countries to pay what they promised to pay, instead of having America bear the brunt of the cost.
Does not give hundreds of billions of dollars to Iran to spread terrorism around the world, let alone pledges death to Israel and America.
Keeps a promise to move our embassy to Jerusalem instead of previous presidents who made empty promises.
Gives people the freedom of choice of what type of health insurance to buy instead of a president who wants complete government control.
Does not illegally spy on thousands of Americans, including those who are political opponents.
Does not use the IRS to stifle the free speech of political opponents.
Does not have a gun-running operation to service Mexican smuggling cartels called 'Fast and Furious.'
Believes that cities and states should follow laws that Congress passes, including immigration laws.
Understands that the climate has changed naturally through billions of years; instead of a president who is so arrogant he believes the government can control temperatures, sea levels and storm activity forever if people and businesses just fork over trillions of dollars.
Wants to produce more oil, instead of a president who does not care whether the price rises to unsustainable levels. I am sure people can think of many more things they are currently proud of after eight years of a president who dictatorially bragged that he could rule with a pen and a phone. Finally, I am extremely thankful and proud that we had Founding Fathers who knew that the power needed to reside in the hands of the people instead of the central government. They understood that if only the king and the government had guns, they would also have all the power. We would not be free if the people were unable to arm themselves in the many necessary wars we have had, as well as in other ways, to protect our freedom.",www.americanthinker.com,2018-07-20 00:00:00,40,450575
"Illegal Immigrants, Palestinian Refugees, and Their Liberal Cheerleaders: The Startling Similarities
The Democrat, left-wing media, and progressive activists’ current freak-out over what is at least a decade-long crisis on our southern border is not just hypocritical. Yes, these same individuals taking to the streets in ugly mobs and threatening Trump administration officials and their families were silent when children entering the country illegally were detained under Obama. In fact, in 2014, after visiting a detention center housing migrant children, Nancy Pelosi asserted that the issue should not be politicized, clearly fearing the poor optics. But the progressive reaction to the migrant issue reflects much more than liberal hypocrisy. It mirrors the liberal response to, and furthering of, inflammatory and intentionally misleading narratives regarding Palestinian refugees. Both crises represent the politicization of cultural and ethnic tragedies that seek to blame a strong horse for the wrongs of the true perpetrators of crimes against humanity. And both crises serve as winning strategies for leftist political operatives seeking absolute power.
Palestinians are portrayed as victims of an all-powerful government infringing on their human rights, notwithstanding their culpability and that of their “elected” leaders. Similarly, Democrats are using illegal immigrants as tools to demonize Republicans, intentionally fueling their ongoing war against conservatives with the specific goal of influencing the midterm elections. Arab governments have exploited Palestinians for decades in their never-ending quest to annihilate Israel. That conflict could have ended decades ago, yet Palestinian representatives declined Israel’s numerous offers of a peaceful two-state solution. Democrats similarly purposely avoided numerous opportunities for immigration reform including when they controlled both houses of Congress and the White House under Obama. Instead, Democrats nationalized one-sixth of the U.S. economy via Obamacare, while illegal immigrant children languished in prison-like camps. They opted to “ink” a horrific agreement with Iran allowing that terrorist-sponsoring tyrannical regime to develop nuclear weapons while turning a blind eye to our porous border that permits the infiltration of Islamic terrorists and MS-13 gang members. How to explain this irrationality? Aside from political motivations, there are enormous economic benefits to using unwitting victims in both of these dishonest games. Since its formation in 1949, the United Nations Relief Works Agency (UNRWA), mandated with providing humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees, has grown into a bureaucratic monstrosity that sucks money from donor nations to feed its 35,000 mostly Palestinian employees. It supports Palestinian terrorism through coordination with Hamas, indoctrinates Palestinian children to commit jihad against Jews, and allows its facilities to serve as weapons depots. But hey, tens of thousands of Arabs are employed because of it – so there’s that. Palestinians are the only refugees with their own UN agency. That agency is the only refugee organization that does not work for integration, resettlement and assimilation of its refugees into host countries. Furthermore, UNRWA permits descendants of refugees to inherit the refugee status, resulting in the number of refugees under its mandate and control increasing from 750,000 in 1950 to over 5,000,000 today. With an annual budget exceeding $1.2 billion, this is what we call big business. Our own government is now feeding a similar conglomerate in states across the country. Southwest Key Inc., a Texas not-for-profit, received half a billion dollars this year to house migrant children. It has received $1.5 billion over the past decade for the “Unaccompanied Alien Children Program.” The CEO of Southwest earned almost $1.5 million in total compensation in 2016 while his wife earned almost $300,000 as its VP in 2015. This is how government bureaucracies form and welfare programs are established. Genies are not easily forced back into their bottles. Bleeding hearts bemoan the migrant children, ignore their crimes and accompanying health issues, and champion the facilities in which the children are housed. In Westchester County, the feds have set up migrant housing in which most Americans could only dream of living. Gyms replete with weight rooms and indoor swimming pools, cell phones, medical care, and top-notch education are some of the amenities. Both of these crises are portrayed as atrocities with no end. Liberals perpetuate the narratives. Just as many Latin American countries do not wish to rectify their economic, social, and political calamities leaving citizens few choices but to attempt an escape, Arab countries and Palestinian leaders do not wish to address the struggles facing Palestinians. Deported illegals return again and again until finally jailed for serious crimes; liberals form sanctuary cities to protect them. Palestinian refugees seek a right of return while blowing up buses and restaurants; the UN passes resolutions condemning the Jews. Trump suggests building a wall; he is labeled a tyrant. Netanyahu builds a fence; he is accused of running an apartheid state. Both leaders strive to protect their citizens. Liberals wish to perpetuate victim classes as a means to attain power. While there are hopes that the U.S. will defund UNRWA, European nations would surely make up the loss. Similarly, if the government were to cut funding for immigrant welfare programs, liberals would fill the void. For instance, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services received $18 million in contributions from a Facebook campaign. The group plans to use the money “to staff up — hiring many more attorneys, social workers and legal assistants.” Sounds a lot like the way UNRWA expanded. Liberals feed the beast without any attempt to slay the dragon. The media and fake news also help inflame the public which keeps the money flowing and the issues front and center while continuing the demonization of both Israel and Republicans. Pallywood has found great success as Arabs effectively feed a false narrative to a complicit media influencing public opinion. The terrorists’ effectiveness in using #fakenews to portray the Palestinians as victims of unwarranted, “disproportionate” Israeli aggression is due in large part to liberals who care more about appeasing their own sense of fairness than they do about the truth. The duplicitous media faithfully regurgitate the lies fed to them by the terrorists. Likewise, news outlets across the country consistently run photos and stories that fit their bleeding-heart, false narratives. Time Magazine’s recent cover photo exemplifies the media’s deviousness as AT’s Rick Moran explains: They called it a ""photo illustration."" But the montage was not marked as such, leading anyone who saw the cover to think that Trump was there and the little girl was crying because her mother was taken away by heartless ICE agents. ""Photo illustrations"" are reminiscent of propaganda tactics used by Joseph Goebbels. The Nazi propaganda whiz would marry two images - a Jew and a rat, for example - to impart an unmistakable message. That too, was fake but accurate according to Nazi doctrine. Which leads to another similarity between the two issues – the ludicrous use of Hitler and Nazi comparisons. Both Palestinians and their supporters and Democrats and leftists love comparing Netanyahu and Trump to Hitler, Israeli Jews and Republicans to Nazis. This is not only immoral; it cheapens the memory of those who died in the Holocaust and WWII. There is no sense of truth or decency for the extremists pushing these vile agendas. I recently met a co-founder of Center Left Radio, which bills itself as “the progressive voice of hope, politics and jazz,” an internet station that is intended to appeal “to listeners’ hearts and minds.” We discussed the immigrant crisis and, when I shared with him that many of the heart-wrenching photos in the news were actually taken in 2014 under Obama, he would have none of it. It did not fit his narrative; his listeners’ minds, just as his own, could not grasp the reality. It is disheartening that so many in the West cannot handle the truth. When Trump asks why everyone screaming about the poor immigrant children ignores the children murdered by MS-13 gang members, liberals have no response. When the UN, Arab nations, and Western progressives single out Israel for demonization while ignoring the untold numbers of innocent Israeli civilians murdered in terrorist attacks, they fail to recognize this as blatant anti-Semitism. Unlike his predecessor, who never found an issue unworthy of an executive order (except this one), Trump signs an executive order halting the separation of children from parents and Democrats continue demonizing him while calling for the abolition of ICE. Netanyahu makes overtures for peace including halting settlement construction and Western media’s use of Pallywood propaganda continues its vilification of him. The Palestinians have their Nakba; the Democrats have their Resistance. For the Palestinians, 1967 was the beginning of a tale that they have successfully spun, a welfare state in the form of UNRWA that indirectly funds their terrorism, and an excuse to commit jihad on the Jewish people. Palestinian leaders, with the help of UNRWA textbooks and educators, incite violence daily in the name of the Nakba. For Democrats and leftists, 2016 was a death knell and an excuse to call for violence, uncivil disobedience, impeachment, and the usurpation of the laws of our Constitutional democracy. Obama and his minions are leading the charge in the Resistance that is tearing our country apart. For both, innocent people are used as pawns in order to further dangerous agendas intended to keep the bad guys in power.",www.americanthinker.com,2018-07-20 00:00:00,72,450437
"It got caught selling anti-Trump ""Impeach 45"" t-shirts, imagining that that's a product that their customers will lap up instead of call a consumer boycott on. You know, the ones in Ohio and Wisconsin who voted for you-know-who. Half the voting base of the United States, actually. After all, what could be more thrilling than wearing a mobile billboard declaring that one's voting choices were stupid? According to reports, the Walmart stock included even baby clothes. Who doesn't thrill at politicizing baby clothes?
According to Business Insider:
The hashtag “BoycottWalmart” began trending on Twitter after a conservative commentator and political analyst discovered the popular supermarket chain was selling “Impeach Trump” and “Impeach 45” shirts. Ryan Fournier, an advocate for President Donald Trump, discovered Walmart selling an array of clothing and merchandise which called for the impeachment of the 45th president of the United States. He posted a screenshot of the controversial clothing on Twitter. Soon his discovery went viral, with people tweeting in outrage against Walmart. One Twitter user wrote: “@Walmart as of this day you have lost me as a consumer. What an idiotic thing to do by putting impeach 45 clothing on your website. The very idea that you have decided to convicted someone without due process is astounding. #boycottWalmart” “Someone should come out with arrest 44 t-shirt, I would buy it RT @marklutchman: JUST IN: Walmart is now selling Impeach 45 baby clothes on their website. Anyone else willing to #BoycottWalmart? I know I am,” another user said.
Which is what makes you wonder what Walmart could have been thinking. Here is a screengrab from Twitter on what the tshirts look like:
You'd think they'd know better. But to be fair, it doesn't seem to be as bad a blunder as the one Target made, when it opted to sell Che Guevara CD cases for the Christmas 2007 season, triggering an outraged consumer boycott (following an editorial about it here.) Walmart's explanations and actions to remove the offending objects suggests a slightly different problem.
That's because what we are seeing here, according to the company, may well be leftovers, the junk that didn't sell, and as a result, it was left up on the website. For offended Trumpsters, that's actually something to smile about.
Business Insider found that Walmart did try to sell something to please every political point of view, including some pro-Trump stuff to serve the market as it were. Walmart itself said that its tshirts came as part of a bulk package of designs, probably from someplace like China, which included a little of everything but required the company to take all of it. It would be natural then for them to try to just unload the whole shebang.
Given Walmart's customer base, it's quite possible that the pro-Trump stuff blew off the shelves and all that was left was the other side of things -- the fashionable leftist side, sort of suggesting that Walmart has now decided that its customer base is comprised of hipsters. Maybe the 'Impeach Trump' shirts seemed prominent on the website because they were actually all that was left.
If that's the case, then the signs are there that President Trump remains popular, more popular than any of the left's fashionable causes. The Trump stuff is outselling the leftist stuff, and therefore, is harder to get.
Retailers are usually pretty savvy about knowing the importance of not offending one's customer. In a competitive marketplace, with Costco and Target nipping at its heels, Walmart presumably would know that its customers, if offended, have other places to go. Pro-Trump customers know the company has a growing reputation for progressivism, and are likely to be suspicious of that, which is likely why they are cautious. Rather than an amazing instance of bad commercial judgment, Walmart's backtrack on this, resulting in its pulling the items and apologizing to angry customers, is more likely a sign that the anti-Trump stuff isn't selling the way the pro-Trump stuff is.
We didn't see any lefty boycott of that when that was going on. I'm gonna guess it went too quick.",www.americanthinker.com,2018-07-20 00:00:00,35,450578
"President Trump on Friday blasted what he described as a media double standard on immigration, as he honored families whose loved ones were killed by illegal immigrants and accused the press of ignoring them to focus on the plight of migrants caught crossing the border.
The utter hypocrisy of the left could not be on more blatant display. On Friday, June 23, President Trump held a meeting with the group called Angels Families, the families of people who have been killed, mostly murdered, by illegal aliens. According to Fox News :
After a week of saturation coverage on illegal immigrant parents separated from their children -- a policy Trump reversed under public and political pressure -- the president stressed that so-called Angel Families have been “permanently separated.” The families, whose children and other relatives were killed by illegal immigrants, echoed that message during the White House event. “You don’t hear these stories,” said Steve Ronnebeck, whose 21-year-old son Grant was killed by an illegal immigrant over a pack of cigarettes. “But this is permanent separation.”
Contrast this with a story that has garnered worldwide attention -- the fate of a dozen boys and their soccer coach found this week alive in a flooded cave complex in northern Thailand. From the Wall Street Journal:
Medics are also starting the youths on easily digestible foods and shakes to gradually build up their strength. The Thai SEAL team also includes a psychologist who is helping the boys recover from the mental strain of being trapped underground for so long. To that end, engineers Tuesday were laying a telephone line to where the boys are located so they can speak with their families outside. A member from one of the international dive teams said electricians and engineers are laying cables and lighting along a route from the cave entrance to a forward base around a mile-and-a-quarter inside. He said they form part of a “daisy chain” of divers, who take turns to swim approximately 100 yards with supplies and equipment before passing it to the diver next in line. The diver, who asked not the be identified, said the rescue team comprised divers from several countries, including Australia, Britain, China, and the U.S. “It’s amazing how when you’ve got people together and nobody speaks each other’s language you can still make yourself understood,” he said.
The contrast could not be more stark. Nearly the same number of children, in one case killed or murdered and in the other case stranded in a cave, yet the whole world is mobilized by the left-wing media swarming over the latter. This odious hatred of President Trump and his kindness is worse than fake news or even propaganda. This is evil.",www.americanthinker.com,2018-07-20 00:00:00,16,450523
"Terror group Al-Shabaab bans use of plastic bags in Somalia
The terror group Al-Shabaab apparently cares about our planet. They all of a sudden are going green in an attempt to save planet earth. It is becoming clear that Al-Shabaab, like their sympathizers on the left have suddenly gotten their priorities straight. Saving the earth from the evil of plastic bags certainly trumps cutting off people's heads and or blowing them up, don't you think? The BBC (apparently not the Onion) reports:
The radical Al-Shabaab now seems to have another thing in common with the modern day left. It is apparent both are becoming comfortable in using selective outrage, virtue signaling and moral relativism to impose their agenda upon the rest of us. It is obvious now that no amount of hyperbole or virtue signaling becomes too much when it comes to pushing an agenda. Al-Shabaab and the left, two radical movements becoming more alike every single day.

"The only problem was, this new capital would be built on a parasite-infested swamp. It still is. Five years earlier in a letter, George Washington had applauded the region for farming as it “contains an inexhaustible supply of manure”. It still does.
At George Washington’s inauguration in April of 1789, New York was our new Republic’s capital. Less than a year later, a deal was struck by Jefferson, Madison, and Hamilton to move the capital to the mouth of the Potomac. The North would benefit by having Congress assume the States’ debts, and the South would have a capital closer to home.
Even before Pierre Charles L’Enfant began draining the swamp to build the capital, land speculators had swept in and deals of every kind were brokered for proximity to the new power center and hopes of future profit.
Fast forward to today. In the Oscar-nominated film The Post, a Washington-D.C. newspaper owner and editor are trying to choose whether to publish a story. Their decision, however, is complicated by the fact that both are close to a number of leading politicians. Perhaps too close.
Katharine Graham struggles to decide whether to publish a story and betray her long-time friend, former defense secretary Robert McNamara. They run in the same circles and go to the same parties, often thrown by Graham herself. Her editor is used to vacationing on President Kennedy’s yacht. But these are just facts of nature in the nation's capital. In “the swamp”, the well-connected enjoy a level of protection most people don’t.
Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, and one of the richest people in America, now owns the Washington Post and he’s eager to play the happy host. “What he’s going to do is revive the legacy of Kay Graham and her great socializing -- bringing smart, interesting people together in a social context,” his friend Jean Case tells Washingtonian magazine. Another friend says the same thing. “It’s a bit of a mystery to me -- whether he has political ambitions or thinks he needs to be on the right side of Washington, for Amazon.” This friend tells Washingtonian that “Bezos is attracted -- like a moth to light -- to Washington.” And naturally, for anyone looking for business opportunities, being active in Washington is a big plus.
But as Alan Greenspan once said, “Crony capitalism is essentially a condition in which... public officials are giving favors to people in the private sector in payment of political favors.” And this is where the problem lies.
As the Wall Street Journal explains, the federal government is a big Amazon customer and it’s only growing bigger. “GBH Insights, a research firm, predicts that Amazon’s government business will grow to $2.8 billion in 2018 and $4.6 billion in 2019, up from less than $300 million in 2015,” the Journal reported this year. “Other company analysts say those projections are optimistic, but not implausible.”
In fairness, Bezos already has many friends in high places even before hosting the best dinner parties in the nation’s capital. He’s a member of something called the Alfalfa Club, where the powerful from all walks of life cross paths. From senators to soldiers, it is an ideal way to mingle with the sort of people who can help throw billions of dollars’ worth of federal spending to Amazon.
The Washingtonian goes on to note that the Pentagon has acknowledged that defense secretary James Mattis, “receives individual advice from Bezos from time to time. Mattis’s regulatory sway over Bezos’s rocket company, Blue Origin -- which plans to pursue national-security launch contracts -- was important enough for Bezos to host him in Seattle last year.” Amazon is also seeking a Defense Department contract that could be worth $10 billion over a decade. It’s also working to change the law so government employees can buy more things directly from Amazon.com.
Jeff Bezos is considering putting Amazon’s HQ 2 in the D.C. area. Three of the 20 competing bids are around the Beltway. That would give him and his company even more influence over federal policy.
Cronyism is easy to see, but difficult to prove. Perhaps Amazon is earning all its government contracts on a level playing field. Perhaps Bezos was simply looking for a nice place to live, one with a renowned local newspaper he could buy. But that’s not how it looks. Amazon has come to the swamp where the inexhaustible supply of manure still permeates the air.

"Today's protest marchers are not heroes
In a world fraught with strife and chaos, there is always one thing we can always count on for amusement: protest marches. Instead of actually doing something about school shootings, sexual harassment, or racism, progressives hold their breaths until they turn blue in the face, jump up and down, and then generally join a march. In January, 2017, to protest the election of Donald Trump as President and to demonstrate outrage at his obscene comment that he was empowered to “grab women by the pussy,” approximately one million women staged a march on Washington, D.C., where they wore knitted pink “pussy hats” (apparently to “make a statement” and “reclaim” the offensive term as their own). In March of this year, hundreds of thousands marched against gun violence following the Florida school shooting shouting “never again” (a reference to the Holocaust), joined by celebrities George Clooney, Kim Kardashian, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, Paul McCartney, Cher, Justin Timberlake, and Amy Poehler, among others. On June 28th, hundreds gathered at the Hart Senate Office Building to protest the administration’s cruel immigration tactics which include separating parents from children (although the practice had been stopped). The mostly female crowd chanted “What do we want? Free families!” and “This is what democracy looks like.” Over five hundred were arrested, fined $50, and released. The activist actress Susan Sarandon was among those arrested. A friend of mine got herself arrested as well. She proudly posted a picture on FaceBook. Commentators greeted her as if she was Rosa Parks. “So proud of you!” “You go girl!” “You’re my hero!” And the inevitably irritating “woohoo…”
On June 30th, several thousand protesters gathered in Washington to demand the end to child separation at our borders a (apparently still not having received word that the practice had been abandoned). The ninety-degree weather seems to have diminished the size of the crowd, but not its enthusiasm or sense of camaraderie. These fun-filled protests should not be confused with actually doing something meaningful, and the protesters should not be greeted as “heroes.” They have no real skin in the game. It's not as if they are actually risking anything or facing any adverse consequences for their actions. They are not civil rights activists in the South facing off against the pit bulls of Alabama sheriffs. They are not Muhammed Ali giving up the world championship to protest the war in Vietnam. And they certainly should not be compared to members of the underground “Resistance” (a term today’s protesters have obscenely appropriated) during World War II who risked their lives and the lives of their families in armed combat against the vastly superior forces of the German Reich. What is at stake in getting arrested in the comfort of the Hart Office Building and paying a $50.00 fine? These are not heroes. These are not Resistance fighters. These are just hipster millennials missing yoga class so that they can all feel good about themselves when the day is done and post about it on social media. Protesters could really do something meaningful about the matters that rightly concern them. They could volunteer (as I have) to go down to South Texas and actually help the besieged, traumatized immigrants. There are many civil rights organizations desperately seeking volunteers (such as this one). But dealing with the oppressive heat and humidity of South Texas, not to mention bugs as big as pussy hats, is not as pleasant as lying on yoga mats in the Hart Building. So to the pussy hat wearers of the world, I say “woohoo.” To those seriously concerned about the direction of our country, I say, “let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work.” Steve Frank retired after the last Presidential election following a thirty-year career as an appellate lawyer with the United States Department of Justice.

"Trump's burden: Cleaning up Obama's mess
President Trump is unraveling eight years of Obama tyranny. Here is a little reminder why so many people now stand shoulder to shoulder with President Trump. President Trump has chosen to unravel the last eight years of Obama's tyranny one day at a time. Trump is now reversing the negative Obama tide by simply implementing basic commonsense economic policies. The combination of this commonsense approach with tax cuts and the reversal of countless Obama executive order EPA regulations has resulted in a booming economy. Do you really think Obama cared about the middle class economically, or did he just take all of us for fools with his love of job-killing EPA regulations? These regulations did nothing but destroy American jobs and add costs to American-made products and U.S. private businesses. They had absolutely no real effect on the environment. Trump's reversal of these Obama regulations has brought back many U.S. jobs, and this has become the main contributing factor in revitalizing numerous U.S. industries.
Why would a president who cared about peace and security in the Middle East and the world recklessly remove U.S. troops from Iraq? Was Obama the Manchurian candidate? The devastating negative repercussions of Obama's removal of U.S. troops from Iraq will surely be felt for many decades. ISIS in filling up the power vacuum within the Middle East has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. Trump has since cleaned up the ISIS mess, and it took him less than a year to do it. Was Obama's compliance in enabling the terror state of Iran to receive 150 million (correction: billion) dollars to basically self-regulate its nuclear program something that made the world a safer place? Thank God Trump has removed the U.S. from such a diabolical, one-sided ""deal."" The current uprisings in Iran might just take care of this problem. There will be no reprieve for the Iranian mullahs this time, not from President Trump. If Obama was really interested in defending the U.S. Constitution, why did he attempt to give amnesty to thousands of DACA kids with just a stroke of his pen? He repeatedly told the American people he had no legal right to do that, but he did it anyway. Now it's another Obama mess conveniently left in the lap of President Trump. What U.S. president encourages a wide open border and all the ills that come with it? Seems as if most American citizens agree with Trump and want a secure border. Building a wall should be a priority for those of us who believe in basic security and American sovereignty. Obama was a president who seemed to have an affinity for using various government agencies as a weapon against many U.S. citizens. Remember the unlawful seizing of the AP writer's phone records? How about the Tea Party IRS scandal, where the government is now currently paying out millions to many U.S. conservative citizens? Do we dare even mention the current Obama-gate: the FBI, DOJ, NSA, and CIA, apparently all woven together in coordination for the purpose of being weaponized to spy on the Trump campaign and change the course of a presidential election? How many messes were left for President Trump to clean up? The last eight years of systemic corruption, treason, and tyranny should be a constant reminder to all of us who value freedom to keep holding our leaders accountable for their words and actions. This is a reminder and wake-up call for all of us who still remember what can happen to a country under the spell of willful ignorance. Huge messes pile up, with the responsible people stuck cleaning it all up. Trump is the president given the responsibility of cleaning up the eight years of Obama tyranny. He is doing a pretty good job.",www.americanthinker.com,2018-07-20 00:00:00,34,450458
"All are in good health and are getting food and medicine delivered to the cave thanks to Thai navy SEALS, medics and divers. But those working to save them cannot say yet when or how, exactly, the boys and their coach will be extracted.
Having lived through a similar ordeal, Reygadas had a message for the boys.
- Advertisement - “They should think only about leaving and reuniting with their families.”
“They should think only about leaving and reuniting with their families,” Reygadas told The Associated Press on Tuesday, adding that their coach will be key to keeping them motivated.
The boys, who are ages 11 through 16, have to help one another, he said.
“It’s terrible for them — they’re little — but I believe that boys with a lot of strength are going to manage to be whole when they get out,” Reygadas said.
He recalled times when he and his fellow miners doubted they would be rescued. Faith, prayer and humor kept them sane, he said.
“They shouldn’t be ashamed to be scared,” he said of the boys. “Because we were scared, too. Our tears also ran. Even as adult men, we cried.”
The miners, who were trapped below Chile’s Atacama desert, were saved when a special capsule was lowered down a drilled shaft and raised them to the surface one by one.
In the case of the Thai soccer team, a rescue is a race against time.
Thai SEALS posted photos on Facebook on Wednesday morning of rescuers working in chest-deep water in the cave, adding that they were pumping water as “fast as possible” as they preppared to bring out the stranded group, Reuters reported.
And monsoon rains due in coming days could push water levels dangerously higher.
The boys do not know how to swim. Thai officials, while eager to pull them out, say they do not want to risk further endangering the team by rushing an evacuation.
“We need to be 100 percent confident,” said Narongsak Osatanakorn, the province’s governor. “If there is a risk, we will not move them out.”
Despite their ordeal, the boys seem to be in good spirits.
In the videos released Wednesday morning, the boys, many wrapped in foil blankets, introduce themselves by name and say they are in good health. A SEAL is seen treating minor cuts on the boys’ feet. Several boys are laughing as the SEALs joke around with them.

BEIRUT — The Syrian government on Tuesday called on refugees to return, saying it has successfully cleared large areas of “terrorists.”
The rare appeal reflects the government’s growing confidence after more than seven years of war. While officials usually appeal to Syrians abroad to return during television appearances and interviews, this is the first formal appeal broadcast on official media.
Syrian government forces, with crucial support from Russia and Iran, recently retook large areas near the capital, Damascus, and are waging a new offensive in the south that U.N. officials say has displaced more than 270,000 people.
The U.N. Security Council scheduled closed consultations for Thursday on the offensive and rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in the southwest at the request of Sweden and Kuwait.
The government currently controls over 61 percent of Syria, compared to early 2017, when it held just 17 percent, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which closely monitors the conflict.
The government refers to all rebels as “terrorists.”
Over 5.6 million Syrians have fled the country. The Foreign Ministry says many internally displaced have already returned home, urging refugees to do same.
Many Syrians are unable to return because their homes were destroyed in the fighting, or because they fear military conscription or retribution from government forces.
Also on Tuesday, a senior U.N. official visited a Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus that government forces recaptured in May. The Yarmouk camp, a built-up residential area once home to tens of thousands of Palestinians and Syrians, was held by Islamic State group and other insurgents for years, and saw heavy fighting.",www.41nbc.com,2018-07-18 00:00:00,12,50647

British police are reportedly investigating three new sexual assault allegations against Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey, including one accusation that dates back more than two decades.
Kevin Spacey at Build Studio on May 24, 2017 in New York City.Daniel Zuchnik / WireImage
The allegations against Spacey, the former artistic director of the Old Vic theater in London, were first reported by TMZ and later confirmed by police to Variety.
London’s Metropolitan Police had previously confirmed three other investigations against Spacey, bringing the total to six. He also faces a wave of sexual misconduct allegations in the United States.
British police, who do not publicly identify suspects in many crime cases, provided NBC News with details about the three new allegations that matched those in the TMZ report. They did not name Spacey.
Five months ago, on Feb. 8, a man reported that he had been sexually assaulted in 2008 in Lambeth, the London borough that is home to the Old Vic.
That same month, on Feb. 14, a man reported that he had been sexually assaulted in 2013 in Gloucester.
And two months later, on April 17, a man reported that he had been sexually assaulted in 1996 in Westminster.
Officials with Scotland Yard’s Child Abuse and Sexual Offenses Command are investigating the accusations, police said in a statement.
The reports come amid news from a recent interview with actor Guy Pearce, who co-starred with Spacey in the 1997 noir thriller “L.A. Confidential.”
In an interview Tuesday with Australian talk show host Andrew Denton, Pearce called the actor a “handsy guy.”
“Tough one to talk about at the moment,” said Pearce, who is Australian. “Amazing actor. Incredible actor. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah. He’s a handsy guy. Thankfully, I was 29, and not 14.”
“Star Trek: Discovery” actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of making a sexual advance at him in 1986, when Rapp was 14 and Spacey was in his mid-20s.
Spacey, now 58, issued an apology after Rapp’s allegations were reported by BuzzFeed.
He then virtually disappeared from Hollywood. He was fired from the Netflix series “House of Cards” and cut from the film “All the Money in the World.”",www.41nbc.com,2018-07-18 00:00:00,22,50479

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was charged in court Wednesday with criminal breach of trust and corruption, two months after a multibillion-dollar graft scandal at a state investment fund led to his shock election defeat.
He pleaded not guilty to all charges. “I claim trial,” he said in a barely audible voice as he stood in the dock at the High Court in Kuala Lumpur. Prosecutors have demanded $1 million bail.
The patrician and luxury-loving Najib, wearing a suit and a red tie, appeared calm and smiled as he was escorted into the court complex. He had been arrested Tuesday by anti-graft officials over a suspicious transfer of 42 million ringgit ($10.4 million) into his bank accounts from SRC International, a former unit of the 1MDB state investment fund that U.S. investigators say was looted of billions by associates of Najib.
He was charged with abuse of power leading to gratification under Malaysia’s anti-corruption law and three counts of criminal breach of trust. Each charge has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Whipping is also a penalty but Najib would be exempt because of his age.
Najib, 64, has accused Malaysia’s new government of seeking “political vengeance.”
In a recorded video posted on social media hours after his arrest, Najib apologized to Malaysians but remained defiant.
“As a normal human being, I am not perfect but believe me, that the accusations against me and my family are not all true,” he said.
New Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad reopened investigations into 1MDB that were stifled under Najib’s rule.
Najib set up 1MDB when he took power in 2009 but the fund amassed billions in debts and is being investigated in the U.S. and several other countries.
He and his wife were questioned last month over the SRC case by the anti-graft agency and have both been barred from leaving the country. Police have also seized jewelry and valuables valued at more than 1.1 billion ringgit ($272 million) from properties linked to Najib.
U.S. investigators say $4.5 billion was stolen and laundered from 1MDB by Najib’s associates, including some $700 million that landed in Najib’s bank account.
Najib’s laywer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah asked for the case to be expedited.
Najib “is anxious to clear his name,” he told the High Court. “We are pretty confident about this case.”
Bridget Welsh, a Southeast Asia expert at John Cabot University in Rome, said Najib’s arrest was the “inevitable outcome” after he lost power.
“It shows the resolve of the new government to address previous abuses of power. It has been done judiciously so far and speaks to a needed reckoning for Malaysia and a key step toward a cleaner governance,” she said in an email.

LONDON — British police declared a “major incident” early Wednesday after two people were left critically ill following their suspected exposure to an “unknown substance” just a few miles from the scene of a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter.
Emergency services were twice called to a property in Amesbury, England, where a man, 45, and a woman, 44, were found unconscious Saturday.

In a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Wiltshire Police’s deputy chief constable Paul Mills said the pair had “been hospitalized following their potential exposure to an unknown substance.”
Paramedics were called on Saturday morning and “They were called back later the same day, supported by colleagues from Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service, following reports a man had also fallen unwell in the same location.”
Mills reiterated an earlier police statement, where authorities said they initially believed pair had taken contaminated heroin or crack cocaine, before investigating whether a different substance may have caused them to collapse.
“However, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill.”

London’s Metropolitan Police had earlier confirmed that counterterrorism officers were involved in the investigation.
Amesbury is seven miles from the town of Salisbury, where former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with military-grade nerve agent Novichok in March. The British government blamed Russia for the attack. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement.
Police emphasized that it was unclear whether a crime had been committed in the latest case.
However, they said five locations frequented by the pair around Amesbury and Salisbury were cordoned off as a “precautionary measure” on Wednesday.
In Salisbury, a supported housing complex for the homeless was cordoned off, located 840 feet from Zizzi’s, the restaurant the Skripal’s dined the evening they were poisoned. So too was Queen Elizabeth Gardens — a park just 1,300 feet from the location the Skripals were found collapsed.
Amesbury is located around five miles from Stonehenge, the prehistoric monument visited by more than a million people annually.
Salisbury District Hospital, where the pair are receiving treatment and the Skripals were patients in the aftermath of the March attack, remained open as normal on Wednesday.",www.41nbc.com,2018-07-18 00:00:00,15,50532

Scientists say they’ve used human test-tube baby techniques to try to save the nearly extinct northern white rhino.
In an improbable experiment, they are trying to resurrect an entire subspecies using dead males, two infertile remaining females, and some closely related southern white rhinos.
And they say they also plan to use stem-cell technology to try to create a population of pure northern white rhinos in the lab.
The European team of researchers created a few early-stage rhino embryos using a technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection or ICSI. They used sperm from the last northern white rhino males before they died. Some of this sperm was injected into egg cells taken from females of the southern white rhino subspecies.
They ended up with a handful of embryos, some of which could potentially be implanted into surrogate rhino mothers.
While any resulting baby rhinos would be hybrids — half northern and half southern white rhino — the experiment is a first step to re-creating an extinct subspecies in the lab, the researchers report in the journal Nature Communications.
Northern white rhinos were driven to extinction by poaching and war in the countries they once roamed — Chad, Sudan, Uganda, Congo and Central African Republic.
The last living male white northern white rhino, named Sudan, died last March. Two females remain in captivity, but they are infertile. No northern white rhinos remain in the wild.
Thomas Hildebrandt of the German Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin and colleagues in the Czech Republic and Italy, as well as in Japan, started an all-out effort to create new white rhinos in the lab.
“We didn’t have many options so we had to be realistic.”
They’ve succeeded in their first step – making hybrid embryos. “These are the first in-vitro produced rhinoceros embryos ever. They have a very high chance to establish a pregnancy once implanted into a surrogate mother,” Hildebrandt said in a statement.
It’s a tricky process. Rhinos are big and it’s not easy to make them cooperate. The females had to be anesthetized and a special tool used to collect their egg cells. “We … were highly afraid that something unexpected would happen during this procedure,” Hildebrandt told a telephone briefing.
And the frozen sperm was not the greatest. “The amount of semen is limited, is of poor quality, and has been obtained from only three bulls,” the team wrote in their report.
They hope to eventually implant their embryos into the more common southern white rhino females and then breed any resulting rhinos to try and concentrate their northern white rhino genes. For now, these early embryos, called blastocysts, have been frozen.
This will probably not be enough to save a whole subspecies, so the team is also using stem cell and cloning technology to try to make pure northern white rhinos. They pulled embryonic stem cells — the body’s master cells, from four of the blastocysts.
What they want to do is turn these embryonic stem cells into eggs and sperm using stem cell technology.
Chemical and genetic techniques can be used to get embryonic stem cells to turn into any cell type desired, including egg and sperm cells.
There’s a second way to make them, also. The team has tissue samples from northern white rhinos. They plan to use chemical and genetic techniques to transform these ordinary skin cells into more cells resembling embryonic stem cells. These lab-produced cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS cells.
In theory, these laboratory-made sperm and egg cells could be combined in a lab dish via in vitro fertilization (IVF) to make a pure northern white rhino embryo, which could be implanted into a southern white rhino surrogate mother.
The scientists hope they could make enough rhino babies this way to have a genetically diverse population that could, eventually, be re-introduced into their traditional range.
“Our results suggest that these methods could play a valuable role in the effort to save rhinoceros populations on the brink of extinction,” they wrote.

TUNIS, Tunisia — A woman from Tunisia’s moderate Islamic party was elected on Tuesday as mayor of the capital city, Tunis, the first time a woman holds the post.
Souad Abderrahim, a 54-year-old pharmacist of the Ennahdha party, won the post in the second round of voting by the municipal council. She defeated her top rival, Kamel Idir, of the party Nida Tounes, founded by the Tunisian president.
Abderrahim, a former lawmaker and militant for women’s rights, doesn’t wear a veil. She was the only winner so far among a half-dozen women from the Ennahdha party who competed for mayoral posts in the region around Tunis.
Tunisia’s municipal elections were held May 6, but newly-elected municipal councils are only now voting for mayors.
In 2016, Ennahdha declared that it was separating politics from religion, stepping away from the notion of political Islam typically embodied by Islamic parties.
Abderrahim said in an interview with The Associated Press during campaigning that cleaning up the capital and planting trees would be her first priority.
She also said that the female candidates put forth by her party constitute a “message aimed at reassuring the women of my country” that advances made by women in the North African nation would not be compromised by her party.
Tunisia has been the most advanced among Arab nations regarding women’s rights since gaining independence from France in 1956, with its first president Habib Bourguiba enshrining some principles of equality of men and women in the constitution.

The foot bones of a toddler who died 3 million years ago show that baby pre-humans could both walk upright like modern humans and scamper up trees like apes, researchers said Wednesday.
The thumb-sized fossils come from a skeleton discovered in Dikika, Ethiopia, in 2002 and they have delivered priceless insights into how modern humans evolved from our distant ancestors, the researchers said.
“To have a fossil this complete, and to have the fossil of a child, gives us a brand-new window into of what it was like 3 million years ago,” said Jeremy DeSilva, a paleontologist at Dartmouth University whose team examined the tiny foot bones.
“Skeletons are rare and skeletons of kids are even rarer.”

Different teams of experts have looked at various parts of the precious fossil skeleton, which belonged to an Australopithecus afarensis that would have been about 2 ½ years old when she died.
It took years to remove the foot bones from the sandstone it was embedded in, DeSilva told NBC News.
“This is done grain by grain under the microscope,” he said.
More like apes or more like humans?
The bones have been dated to about 3.3 million years ago and identified as the same species as “Lucy”, the most famous example of an Australopithecus. The toddler bones date to about 200,000 years earlier than Lucy’s, however.
DeSilva’s analysis of the foot shows that baby Australopithecines had features that were similar to both modern humans and modern apes, he reports in the journal Science Advances.
“This is a very humanlike foot,” he said. “What is curious is it still retains some apelike features. The toes are slightly curved and longer than a modern human’s.”
To DeSilva, this suggests that juvenile Australopithecines clung to their parents much as baby apes do today, and probably could climb trees quickly.
Paleontologists who study Australopithecus argue about whether they were more like apes or more like modern humans.
“Our field has been divided into two camps, with one group saying Lucy and her kind … still climbed trees … and maybe that means they didn’t walk as well as we do today,” DeSilva said.
“There is another group that says, ‘Look at these bones. They did walk as we do and these apelike features are just an echo of the past from when their ancestors were still in the trees.'”
That’s because, in part, the bones of adult Australopithecus have a heavy heel, made for slamming into the ground, just like modern humans have.
But the baby foot doesn’t have such a heavy heel.

“What this baby’s foot allows us to do is introduce a third possibility,” DeSilva said.
“That is that the adults were very good walkers, but it is the kids that are climbing up into those trees,” he added.
That could be for play, just as modern children clamber all over the monkey bars while their parents stay on the ground.
“But you also don’t see leopards roaming around playgrounds,” DeSilva pointed out. “Three million years ago, this environment was filled with predators.”
“If you were living in Africa 3 million years ago without fire, without structures and without any means of defense, you’d better be able get up in a tree when the sun goes down.”
Also, having infants and toddlers that could hold on tight, without having to be carried, would make it much easier for the parents to move around. “Another thing they didn’t have 3 million years ago was strollers,” DeSilva said.
Modern human babies are born with feet already made for walking, but Australopithecus could have developed strong walking feet in another way, DeSilva said — by using them that way.
“Bones are living tissues. They grow and respond and they change shape depending on what you do to them,” he said. “Even though humans and Lucy’s kind as adults have chunky heels, we developed them in completely different ways. We would never have known that without this fossil.”
DeSilva, who has twins who were themselves toddlers when he started studying the fossil, says he feels a special attachment to it.
“This was a toddler who died and it’s really hard to think about when you have your own toddlers,” he said. “And yet it is giving us this absolutely extraordinary amount of information about our past and about why we are the way we are today.”",www.41nbc.com,2018-07-18 00:00:00,34,50565

WARSAW, Poland — Anti-government protesters rallied in front of Poland’s Supreme Court in Warsaw on Wednesday to show support for the court’s president, who is being forced to retire under a judicial overhaul.
The hundreds of people who gathered sang the national anthem and chanted “Judges are not removable!” and “Constitution!” as the court’s First President Malgorzata Gersdorf showed up for work, saying that according to the constitution, her six-year term runs through 2020.
Gersdorf, 65, thanked the crowd and said she was acting to protect Poland’s constitution. It was not immediately clear whether she would be allowed back into her office on the first day of her forced retirement.
Protests started this week against the new law, mandated by the right-wing ruling party, that cuts the retirement age to 65 from 70 for Poland’s Supreme Court justices.
Under the new rules, Gersdorf should have asked President Andrzej Duda for an extension of her mandate if she was to be of retirement age on July 4. She has not done so.
“That would mean subordination,” Gersdorf said. “And I cannot agree to this because I need to fulfill what I swore I would.”

The law, which took effect Tuesday, is forcing the chief justice and as many as one-third of the court’s 72 sitting judges to step down. It is seen as the ruling Law and Justice party’s clampdown on the top court.
The Supreme Court shake-up represents the culmination of a comprehensive overhaul of Poland’s justice system that gives the ruling party new powers over the courts.
Critics at home and abroad accuse the Law and Justice party of seeking control over courts for political gain, and say its policies, which also include tighter control of public media, amount to a shift towards authoritarian rule.
European Union officials and international human rights groups have expressed alarm, alleging the moves represent an erosion of judicial independence that violates Western standards. The European Commission, which polices compliance with E.U. laws, opened an infringement procedure Monday against Poland over the Supreme Court law.
The Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal for criminal and civil cases in Poland. Its justices also rule on the validity of elections.
The government insists it is improving Poland’s justice system, saying it was inefficient and controlled by an untouchable “caste” of judges. It argues that putting judges under the control of the legislative and executive branches will makes the courts answerable to the voters, and thus more democratic.
The ruling Law and Justice party’s standing in polls has held steady at around 40 percent throughout the dispute, well above any single rival party.
It rejects criticism, saying E.U. treaties do not give Brussels institutions the power to influence national matters such as the judiciary.",www.41nbc.com,2018-07-18 00:00:00,24,50567
"Hong Kong’s top court ruled on Wednesday that a British lesbian should be granted a spousal visa in a landmark judgment that could open the door for expatriate same-sex partners to move to the Chinese-ruled city.
The British woman, who requested to be identified only as QT in court, sued the director of immigration in 2014 after she was denied a spousal visa that would have granted her resident status and allowed her to work without the need for a separate visa.

The woman and her partner, a dual British and South African national identified only as SS and who was offered work in Hong Kong, had entered into a civil partnership in Britain. QT did not appear in court.
“Although I cannot be with you in person today, that does not diminish the joy I feel, knowing that Hong Kong’s highest court has upheld my right, as a lesbian woman, to be treated equally by the Hong Kong government,” QT said in a statement.
She plans to live in Hong Kong, instead of flying back and forth to Britain as she has been doing for years.
“I won’t feel like a second citizen anymore and I can have the basic rights like anyone else, from as simple as having a library card to having healthcare,” she told reporters by phone.
The unanimous ruling by five judges, upholding a lower court’s decision, brings to an end the case involving rights for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, which won support from more than 30 global banks and law firms, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
“This ruling strengthens Hong Kong’s ability to attract global talent and its competitiveness as Asia’s pre-eminent global center for commerce,” the companies said in a statement.
The decision goes beyond immigration and effectively recognizes the rights of local and foreign same-sex couples who legally entered civil partnerships abroad, said the British woman’s lawyer, Michael Vidler.
“We never argued this case is about same-sex marriage for Hong Kong, but we hope this case will pave the way for exactly that,” he said outside the Court of Final Appeal.
Hong Kong’s Immigration Department said it respected the ruling.
“We are studying the judgment carefully and shall seek legal advice as necessary before deciding the way forward,” it said.
“SHAKY FOUNDATIONS”
Hong Kong could become the first Asian jurisdiction to officially grant dependent visas to same-sex partners, even though it already makes some exceptions to diplomats.
Foreign diplomats in mainland China also say the Chinese government has been issuing de facto spousal visas to same-sex partners in recent years.
Although Taiwan set a precedent in Asia last year when its constitutional court ruled that same-sex couples have the right to legally marry, gay marriage has not been legalized yet.
An official website stated that same-sex spouses do not qualify as spouses for immigration purposes.
Japan does not officially grant dependent visas to same-sex couples, but some married foreign couples say they managed to get one.
Hong Kong is a popular destination for expatriates, many of whom work in the city’s financial services and legal sectors.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1991, although marriage is legally defined as a monogamous union between a man and a woman. It does not recognize same-sex marriage.
There is no law against sexual discrimination in the territory which is governed under a “one country, two systems” formula that promises it a high degree of autonomy, a legal system separate from that of mainland China and an independent judiciary.
In a 45-page judgment, the judges said the director of immigration’s assertion that an obvious difference existed between marriage and a civil partnership rested on “shaky foundations”.
The court also said that while the director of immigration’s policy aimed to attract foreign talent, the act of rejecting same-sex partners was counter-productive.
It had not allowed the 31 global banks and law firms’ to join in the court case, but acknowledged their effort in the judgment.
“As is evident from the attempted intervention of the banks and law firms, the ability to bring in dependants is an important issue for persons deciding whether to move to Hong Kong,” it said.
Veteran LGBTQ activist Billy Leung, who arrived at court with a small rainbow flag, said he knew at least six same-sex couples who had chosen not to move to Hong Kong or had left the city in the past five years over what they described as a lack of LGBTQ-friendly policies.
“The struggle is real,” he said.

"The remains of 13 Chinese men who came to Nevada in the 1800s were reburied Tuesday after being exhumed more than two decades ago for archaeological study.
It’s the end of more than 21 years of waiting for Lijuchin “Lee” Chin, a restaurant owner in Carlin, Nevada, who has been involved in the case since a property owner in the city found the remains in his backyard in November 1996.

Chin’s customers came to her then and said she had to go see what was happening after the remains were found. When she made it to the scene, archaeologists were already investigating, Chin recalled.
It turned out that the property was a forgotten Chinese cemetery, according to Professor Emerita Sue Fawn Chung of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who assisted in researching the identities of the men. The 13 were a small fraction of the thousands of Chinese immigrants who migrated to the American West to work in gold mines starting in 1848. Some settled in Carlin after the gold rush.
“In 1868 the Central Pacific Railroad went through Carlin and some of the Chinese found a place in the desert with a natural spring to grow produce,” Chung said.
While there were many Chinese in the city during the late 1800s, according to Margaret Johnston, a member of the city council, very few remain today in the city of about 2,400. The 2010 U.S. Census counted just three people of Chinese descent in the city that year.
While the discovery was exciting for the archaeologists, Chin wanted to make sure the bodies were handled properly.
“I told the professor at the site that when you finish all this research, please rebury them and they said ‘Oh yeah, we will do it,’” Chin said.
I’ve waited for this day too long. I can’t believe it. I am so happy that they can finally come home. This is their home.
Johnston, a member of the Carlin city council, said the research project was initially only supposed to take 6 months to a year.
The remains were originally sent to the Nevada State Museum, according to The Associated Press and Elko Daily Free Press, and were eventually transferred to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas anthropology department.
They were studied by scientists from the Smithsonian, a group from National Geographic, and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas graduate students, according to Chung.
The research led to the detailing of Chinese burial practices: The caskets contained personal items like tobacco pipes, opium pipes, eyeglasses, and coins to be used in the afterlife, according to Chung.
“Research takes a long time and once the studies were done, UNLV Anthropology Department had to have Carlin agree to take back the remains for reburial in the Carlin public cemetery as part of the original agreement,” she said.
Chin said she reached out to Johnston about four or five months ago to help retrieve the remains.
“We just did everything right. We talked to the funeral home. We found out what kind of permitting we needed,” Johnston said. “It was a long tedious process because people don’t do that every day.”
Local residents helped prepare the remains for reburial, building and painting 13 caskets, Chin said. More than $600 worth of materials were donated by a local Home Depot and a local resident, she added.
Chin and her husband organized the ceremony, incorporating Chinese burial traditions, including incense burning and fresh flower arrangements as well as a meal for the attendees.
“I’ve waited for this day too long. I can’t believe it. I am so happy that they can finally come home. This is their home,” Chin said. “I’m not going to let anybody touch them again.”

"Then in September, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, Trump discussed it again, this time at greater length, in a private dinner with leaders from four Latin American allies that included Santos, the same three people said and Politico reported in February.
The U.S. official said Trump was specifically briefed not to raise the issue and told it wouldn’t play well, but the first thing the president said at the dinner was, “My staff told me not to say this.” Trump then went around asking each leader if they were sure they didn’t want a military solution, according to the official, who added that each leader told Trump in clear terms they were sure.

Eventually, McMaster would pull aside the president and walk him through the dangers of an invasion, the official said.
Taken together, the behind-the-scenes talks, the extent and details of which have not been previously reported, highlight how Venezuela’s political and economic crisis has received top attention under Trump in a way that was unimaginable in the Obama administration. But critics say it also underscores how his “America First” foreign policy at times can seem outright reckless, providing ammunition to America’s adversaries.
The White House declined to comment on the private conversations. But a National Security Council spokesman reiterated that the U.S. will consider all options at its disposal to help restore Venezuela’s democracy and bring stability. Under Trump’s leadership, the U.S., Canada and European Union have levied sanctions on dozens of top Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, over allegations of corruption, drug trafficking and human rights abuses. The U.S. has also distributed more than $30 million to help Venezuela’s neighbors absorb an influx of more than 1 million migrants who have fled the country.
For Maduro, who has long claimed that the U.S. has military designs on Venezuela and its vast oil reserves, Trump’s bellicose talk provided the unpopular leader with an immediate if short-lived boost as he was trying to escape blame for widespread food shortages and hyperinflation. Within days of the president’s talk of a military option, Maduro filled the streets of Caracas with loyalists to condemn “Emperor” Trump’s belligerence, ordered up nationwide military exercises and threatened with arrest opponents he said were plotting his overthrow with the U.S.
“Mind your own business and solve your own problems, Mr. Trump!” thundered Nicolas Maduro, the president’s son, at the government-stacked constituent assembly. “If Venezuela were attacked, the rifles will arrive in New York, Mr. Trump,” the younger Maduro said. “We will take the White House.”
Even some of the staunchest U.S. allies were begrudgingly forced to side with Maduro in condemning Trump’s saber rattling. Santos, a big backer of U.S. attempts to isolate Maduro, said an invasion would have zero support in the region. The Mercosur trade bloc, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying “the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy” and repudiating “any option that implies the use of force.”
But among Venezuela’s beleaguered opposition movement, hostility to the idea of a military intervention has slowly eased.
A few weeks after Trump’s public comments, Harvard economics professor Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister, wrote a syndicated column titled “D Day Venezuela,” in which he called for a “coalition of the willing” made up of regional powers and the U.S. to step in and support militarily a government appointed by the opposition-led national assembly.
Mark Feierstein, who oversaw Latin America on the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said that strident U.S. action on Venezuela, however commendable, won’t loosen Maduro’s grip on power if it’s not accompanied by pressure from the streets. However, he thinks Venezuelans have largely been demoralized after a crackdown on protests last year triggered dozens of deaths, and the threat of more repression has forced dozens of opposition leaders into exile.
“People inside and outside the administration know they can ignore plenty of what Trump says,” Feierstein, who is now a senior adviser at the Albright Stonebridge Group, said of Trump’s talk of military invasion of Venezuela. “The concern is that it raised expectations among Venezuelans, many of whom are waiting for an external actor to save them.”",www.41nbc.com,2018-07-18 00:00:00,20,50492

They wanted his brother to hear his screams after each lash, Bitcha said. The torture continued until his brother could pay his ransom in full, he said.
No wonder his brother was overjoyed when Bitcha called him from the Open Arms on a phone he borrowed from a crew member.

"(CNN) — A nationwide manhunt is underway for three men accused of kidnapping and raping two sisters, ages 13 and 14, in northern Ohio, Bowling Green police said.
One suspect, David Ramos Contreras, 27, of Mexico, was spotted Saturday with two women in a lightly colored vehicle at a Walmart in Holland, Ohio, said police, who are asking for the public’s help in their pursuit of the suspects.
All three men are classified as dangerous, police said. It’s not clear whether they’re traveling together.
Nationwide warrants were issued for Contreras, Juan Garcia Rios Adiel and Arnulfo Ramos after an alleged incident last week at a Days Inn motel in Bowling Green, Deputy Chief Justin White said Tuesday in a statement.
The sisters were staying at the hotel with their parents when four men held them for a time against their will, White said. Later, the girls’ mother took them to be examined at a local hospital, he said.
Police learned of the incident around 11 p.m. on June 28, Lt. Dan Mancuso told CNN on Wednesday, adding he was unsure of the date of the alleged attack.
One suspect, Simon Juan Thomas, 24, of Guatemala, was arrested the next day, and charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, a misdemeanor, jail records show. He was being held by the Wood County, Ohio sheriff on $50,000 bond.
Police believe the men had stayed at the Days Inn for about a week before the alleged crimes, they said.
All four suspects were found to have “fraudulent paperwork” documenting their status as immigrant workers, White said.
Police said Adiel possessed a U.S. Permanent Resident ID card out of Fellsmere, Florida with a listed date of birth as 9/13/98. However, the card was later verified to be fraudulent.
“We are investigating an alleged sexual assault, not their immigration status,” White told CNN affiliate WTVG.
The US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency is also involved in the manhunt, Bowling Green police said.

"AMESBURY, England (AP) — British police say two Britons who fell critically ill in the town of Amesbury were exposed to nerve agent Novichok, the same material used to poison a former Russian spy in a nearby area last spring.
Medical officials said Wednesday people who had been in the area where the couple had been should take precautions and wash their clothes.
Police said it is unclear if this incident is linked to the earlier poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, or if the batch was the same as the one that poisoned them on March 4.
Counter-terrorism police detective Neil Basu said it is unclear if the couple were targeted or if the poisoning was accidental.

"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Law enforcement authorities in South Florida want to talk to a 22-year-old man wanted as a “person of interest” in the shooting death of rising rap star XXXTentacion.
Broward Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Veda Coleman-Wright said in a news release sent Tuesday night that detectives want to ask Robert Allen what he knows about the rapper’s death. She says he’s also wanted on a felony warrant for violating probation for possession of flakka and carrying a concealed weapon.
XXXTentacion, whose real name is Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, was shot June 18. Detectives said a SUV blocked the 20-year-old rapper’s luxury sports car in the driveway of a Fort Lauderdale-area motorcycle dealership and two masked men confronted him during an apparent robbery attempt.
Twenty-two-year-old Dedrick Williams faces murder charges. He hasn’t entered a plea.

"KEY BISCAYNE, FLA. (WSVN) - As America celebrates Independence Day, South Florida residents are taking to the streets for barbecues, parades and parties.
Locals gathered in Key Biscayne for the 56th annual Independence Day Parade.
Grammy Award-winning singer Jon Secada was on hand to sing the national anthem
“It’s my first time, in all these years living in Miami,” Secada said. “This is what Miami’s all about, Key Biscayne and a day like this.”
Some attendees have been coming to the event for years.
“It’s always the best on Key Biscayne,” said Annika Akernund Tarajano. “I’ve lived here close to 40 years and I really, really love it. It’s a wonderful day.”
“I think this is awesome. I wanted to come last year, but I’m really, really looking forward to the fireworks at night,” said attendee Donte Harris.
In Broward, residents also came out to enjoy Independence Day activities.
In Fort Lauderdale, a host of events are taking place, including live music, parties, giveaways, contests and more. The celebration was put together by Fort Lauderdale Parks and Recreation.
Fort Lauderdale also kicked off the day with a parade along the beach, one of the city’s oldest traditions.
“It’s a day full of lots of fun and excitement. It’s all free as far as the activities,” said Debbie Bylica of Fort Lauderdale Parks and Recreation. “You can bring your coolers and your food. Every year, the crowd gets bigger. By the time the fireworks, the beach is packed from the north end all the way down to where it splits to the south beach, so it’s packed. It’s hard to tell, but thousands of people are here.”
Organizers said parking for the Fort Lauderdale event is scarce, so it is recommended that attendees park downtown. City lots will only cost $5 and a shuttle at the Briny Riverfront Pub, located at 305 S. Andrews Avenue, will drop you off at the event.
Both events in Key Biscayne and Fort Lauderdale will all culminate in a fireworks show at the end of the day.

"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Three suspects were charged Tuesday with kidnapping two people from a Los Angeles home and holding one of them naked in a bathtub for 30 hours while demanding the other pay a $10,000 ransom, prosecutors said.
Keith Andre Stewart, Johntae Jones and Amber Neal were charged with kidnapping, assault with a firearm and other offense in connection with the May 3 incident. It was not immediately clear whether they had attorneys who could comment on the allegations
Neal’s arrest at gunpoint by Los Angeles police officers on Monday was captured on video by a bystander and had been viewed more than 2.4 million times on Twitter. It wasn’t immediately known when the others were taken into custody.
Prosecutors allege the trio went to Daisy McCrackin’s home in South Los Angeles on May 3, where they say Stewart pistol-whipped a man who was in the home, Joseph Capone. The three then placed bags over the two victims’ heads and drove them several miles to Jones’ home in Compton, prosecutors said.
Once they were at Jones’ home, the suspects forced Capone to strip naked and then held him in a bathtub for 30 hours without food, prosecutors allege.
Investigators said Jones and Neal then took McCrackin’s car and drove her to several different banks while demanding she pay $10,000 for Capone’s release.
Eventually she was forced to write a $10,000 check to Neal, prosecutors said.
The next day, they brought McCrackin — an actress who has appeared in several films including the horror flick Halloween: Resurrection — back to her home, where she escaped from them and called police, authorities said.
Jones and Neil were being held on $1 million each and Steward was being held on more than $2 million bail, according to prosecutors. If convicted, they each potentially face sentences of up to life in prison.

A person climbed the statue’s base on the Fourth of July shortly after several people were arrested after hanging a banner from the statue’s pedestal calling for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
News helicopter video showed the climber sitting Wednesday by the bottom of the statue’s robes, about 100 feet (30 meters) aboveground. Police nearby tried to persuade the climber to descend.
Earlier, National Park Service spokesman Jerry Willis said at least six people were taken into custody for the banner, which read “Abolish I.C.E.,” referring to part of the Department of Homeland Security.

National Park Service spokesman Jerry Willis says at least six people were taken into custody Wednesday. He says federal code of regulations prohibits hanging banners from the monument.
The large banner said “Abolish I.C.E.” ICE is a division of the Department of Homeland Security whose officers arrest and deport unauthorized immigrants inside the U.S., among other duties.
Activists with the group Rise and Resist say they hung the banner to protest U.S. immigration policy. They oppose President Donald Trump’s administration and advocate ending deportations and family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border.

I asked to meet my constituent who thought I was suspicious, but she was on the road by then. The officer called her, we talked and she did apologize.
(CNN) — A black Oregon state representative says someone called the police on her while she was canvassing door-to-door in her district.
Rep. Janelle Bynum represents District 51, which includes the area of Clackamas County, where she was campaigning.
In a Facebook post Tuesday, the Democrat wrote that a woman notified police that Bynum was suspicious because she was “spending a lot of time typing on my cell phone after each house.”
Bynum is running for reelection in the fall, and said she takes notes when she’s visiting her constituents to keep an account of what her community cares about.
She praised the deputy who responded for being professional, and said she asked him if she could meet the woman who made the call, but she was not available.
“The officer called her, we talked and she did apologize,” Bynum said, without specifying the race of the caller.
CNN has reached out to Bynum and the police department for comment. Bynum told local media that someone called 911 and reported that she was spending too much time at houses in the area.
In recent weeks, there have been a series of widely-publicized instances of police being called on black people engaging in regular activities. In one incident in Ohio, someone called the police on a 12-year-old boy for mowing the wrong lawn.

KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) — A Texas attorney has won a Key lime pie-eating contest in the Florida Keys where the tart, creamy dessert originated in the late 1800s.
Defending champion Trey Bergman of Houston consumed a 9-inch pie smothered with whipped cream in in a minute, 40.57 seconds Wednesday, immersing his face in it since competitors couldn’t use their hands.
A sweeter alternative to New York City’s July 4 hotdog-eating challenge, the contest drew 25 entrants and highlighted Key West’s annual Key Lime Festival.
Key lime pie was designated Florida’s official pie in 2006 by the state legislature. Ingredients are condensed milk, egg yolks and the juice of tiny yellow Key limes, typically with a graham cracker crust and a meringue topping.
Other festival events included a Key Lime Pie Drop and a pie-tasting stroll.

"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — As a meeting last August in the Oval Office to discuss sanctions on Venezuela was concluding, President Donald Trump turned to his top aides and asked an unsettling question: With a fast unraveling Venezuela threatening regional security, why can’t the U.S. just simply invade the troubled country?
The suggestion stunned those present at the meeting, including U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, both of whom have since left the administration. This account of the previously undisclosed conversation comes from a senior administration official familiar with what was said.
In an exchange that lasted around five minutes, McMaster and others took turns explaining to Trump how military action could backfire and risk losing hard-won support among Latin American governments to punish President Nicolas Maduro for taking Venezuela down the path of dictatorship, according to the official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions.
But Trump pushed back. Although he gave no indication he was about to order up military plans, he pointed to what he considered past cases of successful gunboat diplomacy in the region, according to the official, like the invasions of Panama and Grenada in the 1980s.
The idea, despite his aides’ best attempts to shoot it down, would nonetheless persist in the president’s head.
The next day, Aug. 11, Trump alarmed friends and foes alike with talk of a “military option” to remove Maduro from power. The public remarks were initially dismissed in U.S. policy circles as the sort of martial bluster people have come to expect from the reality TV star turned commander in chief.
But shortly afterward, he raised the issue with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, according to the U.S. official. Two high-ranking Colombian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid antagonizing Trump confirmed the report.
Then in September, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, Trump discussed it again, this time at greater length, in a private dinner with leaders from four Latin American allies that included Santos, the same three people said and Politico reported in February.
The U.S. official said Trump was specifically briefed not to raise the issue and told it wouldn’t play well, but the first thing the president said at the dinner was, “My staff told me not to say this.” Trump then went around asking each leader if they were sure they didn’t want a military solution, according to the official, who added that each leader told Trump in clear terms they were sure.
Eventually, McMaster would pull aside the president and walk him through the dangers of an invasion, the official said.
Taken together, the behind-the-scenes talks, the extent and details of which have not been previously reported, highlight how Venezuela’s political and economic crisis has received top attention under Trump in a way that was unimaginable in the Obama administration. But critics say it also underscores how his “America First” foreign policy at times can seem outright reckless, providing ammunition to America’s adversaries.
The White House declined to comment on the private conversations. But a National Security Council spokesman reiterated that the U.S. will consider all options at its disposal to help restore Venezuela’s democracy and bring stability. Under Trump’s leadership, the U.S., Canada and European Union have levied sanctions on dozens of top Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, over allegations of corruption, drug trafficking and human rights abuses. The U.S. has also distributed more than $30 million to help Venezuela’s neighbors absorb an influx of more than 1 million migrants who have fled the country.
For Maduro, who has long claimed that the U.S. has military designs on Venezuela and its vast oil reserves, Trump’s bellicose talk provided the unpopular leader with an immediate if short-lived boost as he was trying to escape blame for widespread food shortages and hyperinflation. Within days of the president’s talk of a military option, Maduro filled the streets of Caracas with loyalists to condemn “Emperor” Trump’s belligerence, ordered up nationwide military exercises and threatened with arrest opponents he said were plotting his overthrow with the U.S.
“Mind your own business and solve your own problems, Mr. Trump!” thundered Nicolas Maduro, the president’s son, at the government-stacked constituent assembly. “If Venezuela were attacked, the rifles will arrive in New York, Mr. Trump,” the younger Maduro said. “We will take the White House.”
Even some of the staunchest U.S. allies were begrudgingly forced to side with Maduro in condemning Trump’s saber rattling. Santos, a big backer of U.S. attempts to isolate Maduro, said an invasion would have zero support in the region. The Mercosur trade bloc, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying “the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy” and repudiating “any option that implies the use of force.”
But among Venezuela’s beleaguered opposition movement, hostility to the idea of a military intervention has slowly eased.
A few weeks after Trump’s public comments, Harvard economics professor Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister, wrote a syndicated column titled “D Day Venezuela,” in which he called for a “coalition of the willing” made up of regional powers and the U.S. to step in and support militarily a government appointed by the opposition-led national assembly.
Mark Feierstein, who oversaw Latin America on the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said that strident U.S. action on Venezuela, however commendable, won’t loosen Maduro’s grip on power if it’s not accompanied by pressure from the streets. However, he thinks Venezuelans have largely been demoralized after a crackdown on protests last year triggered dozens of deaths, and the threat of more repression has forced dozens of opposition leaders into exile.
“People inside and outside the administration know they can ignore plenty of what Trump says,” Feierstein, who is now a senior adviser at the Albright Stonebridge Group, said of Trump’s talk of military invasion of Venezuela. “The concern is that it raised expectations among Venezuelans, many of whom are waiting for an external actor to save them.”

"BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Little Ruya Kadir had sparkling eyes, a few basic belongings and not much else when she arrived in Boise, Idaho more than two years ago.
But at just six months old, she had the most important thing: A mother who loved her so fiercely that she left behind her homeland, her husband and everything she knew so Ruya would grow up in a safe place.
Ruya was at her third birthday party — complete with a pink doll-shaped cake and a Disney princess banner — Saturday evening when a man armed with a large knife attacked. Ruya and five other children were badly injured, along with the three adults who tried to protect them.
Timmy Kinner, a 30-year-old homeless man who had briefly been a guest at the apartment complex where Ruya lived, has been charged with first-degree murder and several other felonies in connection with the attack.
And Ruya’s mother Bifituu Kadir is mourning her little girl, slain in the very community that was supposed to keep her safe.
Police say Kinner had recently been asked to leave the apartment complex because of bad behavior. They say the attack does not appear to be a hate crime.
“I remember Ruya when she was just a little bundle in my arms,” said Megan Schwab, an employment specialist with the International Rescue Committee who befriended Bifituu and Ruya when they first arrived in Boise as Ethiopian refugees in December 2015.
“It was a very long journey, not something she talks about a lot but I do know she was fleeing violence,” Schwab said. “She was alone with her little baby and very strong … she had a lot of resolve to protect her baby and create a new life for them.”
From the very first meeting, Bifituu and Schwab would pass baby Ruya back and forth as they filled out job applications and other paperwork aimed at getting the Kadir family properly settled in. When Schwab realized Bifituu had virtually no baby gear in her one-bedroom apartment, she found them hand-me-down furnishings and clothes.
Bifituu’s home was “always a monument to Ruya,” full of things the child loved, Schwab said.
“She loved shopping and dressing up very fashionably just like her mother,” she said. “Disney princesses were her favorite, and anything at all that was pink.”
Schwab saw Ruya just a month before the party, and was struck by how much she had grown. No longer toddling, Ruya flitted through the room where Schwab and Bifituu were talking. She stopped a moment, fixed her big, long-lashed eyes on Schwab and smiled. Then she dashed off in a game of chase with neighborhood kids.
On Monday morning, Schwab saw Ruya and Bifituu again, this time in a Salt Lake City hospital. She and other close friends were there to say goodbye to their sparkling little girl.
“I will say I was very privileged to be able to be there,” Schwab said, her eyes filling with tears. “Her mom is very strong and … the community really surrounded her to help her move through those last moments and help her begin the stages of grief.”
One other child injured in the attack has since been released from the hospital, but some of the remaining seven victims face long roads to recovery, said Julianne Donnelly Tzul, the executive director of the IRC of Boise. All of the injured were refugees from Ethiopia, Syria and Iraq.
“I can’t identify who got what,” Donnelly Tzul said. “But there are slashes to faces requiring surgery and reconstructive surgery. There is at least one spinal injury that might cause paralysis to some degree, and lots of stab and puncture wounds.”
Many have reached out to help, including Boise’s Muslim community and other religious and social groups. But a crime as horrific as this one means the refugee families will have needs that stretch into the coming years, not just the next few weeks, Donnelly Tzul said.
Some of the injured do not have health insurance, and some of the others require medical care that isn’t covered. They will also need counseling and many are losing work time, making it hard to cover basic living expenses. And some will need to find new places to live for their own mental health, said Donnelly Tzul, and so will need help with relocation expenses such as first months’ rent and a deposit.
The International Rescue Committee has launched an online fundraiser for those looking to help.
With luck, Bifituu’s husband will be able to join her in Boise. The IRC is working with immigration services and government officials to try to get him to the U.S.
“Arrangements have been made to bring Ruya back to Boise,” Schwab said, “so that her mom can still be with her baby here.”

"BOSTON (AP) — The USS Constitution has sailed in Boston Harbor and fired her guns again to mark Independence Day.
The world’s oldest commissioned warship still afloat left its berth at the Charlestown Navy Yard Wednesday morning and glided through the harbor to mark 242 years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
The ship nicknamed “Old Ironsides” traveled to Fort Independence on Castle Island to fire a 21-gun salute. The ship’s commander saluted the crowds gathered there.
A Navy sailor on board recited the Declaration of Independence during the cruise.
An additional 17-gun salute was fired as the Constitution passed the U.S. Coast Guard Station on its way back to the Charlestown Navy Yard. The station is the former site of the shipyard where the vessel was built in 1797.

"BOSTON (WHDH) - Boston Pops conductor Keith Lockhart spoke with 7News as he got ready for his 24th Fourth of July Performance.
Rhiannon Giddens warmed up on stage at the Hatch Shell Tuesday while Lockhart listened and checked in with her, clearly loving what he hears.
He says the show never gets old, despite conducting it for over two decades.
Lockhart does have some advice for his younger self, who joined the Boston Pops in 1995.
“I’d tell that 35-year-old kid who got up on the podium in 1995 that, you know, don’t worry so much. Don’t stress out. It’s going to be fine,” he said.
The Independence Day maestro has had several memorable moments over the years.
“The time the entire audience was evacuated to the tunnels on Storrow Drive because of impending severe weather,” Lockhart recalled. “The time we went on during the rainstorm in 1996 and everything was going great. Everytime that we went to break, finished the piece, the crew would come out with towels and wipe the stage off.”
Some of his favorite guest performers included Steven Tyler and Joey Kramer from Aerosmith. He added that he would love to see Bruce Springsteen out on the stage.

Captain Charles Rouse, a member of the Massachusetts Army National Guard, is one of the people making sure everything’s ready for the show.
“To be a part of this is a pretty cool thing,” Rouse said. “Been here my entire life and I’ve never been a part of this…it’s a cool thing to be a part of.”

“I read history books, I know Boston, I know Massachusetts,” he said. “It’s the birthplace of America…I think it’s great. I’d rather be nowhere else right now.”
The cannons, which are from the 1950s, used to be able to fire up to 5 miles. Now the cannons are GPS-guided and can pinpoint a target up to 20 miles away.

"BOSTON (WHDH) - For many of the thousands of people who gather in the Esplanade to take in the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular, the celebration is an annual family tradition.
That’s certainly the case for the Holder family, who say they show up early every year to score seats for the big show.
“We came here and we loved it ever since,” a member of the family told 7News at the Esplanade Wednesday. “We go out and we mingle with other people. We break out dominoes. Other families come over and play with us.”
For others, like Richard Hunnewell, who is visiting Boston from Georgia, this year’s performance will be their first.
“It’s great,” Hunnewell said. “This has been a bucket list item for a long time.”

"BOSTON (WHDH) - Lines are already forming as people gather to get through security and secure their spot at the Hatch Shell ahead of the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular.
People showing up early say screening was quick, and they’re grateful for the tight security.
“It’s a shame that it has to happen, but we don’t mind doing it,” said one spectator.
Police with dogs swept the area, where performers like Rachel Platten will be entertaining the crowds tonight.
Divers are in the water, the State Police Air Wing is above, and large trucks and barriers surround the Hatch Shell, even blocking nearby roads.
The FBI has a bomb squad on site, and state, local, and federal agencies say they’re all sharing information.
Massachusetts state police say so far, it’s been smooth.
“The crowd is being very cooperative,” said state police incident commander Rick Ball.
State police say screening is quick when people listen to what they shouldn’t bring in.
“Nobody’s coming in with big coolers or bags or backpacks or cans or the things we prohibit,” Ball said, “so that makes the screening easier and we can move people through faster.”
Police say to leave alcohol, backpacks, weapons, grills, and other prohibited items at home and take safety precautions — stay hydrated and wear sunscreen.

"DENVER (AP) — A growing wildfire destroyed more than 100 homes in the Colorado mountains, while other blazes across the parched U.S. West kept hundreds of other homes under evacuation orders and derailed holiday plans.
Authorities announced late Monday that a fire near Fort Garland, about 205 miles (330 kilometers) southwest of Denver, had destroyed 104 homes in a mountain housing development started by multimillionaire publisher Malcolm Forbes in the 1970s. The damage toll could rise because the burn area is still being surveyed.
Tamara Estes’ family cabin, which her parents had built in 1963 using wood and rocks from the land, was among the homes destroyed.
“I think it’s sinking in more now. But we’re just crying,” she said. “My grandmother’s antique dining table and her hutch are gone.”
“It was a sacred place to us,” she added.
Andy and Robyn Kuehler watched flames approach their cabin via surveillance video from their primary residence in Nebraska.
“We just got confirmation last night that the house was completely gone. It’s … a very sickening feeling watching the fire coming towards the house,” the couple wrote in an email Tuesday.
The blaze, labeled the Spring Fire, is one of six large wildfires burning in Colorado and is the largest at 123 square miles (318 square kilometers) — about five times the size of Manhattan. While investigators believe it was started by a spark from a fire pit, other fires, like one that began burning in wilderness near Fairplay, were started by lightning.
Nearly 60 large, active blazes are burning across the West, including nine in New Mexico and six each in Utah and California, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.
In Utah, authorities have evacuated 200 to 300 homes because of a growing wildfire near a popular fishing reservoir southeast of Salt Lake City amid hot temperatures and high winds. Several structures have been lost since the fire started Sunday, but it’s unclear how many, said Jason Curry of the Utah Division of Forest, Fire and State Lands.
Darren Lewis and his extended family planned to spend the Fourth of July at a cabin built nearly 50 years ago by his father and uncle in a wilderness area nestled between canyons and near a mountain river.
Instead, Lewis and his family will spend the holiday nervously waiting to hear if a half-century of family memories go up in smoke because of the fire, which has grown to 47 square miles (122 square kilometers).
“There’s a lot of history and memories that go into this cabin,” said Lewis, 44, of Magna, Utah. “The cabin we could rebuild, but the trees that we love would be gone. We’re just hoping that the wind blows the other way.”
Meanwhile, a wind-fueled wildfire in Northern California that continues to send a thick layer of smoke and ash south of San Francisco was threatening more than 900 buildings.
The massive blaze was choking skies with ash and smoke, prompting some officials to cancel Fourth of July fireworks shows and urge people to stay indoors to protect themselves from the unhealthy air.
At least 2,500 people have been told to evacuate as the so-called County Fire continues to spread, said Anthony Brown, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Brown said the blaze, which started Saturday and is surging through rugged terrain northwest of Sacramento, has grown to 113 square miles (294 square kilometers) amid hot and dry weather expected throughout the day. It was 15 percent contained Tuesday.
“The weather is better than what we had over the weekend. But it’s still hampering our efforts and it’s an area of concern,” he said.
So far this year, wildfires have burned 4,200 square miles in the United States, according to the fire center. That’s a bit below last year’s acreage to date — which included the beginning of California’s devastating fire season — but above the 10-year average of 3,600 square miles.
Because of the Independence Day holiday, authorities are also concerned about the possibility of campfires or fireworks starting new fires because of the dry, hot conditions. In Colorado, many communities have canceled firework displays, and a number of federal public lands and counties have some degree of fire restrictions in place, banning things like campfires or smoking outdoors.
In Arizona, large swaths of national forests and state trust land have been closed since before Memorial Day. Some cities have canceled fireworks displays because of extreme fire danger.
In New Mexico, all or part of three national forests remain closed because of the threat of wildfire, putting a damper on holiday camping plans. The forests that are open have strict rules, especially when it comes to fireworks.
“We’re just urging people to use extreme caution,” said Wendy Mason, a spokeswoman for the New Mexico State Forestry Division. “We want people to have fun and enjoy themselves, but we prefer they leave the fireworks shows to the professionals.”

"FOUNTAIN HILLS, Ariz. (AP) — A 92-year-old Arizona woman has been arrested and accused of fatally shooting her son who wanted to put her in an assisted living facility, authorities said Tuesday.
Anna Mae Blessing has been booked into jail on suspicion of one count each of first-degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and kidnapping, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office.
Blessing was in a wheelchair at her initial court appearance Tuesday where her bond was set at $500,000 and a lawyer was being appointed to represent her.
Sheriff’s officials said Blessing’s 72-year-old son was found dead Monday at his home in Fountain Hills, located about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Phoenix.
The man’s name wasn’t immediately released.
Blessing had been living with her son and his girlfriend for about six months, according to court records.
She told authorities that she argued with her son Monday morning over the way she was being treated and was upset with him stating that he was going to place her in assisted living.
Blessing told detectives she got out two handguns she has had since the 1970s — one bought at a gun store and the other obtained from her late husband.
She concealed two pistols in the pockets of her robe before confronting her son in his bedroom and firing multiple shots at him with one handgun, records show.
The gun was dislodged from Blessing’s hand after a struggle with her son’s girlfriend, as well as the second weapon, authorities said.
The unidentified woman called authorities and Blessing was located on a recliner in the home and taken into custody.

"MAE SAI, Thailand (AP) — Their skinny faces illuminated by a flashlight, the Thai soccer teammates stranded more than a week in a partly flooded cave said they were healthy on a video released Wednesday, as heavy rains forecast for later this week could complicate plans to safely extract them.
The 12 boys and their coach are seen sitting with Thai navy SEALs in the dark cave. The boys, many wrapped in foil warming blankets, take turns introducing themselves, folding their hands together in a traditional greeting and saying their names and that they are healthy.
The video lasting about a minute was recorded sometime Tuesday and was posted on the navy SEAL Facebook page Wednesday morning. The navy later released two more videos of the boys.
The boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach disappeared after they went exploring in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in northern Chiang Rai province after a soccer game June 23. The teammates, who were trapped inside when heavy rains flooded the cave, were found by rescue divers late Monday night during a desperate search that drew assistance from experts around the globe.
Authorities said the boys, who had also been shown Tuesday in a video shot by the British diver who discovered them, were being looked after by seven members of the Thai navy SEALs, including medics, who were staying with them inside the cave. They were mostly in stable condition and have received high-protein drinks.
In all of the videos the boys have appeared in good spirits. In the most recent videos a navy SEAL is shown treating minor cuts on the feet and legs of the boys with antibiotic ointment. Several of the boys are seen smiling as they interact with the navy SEAL, who cracks jokes.
Seeing the boys has boosted the mood of relatives, and officials are working to install an internet cable to the cave so that parents can talk to their children.
Kian Kamluang, whose 16-year-old son Pornchai is inside, said she had thought it was a 50 percent chance that her son would be found.
“It’s like he has been given a new life,” she said, adding that she’ll never let her son go into a cave or near water again.
SEAL commander Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yookongkaew said Tuesday that there was no rush to bring the group out of the cave, since they’re safe where they are. The current flooding situation means the boys would have to dive, which rescue experts have said could be extremely dangerous.
While efforts to pump out floodwaters are continuing, some Thai officials have indicated that heavy rains forecast for this weekend could force them to decide the boys should swim and dive out using the same complicated route of narrow passageways through which their rescuers entered.
Chiang Rai provincial Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said Wednesday that the boys have been practicing wearing diving masks and breathing, but he doesn’t believe they have attempted any practice dives.
He said it is unknown when an extraction could be attempted, but it is unlikely to be Wednesday.
“If it’s risky or not safe, we will not proceed yet,” Narongsak said. “It has to be 100 percent safe.”
Authorities said they were still exploring other options, such as scouring the mountainside for other ways into the cave and finding faster ways to pump water from the cave.
Cave rescue experts have said it could be safest to simply supply the boys where they are for now, and wait for the water to go down. That could take months, however, given that Thailand’s rainy season typically lasts through October.
The British Cave Rescue Council, which has members taking part in the operation , said in a statement that “although water levels have dropped, the diving conditions remain difficult and any attempt to dive the boys and their coach out will not be taken lightly because there are significant technical challenges and risks to consider.”
Gary Mitchell, the group’s assistant vice chairman, said getting out of the cave requires about a kilometer (half a mile) of diving total, though not all in one stretch, and takes about three hours.
“There’s air pockets along the way,” he said. “It’s confined spaces. It’s almost zero visibility. There’s currents to battle against in places as well. So it’s a really quite a strenuous environment to be in,” he said.

"NEW YORK (AP) — Several people who hung a banner calling for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement from the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal on the Fourth of July have been arrested, and authorities say a person is scaling the statue’s base.
National Park Service spokesman Jerry Willis says the climber was at the base beneath the statue’s foot Wednesday afternoon. Willis says police are atop the base, advising the climber to go down.
It’s unclear whether the climb is related to the earlier banner demonstration.
Willis says at least six people were taken into custody then. He says federal regulations prohibit hanging banners from the monument.
The banner said “Abolish I.C.E.,” referring to part of the Department of Homeland Security. ICE officers arrest and deport immigrants who are in the United States illegally, among other duties.

"SOMERVILLE, MASS. (WHDH) - Somerville convenience store owners are looking for justice after a masked man robbed their store with a gun Tuesday night.
Surveillance video caught the moments when the suspect walked into M&M Convenience on Main Street minutes before it closed around 10 p.m.
Co-owner Robin Yaqoob was behind the register when the suspect walked in and set his arm on the counter.
“I saw the gun,” she said. “I started shaking.”
The man then demanded money, telling Robin Yaqoob to hurry, she recalled.
Her husband and co-owner, Muhammad Yaqoob, of the store calmly walked over to the suspect as the incident unfolded.
“I look right at him and he pointed it like this,” he explained while stretching out his arm. “I told my wife, ‘just give him the money.'”
The Yaqoobs bought the store just three years ago and they say this is the third time their place has been robbed or broken into.
“Trying to make an honest, decent living but these guys come in here and rob us three times,” Muhammad Yaqoob said.
Two customers were also inside the store at the time of the robbery.

"The battle for baby Abi Branning takes centre stage in EastEnders next week when Rainie’s sham marriage to Max is threatened firstly by the arrival of her mum Cora Cross, who tries to convince her daughter to betray her ‘husband’, then by Rainie being tempted back to drugs.
Advertisement
As her relationship with Max grows increasingly complicated and her past demons return to haunt her, will Rainie renege on the arrangement to be paid to pose as Mrs Branning until the baby girl’s granddad is granted full custody? Tanya Franks, who plays Max’s mischievous missus, reveals what’s ahead for the toxic twosome and how little Abi’s future will be decided.
What is your take on Rainie’s allegiance with Max and trying to get baby Abi back?
It is a business arrangement they’ve both bought into. Historically Rainie and Max hate each other, however sometimes there are more similarities between two people than you realise. And they’re both disliked among the community so they both only really have each other – and that can throw up a mixture of feelings and confusions.
Does Rainie care about the bad things Max has done in the past?
You can’t change a person’s history. They are just focusing on getting Abi back, Rainie doesn’t think much about the bigger picture, she’s just throwing herself into this and will deal with the ramifications afterwards.
What pushes her into meeting with a drug dealer and almost relapsing?
Being in this environment which is family orientated makes her look at what she hasn’t necessarily achieved in her life. There is also a falling out with Donna, who really hits home with Rainie’s insecurities, so that hits a really raw nerve which is where we see her have weaker moments – as well her stronger moments, too.
Phil intervenes and stops her, is she grateful? And what is their relationship like now, given their history?
Phil is the one person that does and says the right thing for Rainie. If there is anyone that she can look into a mirror and face herself with it’s him. If he hadn’t have come along at that moment, Rainie might have gone down that road again – Phil certainly helps to keep her out of it, that’s for sure.
How does Rainie feel to see her mum Cora on the doorstep with Abi?
Shocked, and also put on the spot as Rainie hasn’t told anybody she is now living with Max. The fact Cora has the baby with her is enormous and allows Rainie and Max to explore what it would be like to look after Abi properly.
Does Rainie starting to have strong maternal feelings?
Yes, she wants to experience what it means to be a mum. It’s an opportunity for her that she never in a million years saw for herself, she didn’t ever feel that she would be in a situation where she’d be married and bringing up a child so it makes her question so much about herself as a potential mother.
Cora tries to tempt Rainie to sell out and betray Max, should we be questioning Rainie’s motives?
Absolutely. Rainie works on a very spontaneous level, you could make her an offer she couldn’t refuse and there is a good chance that she wouldn’t refuse it! However, with a baby is involved it makes her question where she feels her loyalties lay and what could be the best scenario for her in terms of being a part of this baby’s life…
Is bringing up baby Abi the salvation Rainie has been searching for?
Maybe, yes. If Cora was to give her an opportunity of a scenario where she really could be a mother then she might go that way, but if she can be more of a mother to Abi with Max, then maybe that is the way she will go. Right now that is the exploration for Rainie…

"Earlier, in February, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) released its plans and expectations for the development of a universal flu vaccine. (AP)
Just imagine that you get paid enormously for staying at a hotel for ten days. Isn’t it sounding something unbelievable? Well, this will be a reality soon as a research institution is paying $3,500 (Rs 2.4 lakh approx.) to a couple of ‘volunteers’ for a 10-day stay in a hotel. However, the condition is that the volunteers will let the scientists give them the flu. The research is all part of the University of St Louis’ effort to develop a universal vaccine.
The institution’s vaccine research department is opening a 24-room ‘Hotel Influenza’, where volunteers will be vaccinated and then exposed to viruses in a ‘human challenge’ study, reported Daily Mail. Among the flu strains that ‘guests’ might be exposed to is the H3N2 variation that killed many children and even young adults who can usually beat the flu in the US – including those that got vaccinated against the virus.
Signing up for the study will get you a 10-day stay in the hotel, which boasts such amenities as six leather recliners in front of a flat-screen TV, private bathrooms, internet and around-the-clock nursing staff. The researchers claim that their new facility is the perfect home-base for the development of a universal flu shot, which the US government says is a top public health priority, the report added.
Earlier, in February, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) released its plans and expectations for the development of a universal flu vaccine. Key to that plan is will be conducting ‘human challenge studies.’
Dr Daniel Hoft, director of St Louis University’s (SLU) Center for Vaccine Development said: “Human challenge studies are a way to get a lot of information quicker, with a smaller number of volunteers and less cost than a traditional vaccine study.”
Human challenge studies take the research model is to vaccinate people and then deliberately challenge their bodies by exposing them to flu to see if they get sick, Daily Mail report added.
According to the SLU press release, the volunteers for this kind of research typically get paid $3,500 ‘for their time and travel.’ The researchers there will give half of the participants a real experimental vaccine, and the other half will get a placebo.
Then, they will begin their stay at Hotel Influenza, spending 10 days quarantined in rooms with high-grade filtration systems, face masks instead of eye at SLU. For those who do not get sick, they will have an all-expenses-paid vacation in the company of nurses, and, if they are not shedding the virus they will be released to go home early.",www.financialexpress.com,2018-07-15 00:00:00,16,244713
"Coronation Street kicks off a hard-hitting homeless plot for Sean Tully next week when a run of bad luck sees the cobbles favourite finding himself forced to live rough after falling out with his friends, eventually ending up sleeping in a tent in a car park.

Fiz Stape has thrown out her lodger after getting fed up of him not paying his way, after the ex-Underworld machinist struggled to find a job having lied about being employed at a startup company in the city.
Seeking bed and board, the tenacious Tully has pity taken on him by former Rovers boss Liz McDonald, who agrees to let him sleep on her sofa. However, when Sean is then offered Liz’s old shifts at the pub by flailing landlady Toyah Battersby, his loyalty to Mrs Mac is forgotten.
Feeling betrayed by Sean, Liz chucks him out too and he desperately contacts everyone he knows looking for a place to stay but to no avail – stealing a tent from the bins outside the Kabin, he secretly bunks down for the night…
“This can happen to anyone,” says Antony Cotton, who plays Sean. “Earlier this year I got a random message on social media from a lad I had met a few times, he had become homeless and was asking for help. I thought all the classic things that everybody does – that all homeless people are on drugs or there’s something wrong with them. But I was thinking, ‘What could have possibly got them in this position?’
“He was living in a tent and I decided to help, I got in touch with the Manchester-based homeless charity Barnabus for advice and I booked him into a Travelodge for three nights and started the ball rolling to get things back on track. This man had lost everything,” continues Cotton. “He’d been robbed, had no front teeth where he’d been beaten up. No wonder people give up.”
When Cotton was told his character would be facing a similar plight, he was struck by the parallels. “Our assistant producer Tony Hammond told me Corrie would be doing a storyline about homelessness in the community and that Sean would be homeless and living in a tent – I couldn’t believe it.
“I put the research team in touch with Barnabus. It was weird as I had been doing the research without knowing. One of the scenes is Sean getting the tent out of a bush, where he’s hidden it. I knew that was accurate because this guy had done it too. Sean’s story is almost identical.”

"After eight months of development and seven months of testing its Urban Lab 2 vehicle, Renault Trucks has recorded a 12.8% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in urban and peri-urban environments, compared to a standard vehicle. This result was obtained by optimising aerodynamics, the drive train, tyres and vehicle-infrastructure communication.
Reducing the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of its vehicles remains a core concern for Renault Trucks. The EDIT (Efficient Distribution Truck), collaborative project was launched in 2016, involving Renault Trucks and six partners, namely Valeo, Lamberet, Michelin, BeNomad, INSA de Lyon (LamCoS) and IFSTTAR (LICIT). The aim of the project was to achieve a 13% reduction in fuel consumption in urban and regional use for controlled-temperature trucks. The project produced the laboratory vehicle, Urban Lab 2, which, after seven months of testing and 4,500 km of driving on open roads or a roll-bench, achieved the initial targets. Urban Lab 2 uses 12.8% less fuel than the Renault Trucks D Wide (the reference vehicle), totalling a reduction of 3.5 litres of fuel and 9kg of CO2 per 100 kilometres.
Test cycle and measuring methods
To build a test cycle that was statistically representative of controlled-temperature distribution use, engineers at Renault Trucks used a database containing over 8,000 km of measurements.
This open-road cycle consists of 12 km in urban environments, 50 km on regional roads and 57 km on motorways.
Prior to testing, both the Urban Lab 2 and the reference vehicle were run in on the roll-bench and a detailed performance report of the drive trains of the vehicles was drawn up to ensure the two vehicles used for the project were representative.
Testing was performed on roads, the roll-bench (where road and temperature conditions are simulated, controlled and reproducible) and using simulation software in order to correlate the measurements. Alongside this, tests were conducted with a reference vehicle with drive train and geometric characteristics similar to the laboratory vehicle (D Wide 19 t and 280 hp, fitted with a Lamberet refrigerated body). Each of the technologies developed under the project was evaluated separately.
Assessment of aerodynamic improvements
In collaboration with Lamberet, Renault Trucks worked on the aerodynamics of the truck and refrigerated body.
To improve airflow, evaporators were fitted into the roof of the body, whilst the refrigeration unit was installed in the wheelbase of the vehicle. Aerodynamic features were added, including rear spoilers and retractable textile side deflectors jointly designed by Renault Trucks and Lamberet. Access steps, streamlined wheel covers, a roof deflector, spoiler and cabin side deflectors were also fitted. Last but not least, a system of cameras replaced conventional wing mirrors.
Improvements resulting from aerodynamic fittings were measured on the motorway section of the test cycle. These measurements were recorded early in the morning to avoid any disturbance caused by wind, the speed of which was recorded at three separate points to ensure weather conditions were identical for the Urban Lab 2 and the reference vehicle. The test protocol was repeated seven times to ensure reliability of the results.
The results obtained were correlated using simulation to measure gains over the full cycle. Differences between tare weights and electricity consumption between the two vehicles were taken into account in the simulations.
The results of these tests confirmed that optimising aerodynamics is one of the key levers for reducing the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of distribution vehicles, especially when used in peri-urban environments.
Integration of the micro-hybrid system
A combination of micro-hybrid and Stop & Start technologies, designed with Valeo, was tested on the Urban Lab 2.
Several micro-hybrid system operating strategies were tested to maximise the energy recovered both during braking and over-run. In addition, considerable time and effort was devoted to engine stop/start strategies to reduce time and minimise vibration.
Three types of micro-hybrid system consumption tests were performed on the roll-bench:
– without the micro-hybrid system, in the standard configuration;
– with the micro-hybrid system, without the Stop & Start system;
– with the micro-hybrid system and the Stop & Start system.
The Stop & Start and micro-hybrid systems confirmed significant gains in fuel consumption, especially in urban environments.
Vehicle-infrastructure connectivity
Urban Lab 2 features an on-board navigation system developed by BeNomad, together with a traffic light communication system. This infrastructure connectivity enables the Urban Lab 2 to receive information from traffic lights and calculate whether it is more efficient to accelerate or brake.
To establish the impact of this technology on fuel consumption, measurements were first taken on the urban segments of the test cycle to characterise actual traffic and lights. A number of simulations took different traffic conditions into account and staggered start times were required to obtain reliable statistics.
Tests were then conducted on a closed circuit, followed by testing in real conditions on open roads in Bordeaux. The latter tests confirmed the accuracy of the algorithm taking control of the vehicle, in deceleration phase, to optimise fuel savings.
This driver-assistance technology provides significant improvements not only in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, but also in terms of driver comfort.
Reducing the rolling resistance of tyres
Urban Lab 2 is fitted with Michelin prototype tyres, developed to reduce rolling resistance without negatively impacting other performance criteria, such as safety, grip or longevity.
Tyre performance measurements were recorded on the regional and motorway sections of the cycle. Three testing sequences were conducted with the reference vehicle and demonstration vehicle to measure the increase in temperature and pressure of each of the tyres.
On this basis, a simulation model specially developed by Michelin measures developments in rolling resistance throughout the cycle. This enables differences in fuel consumption to be measured more accurately, compared to the standard method of using a fixed optimal rolling resistance coefficient (ISO value).
The EDIT project has confirmed the relevance of the technologies used in achieving the targeted reduction in fuel consumption. Work on the laboratory vehicle helps Renault Trucks to better understand the physical mechanisms that lead to this reduction and develop the technical solutions of its future products, in particular to meet future CO2 emission standards.
Although Urban Lab 2 was not designed to be marketed in its current form, the most effective technologies in terms of performance may well be integrated in production vehicles.

Alfa Romeo Brand
Alfa Romeo brand sales of 2,249 vehicles were up significantly compared with the same month a year ago. Stelvio led the brand with 1,231 vehicle sales, followed by Giulia at 979 vehicles.
Method of Determining FCA US LLC’s Monthly Sales. FCA US’s reported vehicle sales represent unit sales of vehicles to retail customers, deliveries of vehicles to fleet customers and to others such as FCA US’s employees and retirees as well as vehicles used for marketing. Most of these reported sales reflect retail sales made by dealers out of their own inventory of vehicles previously purchased by them from FCA US. Reported vehicle units sales do not correspond to FCA US’s reported revenues, which are based on FCA US’s sale and delivery of vehicles, and typically recognized upon shipment to the dealer or end customer. As announced on July 26, 2016, FCA US has modified its methodology for monthly sales reporting as follows:
Sales to retail customers by dealers in the U.S. are derived from the New Vehicle Delivery Report (“NVDR”) system and are determined as the sum of (A) all sales recorded by dealers during the month net of all unwound transactions recorded to the end of that month (whether the original sale was recorded in the current month or any prior month); plus (B) all sales of vehicles during that month attributable to past unwinds that had previously been reversed in determining monthly sales (in the current or prior months).
Fleet sales are recorded upon the shipment of the vehicle by FCA US to the customer or end user.
Other retail sales are recorded either (A) when the sale is recorded in the NVDR system (for sales by dealers in Puerto Rico and limited sales made through distributors that submit NVDRs in the same manner as for sales by U.S. dealers) or (B) upon receipt of a similar delivery notification (for vehicles for which NVDRs are not entered such as vehicles for FCA employees).
About FCA US LLC

"Hyundai Motor claimed a double victory at last night’s Auto Express New Car Awards 2018 winning Affordable Electric Car of the Year for the new KONA Electric and Affordable Hybrid Car of the Year.
The All-New Hyundai Kona Electric fought off competition from the Nissan Leaf and Volkswagen e-Golf and was commended by the judges for its long range of 300-miles on a single charge and its affordable price.
Steve Fowler, Editor-in-Chief, Auto Express, said: “Launching an all-electric SUV means Hyundai has tapped into two of the fastest-growing parts of the market. The Kona Electric has a 300-mile range, so it can go further on a single charge than some of its closest rivals. Add an affordable price tag and it shows that genuinely mainstream electric cars are now viable. The Kona Electric is an outstanding package, which is why we’ve named it Affordable Electric Car of the Year 2018.
IONIQ Plug-In Hybrid outshone other hybrids including the Toyota Prius in the affordable hybrid category, impressing with its efficiency, comfort and technology.
“Our time in the real world with an Hyundai IONIQ PHEV revealed it to be a very efficient car indeed, averaging more than 80mpg almost effortlessly over 4,000 miles. CO2 emissions of 26g/km bolster the IONIQ PHEV’s green credentials. And yet it’s still a spacious, comfortable, well-equipped hatchback – and a deserved winner of our Affordable Hybrid Car of the Year 2018 award.”
Alongside the wins, Hyundai models were shortlisted in six of the New Car categories and the much-lauded i30N was Highly Commended in the Hot Hatch category.
Tony Whitehorn, President and CEO, Hyundai Motor UK, added, “To win two significant titles from Auto Express for Kona Electric – a car which will be available to order soon in the UK – and the IONIQ Plug-In Hybrid is a real testament to our commitment to reducing the environmental impact of our vehicles.
“As a business, we are investing significantly in green technologies and the IONIQ, KONA Electric and the forthcoming fuel cell, NEXO are all fruits of that investment. In fact, we will be launching 18 new electrified models before 2025. We’re not putting all our eggs in one basket though – it’s more important that our customers have the choice that best suits their needs.
The Hyundai IONIQ Plug-In Hybrid is available from across the Hyundai dealer network from £25,345* (Premium 1.6 Petrol 141PS DCT) and the Kona Electric – priced from £29,495 exc.

Not to be outdone by its smaller sibling, the Kodiaq secured an equally notable victory in the Large SUV of the year category – giving ŠKODA an impressive lock-out of the two main SUV awards. In winning the 2018 award, the Kodiaq records back-to-back victories, having dominated the category in 2017.
Commenting on the Kodiaq’s repeat win, Steve Fowler said: “After taking its maiden victory at our 2017 New Car Awards, the Kodiaq has reinforced its credentials over the last 12 months to take the title again thanks to its impressive mix of ride and handling, refinement, usability and affordability. With a breadth of ability like this, it’s no surprise it’s our Best Large SUV.”
Another ŠKODA on a winning streak in 2018 was the Octavia Estate. It retained its Estate Car of the Year title – seeing off very strong competition in the process. The judges were wowed by the Octavia’s remarkable practicality and comfort, and found its value for money to be unbeatable.
“The Octavia is arguably the model responsible for changing ŠKODA’s fortunes over the last few decades.” Commented Steve Fowler. “Following a revision last year boasting updated styling and a more advanced infotainment set-up, the brilliant Octavia Estate offers an incredible level of carrying capacity at this level of the market.”
The latest Auto Express Awards add to an ever-growing list of industry accolades for ŠKODA. The Karoq, Kodiaq and Octavia alone have won 22 key automotive titles in the course of the last two years – with this total rising on an almost weekly basis.

"Mercedes-Benz: Advanced technology sets the new Sprint apart at Auto Express Awards
The highly advanced technology on the connected new Sprinter has impressed judges so much that it has been crowned Van of the Year at the Auto Express Awards 2018.
The Sprinter’s ground-breaking on-board technology, including MBUX multimedia system (which is only the second Mercedes-Benz vehicle to benefit from this) and Mercedes PRO connect, enable simpler fleet control with a new level of vehicle management, and received high praise from the Auto Express team.
The new Sprinter took the Van of the Year honour at a ceremony in London last night, with judges commenting: “For the all-new Sprinter, it’s a case of evolution and revolution rolled into one.”
“The evolution comes with the smoother lines outside, improved payload volumes, better fuel economy, lower emissions and a smarter interior. The revolution starts in the cab with the MBUX voice-controlled infotainment system and the standard fitment of Mercedes PRO Connect.”
“With over 1,700 variants, the new Sprinter has all bases covered in the large van sector to suit most needs.”
Steve Bridge, Managing Director, Mercedes-Benz Vans UK Ltd, added: “The connective technology in the New Sprinter is something the commercial vehicle industry has never seen before.”
“We always strive to be pioneers within the commercial vehicle industry and couldn’t be more humbled to receive an accolade which represents our brand, people and products with such honour.”
Like previous generations of the multi-award-winning Mercedes-Benz workhorse, the next Sprinter – which is priced from £24,350* excl. VAT – raises the bar in the large van segment. Since its launch in 1995, the Sprinter has defined and re-defined a whole segment numerous times. It has notched a succession of technological ‘firsts’ including the ESP stability system, Crosswind Assist, the Euro VI emissions standard, COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST, Blind Spot Assist and Lane Keeping Assist, and collected more than 80 industry awards.

"The 2018 minicars, which are built on the same platform, earn an acceptable rating for protection in a passenger-side small overlap front crash.
The earlier version of the Accent earned a poor rating in the driver-side small overlap test, while the Rio earned a marginal rating. Both had high levels of intrusion into the driver’s space, and the driver dummy’s movement was not well-controlled.
In both the tests of the 2013 Accent and the 2013 Rio, intrusion reached 11 inches at the lower door hinge pillar, and movement of the steering column allowed the dummy’s head to slide off the airbag. In the case of the Accent, the head hit the instrumental panel, as the safety belt allowed too much forward movement.
In contrast, in the test of the 2018 Rio, which also applies to the 2018 Accent, the structure was maintained well, and the safety belt and airbags did a good job controlling the dummy’s movement.
In the passenger-side test, the front airbag didn’t work quite as well, resulting in the lower rating. The dummy’s head barely contacted the airbag before sliding off to the right, leaving it vulnerable to contact with the forward structure.
Despite improved crash test performance and a newly available front crash prevention system that earns a superior rating, the Rio and Accent aren’t eligible for a TOP SAFETY PICKaward because of their headlights. The only available headlights earn a poor rating due to inadequate visibility.",www.automotiveworld.com,2018-07-11 00:00:00,10,248415
"The British-built Honda Civic Type R has taken home another trophy, this time at the 2018 Auto Express Awards, taking the title of Best Hot Hatch for the second year running.
Widely acknowledged as one of the most prestigious awards of the car industry, the annual Auto Express New Car Awards are given to the cars that set the highest standards in their class each year. These awards are highly important for both carmakers and customers because of the authority and integrity of the Auto Express brand.
Built in Swindon, the Civic Type R shares the same fundamentals as the new Civic hatchback and has been engineered from the ground up to deliver the most rewarding drive in the hot-hatch segment – both on road and on the racetrack.
Phil Webb, Head of Car at Honda UK, commented: “Demonstrating its huge popularity and that front wheel drive still rewards drivers in an increasingly competitive sector, the British-built Civic Type R shows no sign of ending its winning streak; collecting award after award. This is the second year running the car has won Best Hot Hatch at the Auto Express awards. I’ve just had to order another trophy cabinet!”
Steve Fowler, Editor-in-chief at Auto Express added: “For a second straight year the Honda Civic Type R has fought off an incredibly tough group of rivals to take the title of Auto Express’s Best Hot Hatch. That’s thanks in part to the pure front-wheel-drive layout and manual gearbox, which put you at the heart of the action. The Civic Type R’s first-class engineering makes it as exciting and entertaining as a hot hatch can be.”
Available for under £300 a month, the Civic Type R has a top speed of 169mph and can do the 0-62mph sprint in just 5.7 seconds. The power comes from the 2.0-litre VTEC TURBO engine that has been optimised and refined to produce 320 PS with peak torque of 400 Nm.

"The City of Paris and Groupe Renault share their vision of new urban electric mobility services
The City of Paris and Groupe Renault today announce their intention to share their expertise and skills to develop electric mobility for Parisians, Ile-de-France residents and visitors.
This unprecedented approach between a metropolis and Europe’s leading electric vehicle manufacturer is testament to a shared vision of the future of mobility, in the face of challenges such as public health, climate change, easier travel, accessibility and economic attractiveness.
This will result in short, medium and long-term actions in favour of the development of connected and autonomous electric vehicles.
As a first step, Groupe Renault will gradually roll out a commercial offer of electric mobility for Parisians, Ile-de-France residents and visitors, starting in September 2018:
An electric VTC* offer via Marcel from Groupe Renault;
An offer of self-service car-sharing electric vehicles accessible 24/7 and without stations;
An offer of self-service electric vehicles in carsharing loop, for longer journeys, accessible 24/7 from Renault or partner car parks.
This offer will be based on Groupe Renault’s 100% electric range: ZOE, Twizy, Kangoo van Z.E and Master Z.E. By the end of 2019, they will represent a fleet of 2,000 electric vehicles.
In a second phase, the City of Paris and Groupe Renault wish to initiate an open working group, associating major cities and companies, whose aim will be to think collectively about the integration of changes in mobility in the city.
This global initiative for sustainable mobility will be a space for dialogue, expertise, experimentation and acceleration of the development of new mobility services, as close as possible to citizens’ expectations and uses.
It will draw in particular on the expertise of the C40 network, which brings together some 100 cities around the world and is currently chaired by Anne Hidalgo.
Anne Hidalgo, Mayor of Paris and President of C40, said: “Cities and car manufacturers have a vocation to join forces for the future of mobility. Paris and Groupe Renault are now leading the way by converging their action in the areas of car sharing and electric motors. This will make it possible to offer Parisians and Ile-de-France residents a healthier, less polluted living environment, where everyone can move more easily. This constructive agreement is also an opportunity to promote major technological and industrial advances, which contribute to the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and create sustainable jobs and activities.“.
Thierry Bolloré, Executive Vice President of Groupe Renault, said: “As the European leader in electric vehicles, Groupe Renault has also been a player in mobility services for several years, notably through Renault Mobility and the Zity car-sharing system in Madrid. Today, we are delighted to be part of the City of Paris’ desire to develop electric mobility for all, which is safe and respectful of the environment. This shared vision launches an ambitious model that can inspire many cities in France and around the world.”

"The Mazda MX-5 has been named Roadster of the Year by Auto Express in their annual New Car Awards. With the MX-5 convertible taking the title in both 2015 and 2016, and the MX-5 RF winning last year, this award for the whole range means this is the fourth consecutive year that the latest generation of Mazda MX-5 has secured this coveted title.
Commenting on the MX-5’s continued success, Sean Carson, Auto Express Chief Reviewer said, “the MX-5 is an iconic roadster. Unlike most cars which get successively heavier, the fourth-generation MX-5 is a featherweight, which means it offers superb dynamics and a rewarding driving experience. This is enhanced by the choice of responsive 1.5 and 2.0-litre naturally aspirated engines, and one of the most involving manual gearboxes on sale. It’s a delight to drive”.
Adding, “There’s also a choice between soft-top and RF variants, with the former offering wind-in-the-hair thrills and enjoyment and the latter supercar-like looks thanks to the electrically operated targa style roof. Whichever one you choose there’s plenty of style to match the thrill on offer from behind the wheel served up by the precise steering and the sweetly balanced rear-wheel drive chassis. With all these attributes combined it’s easy to see why the MX-5 is the world’s best-selling two-seater roadster and an Auto Express Awards champion.”
Having made its UK debut at the 2015 Goodwood Festival of Speed, the Mazda MX-5 is available in the UK from £18,995 (OTR). With a superior power to weight ratio, rear-wheel drive, perfect 50:50 weight distribution and more comfort and technology than ever before, the Mazda MX-5 is pure roadster. These dynamic proportions combined with Mazda’s KODO: Soul of Motion design philosophy ensures that the Mazda MX-5’s styling reflects its focus on driving pleasure in an unmistakably contemporary and dynamic way.
The Mazda MX-5 reaffirms Mazda’s dominance of the affordable sports car sector. Offered with a choice of two SKYACTIV-G petrol engines it comes with generous standard equipment and new levels of safety technology.
Maintaining the driver-focused ethos that has made the Mazda MX-5 the world’s bestselling two-seater sports car of all time, the latest MX-5 was conceived and developed under the concept of “innovate in order to preserve”. This engineering philosophy has allowed Mazda to maintain the agility, fun and engagement that has always defined the MX-5 while at the same time meeting ever-increasing safety and efficiency requirements, alongside improved refinement.
Jeremy Thomson, Mazda Motors UK Managing Director commented “Our engineers have created a sports car that incorporates our ground-breaking SKYACTIV technology, modern safety and superb efficiency with the driver focused enjoyment for which the MX-5 is loved. The MX-5 is Mazda’s brand icon and it embodies all that is great about our products. Its fun to drive character has strengthened the bond between Mazda and its customers for over 25 years”.
Adding, “It’s an interesting fact that when the MX-5 first launched in 1990, the 115ps Mk1 MX-5 cost £14,249 (equal to £31,687 in today’s money), yet 25 years later with vastly more standard equipment, the Mazda MX-5 costs from £18,995 meaning more than ever the Mazda MX-5 sets the benchmark as the one of the world’s best and most affordable sports cars. We are thrilled that Auto Express has named the Mazda MX-5 Roadster of the Year for the fourth consecutive year. And with the convertible Z-Sport and Sport Black RF special editions now in the line-up, we have an unrivalled choice of MX-5s in the range, which means that anyone wanting to drive a distinctive and stylish roadster can find what they need with one of our special edition models.”

"The all-electric Jaguar I-PACE has been named Car of the Year at the 2018 Auto Express New Car Awards with Editor-in-Chief Steve Fowler describing it as: “the most exciting new car we’ve tested over the past 12 months.”
Jaguar’s first all-electric vehicle also collected the Electric Car of the Year title at the annual awards held in London last night.
The Jaguar I-PACE is the electric vehicle drivers have been waiting for. Clean, smart and safe, the I-PACE delivers sustainable sports car performance, next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) technology and five-seat SUV practicality to place Jaguar at the forefront of the EV revolution.
Steve Fowler, Editor-in-chief of Auto Express said: “The I-PACE proves that brilliant electric cars are right here, right now – it’s the most exciting new car we’ve tested over the past 12 months. We love the way it looks, the space and quality of the interior and most of all that it drives exactly how a modern-day Jaguar should – it’s fantastic fun. On top of all that, it’ll cover city-to-city distances on a single charge in complete comfort – it’s a massively impressive car that bodes well for our electric future.”
The all-electric I-PACE is fitted with a state-of-the-art 90kWh Lithium-ion battery, two Jaguar-designed in-house motors and a bespoke aluminum structure for 0-60mph in 4.5 seconds and a range of 298 miles (WLTP).
Ian Callum, Jaguar Director of Design said: “We are delighted to pick up such a prestigious accolade for our first all-electric Jaguar. We started with a blank canvas and the goal of creating the world’s most desirable electric vehicle and recognition like this from Auto Express shows that the I-PACE certainly meets that challenge. What I’m most proud of is that we have created a Jaguar first and foremost, a Jaguar that happens to be electric. The I-PACE has all of the stunning design cues, characteristics and breadth of dynamic capability that is inherent in our vehicles. It is the Jaguar of the future, here today.”
The Auto Express Car of the Year award is the latest success in an incredible launch for Jaguar’s first all-electric vehicle. It has received extremely positive reviews following the first-ever media drives recently and last month was named a ‘Game Changer’ by Autocar at their 2018 Awards.
At the start of June two-time Wimbledon Champion, Andy Murray, fulfilled the promise he made during WWF’s World Earth Hour to ‘go electric’ and become one of the first Jaguar I-PACE customers on World Environment Day.

"The all-new Ford Fiesta continues to be popular with both the buying public and the motoring media, as it celebrates another prestigious industry award.
Fiesta has won Auto Express magazine’s Supermini of the Year award, capping off a highly-successful first half of 2018 for Britain’s favourite car.
The latest win for Fiesta is the eighth this year, having already been declared Car of the Year and Best Small Car by Carbuyer.co.uk, sister site to Auto Express.
More than 50,000 new Fiestas have found homes on British driveways this year, with buyers loving its value, comfort and ride, as well as over a dozen safety and driver assist technologies including automatically halting the car in the event of a pedestrian stepping into its path.
Andy Barratt, Ford of Britain chairman and managing director, said: “As best-selling car for over 10 years, us Brits have truly taken the Ford Fiesta to our hearts. The pressure was on to deliver a replacement which would continue Fiesta’s reign – which Ford has done and Auto Express has recognised.”
The new Fiesta ST just on sale promises to raise the bar for supermini hot hatches, with 200PS generated by its all-new, three-cylinder, 1.5-litre EcoBoost engine and handling to match thanks to three selectable Drive Modes.
The Fiesta Active offers a muscular new look, literally raising the Fiesta above the crowd. SUV-inspired styling includes roof rails, wider wheel arches, and distinctive 17” alloy wheels.
Whether a sports ST, Active crossover, luxury Vignale or other model in the new Fiesta range, all come with the highest five-star Euro NCAP rating thanks to its lane-keeping alert, seatbelt minder and speed limiter for when taken out by inexperienced drivers.

"Vauxhall’s flagship Insignia Grand Sport has been named Family Car of the Year at the Auto Express Awards 2018.
Held in London last night, the 2018 awards mark 30 years since Auto Express was launched in 1988. Faced with tough judging criteria and a voting panel composed of the magazine’s expert reviewers, only the very best cars make it onto the winners’ list, making this win for the Vauxhall Insignia even more impressive.
“Space is one of the biggest priorities for a car in this class, and the Insignia Grand Sport delivers it by the shedload,” said Steve Fowler, Editor-in-Chief at Auto Express. “It looks great inside and out, and is packed with tech. It’s superbly refined on the move, and there are some efficient engines. Best of all is its price tag. You can park an Insignia Grand Sport on your driveway for a little over £19,000.”
Sporting elegant lines, class-leading aerodynamics and a large coupé design inspired by the 2013 Monza Concept, the new Insignia is up to 175kg lighter than its predecessor. The Insignia is packed with the latest technology including Lane Keep Assist and Automatic Emergency Braking, ensuring a high level of safety. In addition, next-generation IntelliLux LED Matrix lighting is available, delivering performance without dazzling oncoming drivers.

“We are delighted that our flagship Insignia has been recognised by Auto Express at its annual awards,” said Stephen Norman, Vauxhall’s Managing Director. “The Insignia Grand Sport is the ideal family car thanks to its elegant styling, equipment levels and affordable price.”
The Insignia has proved popular among both fleet and family buyers and is sold alongside the Insignia Country Tourer, Sports Tourer and the all-new performance-tuned GSi. In addition to this latest award, the new Insignia has been recognised at the Company Car Today CCT100 and 4×4 magazine awards.

"Volkswagen this evening carried off a trio of trophies in the fiercely fought and highly prized annual Auto Express Awards.
The motoring title’s Compact Car of the Year is the current iteration of the perennially popular Volkswagen Golf, while the keenly contested Auto Express City Car of the Year class is once again topped by the Volkswagen up!
Completing the brand’s hat-trick of victories, the Volkswagen UK Marketing team’s innovative and memorable ‘Bam the ram’ activity – created to mark the launch of the new T-Roc SUV at the beginning of the year – claims the respected weekly motoring title’s trophy for Integrated Advertising Campaign of the Year.
The current generation of Golf, Volkswagen’s biggest selling model to date, features some of the brand’s latest engineering, technology and connectivity, all wrapped in an eye-catching and efficient hatchback or estate body style.
Commenting on the Golf’s victory, Auto Express Editor-in-chief Steve Fowler said: “After more than 40 years and seven generations, the Volkswagen Golf has been honed and evolved to the point where it’s still the undisputed king of the class.
“That’s for a multitude of reasons following its successful facelift last year that subtly revitalised the formula, tweaking the styling, adding new engines and extra safety tech to the line-up and improving the infotainment on offer in this Mk 7.5 model.”
Emerging from Volkswagen factories around the globe at an average pace of one every 40 seconds for the last 44 years, the brand’s updated family favourite continues to feature high in the UK best-sellers list as buyers opt for its uniquely appealing mix of reliability, safety and driving pleasure.
Meanwhile the latest Volkswagen up! city car is also a repeat winner with Auto Express.
Claiming the Auto Express 2018 City Car of the Year award, the up! is praised for its quality, refinement, generous interior space and high-end equipment options.
Steve Fowler said: “New city cars have arrived on the market over the last 12 months, but none has managed to knock the Volkswagen up! off its perch.
“It remains a strikingly grown-up little car that’s affordable to buy and run, great fun to drive and offers a clever approach to in-car connectivity. And despite its compact dimensions, there’s still space for four.”
Today’s up! range also demonstrates the breadth of Volkswagen’s engineering and dynamic abilities. It stretches from the stirring and multi-award winning up! GTI to the all-electric e-up!, which adds the option of zero-emission driving to the car’s compelling mix of attributes.
Volkswagen’s confident and stylish new compact SUV, the T-Roc, almost met its match at the start of the year in the cute shape of Bam, the baby ram – star of the brand’s innovative marketing activity.
Volkswagen’s ‘Born Confident’ campaign entered new territory at the turn of the year with a first-of-its-kind media activity which saw Bam, the self-confident ram featured in agency adam&eveDDB’s ads, leap into commercials from other advertisers.
The cross-media activity saw Bam interrupt ads in national press, Out-of-Home, and even in a series of specially created TV ad breaks across Sky’s channels.
Steve said of the T-Roc campaign: “Our judges felt the Volkswagen T-Roc’s ‘Born Confident’ campaign resonated with the audience, and was very well executed.
“The creative really stood out against other campaigns running in the same period, and this will surely be among the most memorable campaigns of the past 12 months – as well as the best executed in whichever media it appeared.”
Receiving the awards on behalf of Volkswagen at the Auto Express Awards tonight (Tuesday) were Director of Volkswagen UK, Alison Jones, and Head of Marketing, Geraldine Ingham.
Geraldine said: “To hear the UK’s biggest-selling automotive magazine speak so warmly about two of the most popular models in the extensive Volkswagen line-up is very gratifying.
“I’m also thrilled by my team’s success in the Integrated Marketing category, of course. Along with our agency, we put a lot of effort into creating something genuinely different and it’s great to see that hard work recognised in this way.”

"Volvo Cars, the premium car maker, today launches M, a new brand that will expand the company’s global mobility operations by providing dependable, on-demand access to cars and services through an intuitive app.
Moreover, M will learn about its users’ needs, preferences and habits, personalising the customer relationship. It will debut in Sweden and the US in the spring of 2019.
“Volvo Cars is becoming more than just a car company. We recognise that urban consumers are rethinking traditional car ownership. M is part of our answer. We are evolving to become a direct-to-consumer services provider under our new mission ‘Freedom to Move’,” said Håkan Samuelsson, Volvo Cars President and Chief Executive.
M is developing proprietary learning technology that asks users about their specific needs instead of merely informing them where they can pick up a car.
“The services currently available mainly offer alternatives to a taxi or public transit,” said Bodil Eriksson, CEO of Volvo Car Mobility. “We’re focused on the way people use the cars they own, which sets us apart. We aim to provide a real alternative to that experience. It should enable us to live life on our terms, getting things done and maximising precious time. We see the opportunity to offer a premium experience.”
In addition to a team of experienced and sought-after digital software engineers and leading talent, M draws on 20 years of learnings and data from Sunfleet, Volvo Car Group’s car-sharing pioneer. Sunfleet is the leading car-sharing company in Sweden, with 500,000 annual transactions and a fleet of 1,700 cars. It will be fully integrated into M in 2019, making the service available to all existing Sunfleet members.
“Mobility is undergoing a fundamental transformation, and Volvo Cars is leading that change. The launch of M creates new sources of revenue for Volvo Cars and will be integral to the company’s ambition to build more than five million direct consumer relationships by the middle of the next decade,” said Mr Samuelsson.
“Stockholm, Sweden, will serve as M’s base of development and where we already conduct extensive testing. A broader Beta test will take place this autumn,” said Ms Eriksson.
Further information about the M service will be released later this year.
About M
Established in 2018, M is a new brand from Volvo Car Mobility, a wholly owned and stand-alone entity within Volvo Car Group that aspires to deliver a better alternative to car ownership for urban and metro consumers. M’s mission is to enable more people to move freely, meaningfully and sustainably. Its proprietary technology platform aims to advance a new generation of consumer mobility services that provide a more intuitive user experience. M draws on two decades of valuable data and experience from car-sharing pioneer Sunfleet.

"Volvo’s new generation of premium SUVs have accomplished a double success at the Auto Express New Car Awards, announced last night. The new XC40 took the title of Small Premium SUV of the Year, while the XC60 with the innovative T8 Twin Engine petrol-electric hybrid powertrain was named Premium Hybrid Car of the Year.
The awards are the latest in a series of top honours earned by both models, including the World Car of the Year title for the XC60, and both European and UK Car of the Year for the XC40.
Summing up the judges’ verdict on the XC40, Steve Fowler, Auto Express Editor-in-Chief, said: “Volvo has scaled down what made its larger SUVs so successful and added all its know-how to create a more affordable, well-proportioned and practical five-seat SUV. The XC40 is loaded with all the latest safety kit, has a wonderful, tech-laden interior and is available with a wide spread of engines. All of this explains why we’ve named it Small Premium SUV of the Year 2018.”
The XC40 is full of advanced and useful technology, including Volvo’s pioneering semi-autonomous Pilot Assist system, available on all models, and the Sensus nine-inch touchscreen and voice-activated control systems that allow easy access to the car’s infotainment and connectivity functions. The XC40’s premium credentials are reflected in its striking styling and an interior that is both supremely practical and comfortable, finished in high-quality materials.
The findings were equally enthusiastic for the XC60 T8 Twin Engine. Steve Fowler said: “It’s not hard to understand why the Volvo XC60 T8 Twin Engine scooped our Premium Hybrid Car of the Year award. With handsome styling, a stunning interior and a petrol-electric drivetrain that allows it to cover up to 26 miles in zero-emissions mode on a single charge, this car is as pleasing to look at as it is to own. It’s a tremendous all-rounder.”
The advanced XC60 T8 Twin Engine comes with a powerful yet efficient 2.0-litre, four-cylinder petrol engine driving the front wheels and an electric motor driving the rears. Together, they provide a total of 390hp and a huge 640Nm of torque, enabling this mid-size SUV to hit 0-62mph in just 5.5 seconds. Yet the high efficiency of its hybrid technology also means CO 2 emissions are as low as 52g/km and the official combined cycle fuel economy figure is up to 122.8mpg (according to the new WLTP, NEDC-derived, testing protocol).
On top of this, the XC60’s elegant Scandinavian design and spacious cabin filled with premium natural materials and cutting-edge technology make it a thoroughly modern, luxurious place in which to travel.
Jon Wakefield, Managing Director of Volvo Car UK, said: “These awards carry great prestige and reaffirm that our new-generation SUV models are giving our brand serious momentum. Although the XC40 is our first ever model in the premium compact SUV market, it has already established itself as the benchmark in the class. For the XC60, our T8 Twin Engine plug-in hybrid adds another layer of technical sophistication that delivers gains both in real-world efficiency and genuine driver appeal.”

"CBS is responding to Big Brother fans’ outcry over incidents that occurred on the reality show’s live feeds.
“BIG BROTHER is a reality show about watching a group of people who have no privacy 24/7 — and capturing every unfiltered moment and conversation in their lives. At times, the houseguests reveal prejudices and exhibit behavior that we do not condone,” the network said in a statement to PEOPLE. “The producers have addressed two such incidents that were seen recently on the 24/7 online feed. In both cases, those involved have been warned about their inappropriate behavior and offensive comments, as well as future consequences. These events will not be part of any future BIG BROTHER broadcast on CBS.”
As TMZ first reported, contestant JC Mounduix jokingly tried to touch his housemates’ genitals with an ice cream scooper, and viewers slammed his behavior on social media. Later, Rachel Swindler and Angela Rummans, who are white, discussed their skin color in a way many felt was racially insensitive, and Rummans used the term “ghetto.”
The houseguests are sequestered from the rest of the world on the show and do not have access to their phones or the internet while they vie for $500,000, so they can not be reached for comment. People can follow their every move inside the house, though, by subscribing to live feeds of the game.
It’s not Big Brother‘s first controversy: In 2001, Justin Sebik was evicted after threatening a contestant with a kitchen knife. And in 2013, multiple contestants were accused of making racist remarks.
Season 20 of Big Brother airs Wednesday and Thursday at 9 p.m. ET and Sunday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.",people.com,2018-07-11 00:00:00,13,118619
"Now a No Entry’s sequel has been nixed by writer-director Anees Bazmee, Fardeen Khan, who could have made a comeback with it, may have to wait for a while more for a comeback, if at all he is interested in making one.
In the environs of today’s Hindi cinema, where economics are increasingly ruthless, most films (unless they revolve around debut-making stars of a high-profile nature, like a Jhanvi Kapoor or Karan Deol) now feature tried-and-tested faces from superstars to the Kartik Aaryan and Disha Patani levels. Here’s looking at 10 actors who will be considered for big films only when these sequels are made, so that the brand and the resultant ensemble cast compensate for the individual lack of commercial appeal. Make no mistake: all these guys are talented, many of them, in fact, super-talented—after all, they have contributed sizably to the brands and made the films and their sequels viable propositions. They have etched and created memorable characters on screen. But it’s just one of those ironies: none of them sell. And not all of them would like to opt for television or the web.
Aashish Chaudhary: Aashish Chaudhary has found his calling on the small screen with the Colors’ detective serial Dev and now its second season Dev 2. His only forthcoming film is Total Dhamaal, the third film in the Dhamaal franchise, as the meek young Parsi boy who can be excruciatingly funny.
Aftab Shivdasani: Almost two decades back, he made his lead debut in Mast after completing a dozen years as a child artiste. And though Aftab Shivdasani had a solo hit in the 2001 Kasoor and some more good performances, his career largely hinges on Awara Pagal Deewana (2002) and Masti (2004). Grand Masti was another ace, though its third installment Great Grand Masti signaled the end of that franchise. But now, with the sequel of Awara… being worked upon, we may see him shine again as the timid dentist.
Arshad Warsi: No matter what he does, Arshad Warsi just cannot live down his Circuit in the Munna Bhai franchise and his volatile Madhav in the four Golmaal laughatons. Happily, it will be just a matter of time before both the next Munna Bhai and Golmaal films happen. And until that, the third film in another comic series in which he rocked, Total Dhamaal, will keep him in the news!
Kunal Khemu: The newest addition to the Golmaal franchise (he entered as a brat in Golmaal 3), Kunal Khemu might another get small boost if directors Raj & DK actually get down to the sequel to their cult comic classic Go Goa Gone, which they have announced after many years of rumors. Riteish Deshmukh: This talented actor is a typecast favourite in comic series despite sensitive performances. Housefull 4 has him, so does Total Dhamaal, and we do not know if he will even get a second role as intense as Ek Villain. Yes, two more of his comic series have been now derailed irretrievably—the erotic Masti and the even more erotic Kyaa Kool Hain Hum brands (he opted out of the third film in this series but obliged later with a cameo). Riteish satisfies himself by producing or acting in quality Marathi films.
Sharman Joshi: He has shown a fair range, but unless 3 Idiots gets a sequel, it is unlikely that there will be a major investment in this young actor who is seen rarely on screen otherwise, as in the recent ensemble-cast 3 Storeys.
Shreyas Talpade: Shreyas Talpade has been one of the perennial assets of the Golmaal series (which he entered with film two—Golmaal Returns), so he will have to wait for the next Golmaal to have a big film. He made one appearance in Housefull 2, but he is not a fixture in that series. His comic turn in last year’s Poster Boys, which he also directed and remade from his own Marathi hit, nosedived for reasons other than lack of merit. But as we said, it’s luck that is primarily at a deficit with all these actors.
Suniel Shetty: And there is no greater example of bad luck than this man. Remove Suniel Shetty from Hera Pheri and Awara Pagal Deewana and both benchmark comedies lose a lot of their funny sheen. A top star for over a decade and also successful as an occasional villain, Suniel does do sporadic films now but is best known as the comic hero of these two laugh-riots. Hera Pheri is now into its third part, and as said earlier, a sequel to Awara… is being planned.
Tusshar Kapoor: He stole the show in all the Golmaal films as the mute, and was also excellent in Kyaa Kool Hain Hum. The next Golmaal will soon be written and made, but his home series Kyaa Kool…is, now, sadly extinct after three members of the series.
Uday Chopra: Known as Yash Chopra’s actor son who has also done many more things, Uday Chopra could not muster success as a solo lead. However, he formed a super-successful team of chalk-and-cheese cops with Abhishek Bachchan in Dhoom, and progressively, Dhoom 2 and Dhoom 3 did better at the box-office. There have been unconfirmed whispers of a Dhoom 4 happening, which are stronger than ever now. And that might bring the fizzy pair back, combating, if we have to believe the buzz, Salman Khan after John Abraham, Hrithik Roshan and Aamir Khan!",www.freepressjournal.in,2018-07-10 00:00:00,36,364563

The FIFA World Cup is a tournament of tears and happiness. While on one side, a few fans are elated with their team being alive in the tournament, on the other side, the enthusiasts are in agony over their teams’ shocking knockout. It is the story of millions of fans who are connected to football with both mind and soul and one such person is Aleks. The six-year-old boy was in Russia with his father to support his mother’s native country – Poland.
However, Aleks was left devasted when the team were eliminated in the group stages but the Colombian fans were filmed offering support. Aleks was in tears when he saw Poland lose 3-0 to Colombia at the Kazan Arena last month. The video of the young boy being consoled by rival fans immediately went viral.

Wee man was in tears after Poland getting eliminated from the World Cup. The Colombian fans were absolutely fantastic with him after the game – easily the best group of supporters I’ve ever sat with.

In the days that followed the match, Meiklejohn learned about Fifa’s #Rivalhug campaign, which promotes friendship between rival sets of fans. He submitted the video to the competition. Eventually, he learned that he had been selected for an all-expenses-paid trip to Moscow.
The video won the hearts of FIFA who then offered the boy and his father a pair of dream tickets to the world cup showdown. Meiklejohn, Aleks’ father told BBC Radio Scotland: “The whole thing has just flipped 100%. It’s just amazing, it’s brilliant.” It is a complete change in fortune for the family who were scammed when they tried to get tickets for the World Cup final in Rio four years ago, BBC reported.
In the video posted on Twitter, Meiklejohn can be seen consoling his son while Colombian fans chant “Polska, Polska, Polska!”. The Scotland fan said the Colombians were “fantastic… easily the best group of supporters I’ve ever sat with”.
“Aleks got a wee bit upset as you would when your team gets put out of the World Cup,” Meiklejohn told BBC Radio Scotland. “All the Colombian fans started to gather round us, started chanting ‘Polska, Polska’, giving us hats, scarves, patting us on our backs, patting us on our heads.
The video was uploaded by Iwona, Aleks’ mother. It was a 15-second video which captured the whole thing. “It went viral and we have had non-stop communication from all over the world for the last six or seven days.

"RYAN DELANEY’S IMPRESSIVE performances during the second-half of last season have been rewarded with an extended contract at Rochdale, as the Irish defender commits his long-term future to the League One club.
Wexford native Delaney joined Rochdale last December and featured 21 times during the 2017/18 campaign as Keith Hill’s side narrowly avoided relegation from the third tier on the final day of the season.
The 21-year-old had been on loan at Cork City for the 2017 League of Ireland campaign, becoming a key member of John Caulfield’s side as they achieved a league and cup double.
Delaney’s outstanding performances for Cork earned him a place in the PFAI Team of the Year, before he returned to England to join Rochdale from Burton Albion, where he struggled to make the breakthrough.
An Ireland U21 international, Delaney impressed for Rochdale last term and having initially signed a two-and-a-half year deal with the club, is now contracted at Spotland Stadium until 2021.
“The manager has shown faith in me, so hopefully now I can prove it and give something back to him,” he said.
“Over the last six months I think the Gaffer and the coaching staff have helped me to improve a lot. Hopefully now in the following years I can keep on improving.”

"Coronation Street’s Jack Webster will have his foot amputated after being diagnosed with sepsis, and in harrowing scenes next week is shown reeling when dad Kevin delivers the news as he comes round from the life-saving operation.
Advertisement
The hard-hitting plot is set to change the Webster family forever, and is the biggest challenge yet for young actor Kyran Bowes, who has played little Jack since 2016.
“When I heard about what would happen to Jack my first words were ‘Wow that is a big story!'” confesses the 11-year-old. “I was a bit nervous at first because I had never heard of sepsis and didn’t know what it does to you. My parents explained to me as much as they knew and we looked it up on the internet.”
Corrie’s research team assisted Bowes in his preparation for Jack’s plight and his reaction to the amputation that saved his life by putting him in touch with a teenager who had been through a similar experience for real.
“The producer Kate Oates arranged for me to meet someone who had been through it, so I could see for myself what sepsis can do to give me the confidence to play the story as true to life as I could. Through the Sepsis Trust I met Sasha Burrell (pictured with Bowes below), who lost both her legs due to having sepsis. She was really nice and kind and very helpful.
“She told me how she felt when she found out she had the condition and after her operation, and how determined she was it wouldn’t stop her doing normal things.”
The emotional fallout of Jack’s brush with death and adapting to life as an amputee will be explored in the coming months, and conversations with Burrell have been invaluable to Bowes. “Sasha explained Jack will have his ups and downs. He’ll be confused and devastated at losing his foot. In the scene where Jack wakes up and realises what has happened, it was a real challenge to make sure I showed the feelings of shock and upset that Jack and Kevin would be going through.
“You wouldn’t think Sasha had been through such a horrible illness, she is so brave and happy, smiling all the time. She was happy to help me, and very inspirational. She explained how she focused on positive goals – she even started trampolining which she had never done before the illness. Because Jack likes football she said he should concentrate on his football goals, be determined to play the sport again and to persevere.
“I hope I’ve done the story proud,” says Bowes. “Sepsis is a terrible illness and I hope Corrie helps others and raises lots of awareness.”

"YEREVAN, JULY 4, ARMENPRESS. Davit Harutyunyan, the Republican Party (HHK) politician who is a former justice minister, says he doesn’t see the party’s responsibility in the arrests and discoveries of abuses involving HHK members. Harutyunyan says he regrets over the occurrences, and adds that his treatment for a criminal doesn’t differ because of their party-affiliation.
“The Republican party was a large party having government tools, if we look statistically, naturally problems here could’ve been much more than in smaller parties,” he said.
Harutyunyan didn’t deny that such scandalous discoveries didn’t happen in the previous government, but he says that similar cases have happened and the guilty have been held accountable.
He says that the statements of security agencies cause uncertainty over some issues. He said that the statement over Hayastan All Armenian Fund’s director, currently in custody, is unclear.
“It says he infused personal money to the accounts to cover up the misappropriation. If indeed he has paid the entire money from his own pocket then I wouldn’t see misappropriation here, but I don’t have any information and I don’t tend to justify anyone,” he said.
Regarding the charges brought against former Michael Harutyunyan over the 2008 March 1 events, Harutyunyan said the charges are a serious error. He said that Harutyunyan is charged under Article 300.1, an article which didn’t exists back in 2008, thus a criminally liable act cannot have retroactive force.
“I hope today our law enforcement agencies will treat their work more vigilantly because such errors devaluate the other work,” he said.
Regarding illicit enrichment discoveries, Harutyunyan noted that any unexplainable enrichment made before July 1, 2017 isn’t criminalized.

"YEREVAN, JULY 4, ARMENPRESS. The Information and Public Relations Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Artsakh has released a comment on the UN Security Council Resolutions on the Azerbaijan-Karabakh Conflict.
ARMENPRESS presents the full comment:
“In view of the ceaseless attempts of Azerbaijan to manipulate the UN Security Council resolutions on the Azerbaijan-Karabakh conflict, we consider it necessary to state the following:
The UN Security Council resolutions on the Azerbaijan-Karabakh conflict were adopted in 1993, during the active hostilities, and were aimed at putting an end to the war and to start political dialogue. This was due to the main requirement of all four resolutions – cessation of all hostilities and hostile acts.
The UN Security Council resolutions have never been implemented due to the position of Azerbaijan, which categorically refused to be bound by the obligations to cease the hostilities, while insisting on Artsakh’s unilateral concessions undermining the military security. Even after passing the resolutions, Azerbaijan had repeatedly violated the ceasefire agreements, which is explicitly stated in resolution 884, and rejected the proposals on the establishment or extension of ceasefire.
Moreover, Azerbaijan failed to comply not only with the most important requirement of the resolutions on an immediate ceasefire, cessation of all hostilities and hostile acts, but also with all the other ones: to refrain from any actions that obstruct the peaceful solution of the conflict (Resolutions 822, 853); to continue the negotiations through direct contacts between the parties (Resolution 853); to restore the economic, transport, and energy links in the region (Resolution 853); to ensure the unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts (Resolutions 822, 853, 874).
Azerbaijan demonstrates the same selective approach to the ""Adjusted timetable of urgent steps to implement Security Council Resolutions 822 and 853"", which was agreed upon and proposed to the parties by the OSCE Minsk Group. The basis of this proposal, supported by the UN Security Council Resolution 874, is the provision on the recognition of the leadership of Nagorno Karabakh as one of the three parties to the conflict.
The episode with the May 1993 appeal of the Italian Chairmanship of the CSCE Minsk Conference to the conflicting parties for confirming their readiness to implement resolution 822 adopted on April 30, 1993 is a characteristic example of Azerbaijan's real and not declared attitude to the UN Security Council resolutions. Despite the fact that Azerbaijan was the initiator of passing this resolution, it left the request of the Italian Chairmanship unanswered.
Through all its actions, Baku demonstrated that it considered the UN Security Council resolutions not as a means of ending the war, but as an instrument for achieving a military advantage.
Azerbaijan's sabotage of the resolutions devalued them to an extent that the UN Security Council ceased to adopt new resolutions, and the mediators were forced to search another political and legal basis for a ceasefire. It became the April 15, 1994 statement of the Council of the Heads of State of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Bishkek Protocol signed by the Parliament Speakers of Nagorno Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan on May 5-8, 1994, which ultimately paved the way for the May 12, 1994 Agreement on a complete ceasefire and cessation of military activities. It should be stressed that under this agreement, all the parties publicly confirmed the coordinates for the line of ceasefire, thus defining the status quo post bellum. The violation of the line of ceasefire by Azerbaijan during the April 2016 aggression became a serious challenge for the entire conflict settlement process. Restoration of the line’s configuration as of May 1994 is an indispensable factor for maintaining peace in the region and an effective deterrent.
Azerbaijan’s attempts to present the UN Security Council resolutions, which Azerbaijan itself violated, as having binding force in the settlement of the Azerbaijan-Karabakh conflict have no legal reasoning and pursue hidden goals that run counter to the negotiation process.
Neither before nor after passing the resolutions, the UN Security Council considered the issue of political settlement of the Azerbaijan-Karabakh conflict, refraining from direct mediation initiatives in support of the CSCE / OSCE efforts, which is directly stated in the resolutions. This is also indicated by the fact that after signing the May 12, 1994 trilateral termless Agreement on a full ceasefire and cessation of hostilities, the UN Security Council no longer returned to the issue of the Azerbaijan-Karabakh conflict.
It should also be taken into account that according to the UN Charter, the Security Council can make both decisions and recommendations. When considering issues related to the legal force of the UN Security Council documents, the International Court of Justice concluded that the decisions of the Security Council are binding for states, while the recommendations are not. All the resolutions of the UN Security Council adopted with regard to the Azerbaijan-Karabakh conflict are recommendatory and not binding.
If Azerbaijan really had considered the resolutions of the UN Security Council as binding and referred to them, proceeding from the interests of achieving final peace, then it would have implemented the requirements and appeals of the resolutions, which mostly refer to Baku.
On the contrary, the targeted policy of the Azerbaijani authorities on destabilizing the situation on the Line of Contact between the armed forces of the Republic of Artsakh and Azerbaijan, Baku's refusal to implement confidence-building measures and to reduce tensions, its propaganda of xenophobia and hatred towards Armenians, refusal to negotiate directly with Artsakh, as well as its efforts to isolate Artsakh by preventing the visits of representatives of specialized UN agencies to the Republic run counter to the letter and spirit of the UN Security Council resolutions.
Against the background of the incessant threats by the Azerbaijani authorities and, in particular, the statements by the military leadership that the order for the offensive will be given ""at exactly the right moment, taking into account the international political situation"", it becomes obvious that Azerbaijan makes another attempt to manipulate the UN Security Council resolutions in the interests of war, not peace”.",armenpress.am,2018-07-09 00:00:00,26,401600

"YEREVAN, JULY 4, ARMENPRESS. The agenda of summer session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), which was held in Strasbourg from June 25 to 29, was quite full of issues. The works on corruption scandals at PACE continued: they mainly related to Azerbaijan’s “caviar diplomacy” and giving bribes to a group of European lawmakers for many years.
Arpine Hovhannisyan – head of the Armenian delegation at PACE, Vice Speaker of the Armenian Parliament, gave an interview to ARMENPRESS talking about these issues.
-Mrs. Hovhannisyan, during the PACE summer session the works on corruption scandals at the structure continued. These discoveries were linked with Azerbaijan which for many years moved forward its “caviar diplomacy” and gave bribes to the European lawmakers. How do you see the outcome of these disclosures in terms of Azerbaijan’s international reputation, on the one hand, and further activities of these lawmakers, on the other hand?
-First of all I want to state that the PACE session was full of many issues. The issue you mentioned was discussed on Thursday and related to the topic discussed by the Committee on Rules of Procedure. New names and facts are being gradually revealed.
As for Azerbaijan’s reputation or attitude towards that country, it’s very difficult to talk about it since I cannot imagine any non-corrupt PACE MP who will perceive “Azerbaijan’s reputation” phrase in a positive context. The “reputation” of Azerbaijan has exclusively nuance moments which are the corruption scandals, their aggressive behavior. In other words no one doubts on what policy is carried out by Azerbaijan.
All talk about this, all know this, I, of course, talk about those who are not corrupted. All make joint efforts to clear PACE, as an institute, an international structure with its traditions, value system, from that dirt and return to normal discussions. Let’s see to what extend it will succeed.
-Coming to your speech addressed to Azerbaijani delegates where you say in particular: “Remember, what has happened and is possible in Armenia, is even impossible to imagine in Azerbaijan”. You also state that you support the current leadership of Armenia on the matters of strengthening national unity, security, identity and other values. What message did your speech contain?
-This is the reality, this was a message addressed to Azerbaijan as far as they wanted to divert the attention of the PACE from their elections, but one of the main topics of the agenda was their elections. Starting from absence of competition up to multiple violations, tough criticism by the PACE.
What I have said was that what happened in Armenia was an indicator of democracy, it clearly showed the maturity of the former leadership of Armenia, and in fact, it also showed that both the former and current leadership managed to demonstrate so much maturity and restraint that an unprecedented peaceful change of power took place in Armenia. Something that is really difficult to imagine in Azerbaijan under the existence of the Aliyev regime. A truth that is obvious: any citizen and political force of Armenia, regardless of having opposite and contradictory interests, are united on some matters. It first of all relates to the security of Artsakh, it concerns our identity and security issue, we are united on this matter and there is no second opinion here.

"YEREVAN, JULY 4, ARMENPRESS. The president of a major Armenian petrol company operating numerous gas stations across the country has been charged for arrogation (extrajudicial activities) and assault in a 2016 incident.
The incident goes back to 2015 when Beglaryan had suspected one of his former employees, an executive of Flash Motors, in embezzling corporate property.
Barsegh Beglaryan, president of Flash LTD, violently confronted his former employee and demanded to restore the damages. Beglaryan, along with his relatives, threatened the former commercial director to re-name his apartment into their name as compensation for the embezzlement, or pay 20,000 dollars. As a result, the former employee pledged his apartment to a bank and took a loan of nearly 10,000,000 drams, which he gave to Beglaryan.
Beglaryan has been charged based on sufficient evidence involving violent extrajudicial activities.
The investigation continues.

"YEREVAN, JULY 4, ARMENPRESS. United States Ambassador Richard Mills says he expects American investment flow and trade turnover growth in Armenia.
Speaking to ARMENPRESS about the possibilities of American investment increase in terms of the ongoing changes in Armenia and the government change, Ambassador Mills said that this new chapter in Armenia’s history will cause great interest among US investors – both American-Armenian and Americans.
“I was in Washington last week at the Smithsonian’s Folklife Festival, where Armenia was also represented. I hear numerously from both the Diaspora of American and other businessmen that there is great interest towards Armenia. I believe that if the Armenian new government stays committed to its commitments in forming a fair society, creating equal conditions and eradicating corruption, then greater interest will exist in making investments here,” he said.
He said that American investors are interested in the IT, agriculture, tourism and energy sectors. Mills said that the trade and investment growth must be expected between Armenia and the US.

"Warm in blankets, Thai boys smile, joke with rescuer in cave
Their skinny faces illuminated by a flashlight, the Thai soccer teammates stranded more than a week in a partly flooded cave said they were healthy on a video released Wednesday, as heavy rains forecast for later this week could complicate plans to safely extract them.
The 12 boys and their coach are seen sitting with Thai navy SEALs in the dark cave. The boys, many wrapped in foil warming blankets, take turns introducing themselves, folding their hands together in a traditional greeting and saying their names and that they are healthy.
The video lasting about a minute was recorded sometime Tuesday and was posted on the navy SEAL Facebook page Wednesday morning. The navy later released two more videos of the boys.
The boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach disappeared after they went exploring in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in northern Chiang Rai province after a soccer game June 23. The teammates, who were trapped inside when heavy rains flooded the cave, were found by rescue divers late Monday night during a desperate search that drew assistance from experts around the globe.
Authorities said the boys, who had also been shown Tuesday in a video shot by the British diver who discovered them, were being looked after by seven members of the Thai navy SEALs, including medics, who were staying with them inside the cave. They were mostly in stable condition and have received high-protein drinks.
In all of the videos the boys have appeared in good spirits. In the most recent videos a navy SEAL is shown treating minor cuts on the feet and legs of the boys with antibiotic ointment. Several of the boys are seen smiling as they interact with the navy SEAL, who cracks jokes.
Seeing the boys has boosted the mood of relatives, and officials are working to install an internet cable to the cave so that parents can talk to their children.
Kian Kamluang, whose 16-year-old son Pornchai is inside, said she had thought it was a 50 percent chance that her son would be found.
“It’s like he has been given a new life,” she said, adding that she’ll never let her son go into a cave or near water again.
SEAL commander Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yookongkaew said Tuesday that there was no rush to bring the group out of the cave, since they’re safe where they are. The current flooding situation means the boys would have to dive, which rescue experts have said could be extremely dangerous.
While efforts to pump out floodwaters are continuing, some Thai officials have indicated that heavy rains forecast for this weekend could force them to decide the boys should swim and dive out using the same complicated route of narrow passageways through which their rescuers entered.
Chiang Rai provincial Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said Wednesday that the boys have been practicing wearing diving masks and breathing, but he doesn’t believe they have attempted any practice dives.
He said it is unknown when an extraction could be attempted, but it is unlikely to be Wednesday.
“If it’s risky or not safe, we will not proceed yet,” Narongsak said. “It has to be 100 percent safe.”
Authorities said they were still exploring other options, such as scouring the mountainside for other ways into the cave and finding faster ways to pump water from the cave.
Cave rescue experts have said it could be safest to simply supply the boys where they are for now, and wait for the water to go down. That could take months, however, given that Thailand’s rainy season typically lasts through October.
The British Cave Rescue Council, which has members taking part in the operation , said in a statement that “although water levels have dropped, the diving conditions remain difficult and any attempt to dive the boys and their coach out will not be taken lightly because there are significant technical challenges and risks to consider.”
Gary Mitchell, the group’s assistant vice chairman, said getting out of the cave requires about a kilometer (half a mile) of diving total, though not all in one stretch, and takes about three hours.
“There’s air pockets along the way,” he said. “It’s confined spaces. It’s almost zero visibility. There’s currents to battle against in places as well. So it’s a really quite a strenuous environment to be in,” he said.

"Richardson got his start in the early 1990s, when he lucked into a job as the host of “Football Italia,” the first show to air Italian domestic soccer in Britain, after Paul Gascoigne, the mercurial English midfielder who had agreed to be the presenter, stopped turning up for work. (Like a natural-born striker, he has a gift for being in the right place at the right time.) The show’s linking sequences, which featured Richardson eating elaborate desserts and reading the newspaper in sun-dazzled piazzas, gave it an unbuttoned, off-duty feel. Instead of treating soccer like a blood sport, he assumed the attitude of an aesthete, savoring ironies, tracking subplots on and off the field and in general doing his best to show the viewer a good time. You can still hear the warmth and languor of Italy in Richardson’s voice.
Given all these deviations from the norm, it might be tempting to call Richardson an anti-pundit, but that sounds altogether too effortful for a man who embodies the ideal of sprezzatura. “Pundit-satirist” might be nearer the mark, for Richardson’s distinct charm lies in his recognition of the inherent absurdity of what he does for a living. Most people who get paid to talk about soccer in public — to trot out the old chestnuts about players taking their chances and giving 110 percent — deliver their opinions in a tone pitched somewhere between that of an irascible headmaster and a time-strapped auctioneer. Richardson, by contrast, speaks with the breezy spontaneity of someone who knows that nothing, or nothing more serious than entertainment, is really at stake. It is not that he lacks passion — his speech crackles with exclamations of delight: “Woof!” “Wow!” “Mmmm!” “Tasty!” Rather, to adapt a phrase of Geoff Dyer’s, he has mastered the trick of sounding 100 percent ironic and 100 percent sincere at the same time.
In all likelihood, this year’s World Cup final will turn out to be another low-scoring foul-fest, like Italy ’90 or U.S.A. ’94 or South Africa 2010 — or come to think of it, just about every final I have been alive to witness — but, as of this writing, I can still dream of a 4-3 victory for England over Portugal, in which Harry Kane scores the winning goal, a bicycle kick from the edge of the penalty area, in the last minute of extra time and Cristiano Ronaldo is sent off for repeated diving, starts to cry and then trips over his feet as he walks from the field. Whatever happens, it is comforting to know that Richardson will be there at the final whistle with his quips and puns to put the whole harrying joy of soccer fandom into perspective and ease the arrival of the footballing winter to come.",www.nytimes.com,2018-07-08 00:00:00,12,16916

"- Yeah. I don't have a problem with the players, because, typically, around the league, the general managers and the people making the basketball decisions, they don't know the players as well as the players know the players. So it's the front office's job to try to maintain the level that they have been able to-- to rise to. And it's the players' job to either get better in the offseason-- either by their game, by nutrition, strength and-- strength and conditioning-- or communicating to other players to make the roster.
We knew they were going to make some roster changes. JaVale McGee was already going to be gone. Other players are going to be going. So they had to get some players. So I don't have a problem with that. It's-- it's your responsibility, if you are one of the Golden State Warriors, not only how am I going to get better, how can I make this team better.
So I don't have a problem with Draymond. Like I know those NBA guys aren't tough. They talk about meet me outside. They don't mean that. They mean go out there for a cocktail or something. Like they don't mean let's-- let's fight. So all that is just show. So I have no problem.
I-- my biggest problem is, man, Golden State didn't even know the guy was available. And Boogie thinking he had to go to Golden State to save his career, that's where I have a problem with. I do believe there would have been more significant offers for him. And if he wanted to go on a one-year deal, don't go to a team that's stacked, because you're going to get the ball less. How are we going to highlight you more on a team that offensively it's going to be hard to get you the numbers that you've gotten early in your career.
JENNA WOLFE: So why go to Golden State? Why not wait--
NICK WRIGHT: Because it's a free ring.
JENNA WOLFE: --a half a second--
- Because it's a free ring, Jenna.
- I don't-- I can't understand why--
JENNA WOLFE: But not if you listen to what-- not if you go by what your thinking is, which is, you're not going to get the numbers to value yourself--
NICK WRIGHT: But he's still going to--
JENNA WOLFE: --for a max--
NICK WRIGHT: --get the ring. He's still going to--
- --a max salary.
- Listen, it's because--
CRIS CARTER: To me, when you sign a one-year deal, and you're 27 years old and you have an Achilles-- we have not seen someone get better with an Achilles injury-- you need to go somewhere, first of all, that they're going to take their time as far as getting you on the court.
And whatever you're going to play-- 40, 45, 50 games-- in those games, you have to highlight not only what you do off the court-- because you have tremendous attitude problems. People question, can you be focused long enough? Are you a good leader? Are you a good influence on the team? And you need to show them on the basketball court that I can still play the same style. I'm still very, very athletic.
Because I'm worried about Boogie, with the Achilles injury-- he is not an above-the-rim player.
NICK WRIGHT: No.
- He is a technique/skill guy who also has a spot-up jay. Can he do that with an Achilles?
NICK WRIGHT: Listen, Dominique Wilkins, the only player to ever blow his Achilles and come back as good or better. He's the only one. So there's real concerns for Boogie. I understand that. And he might say, well, he had no other offers. That's just flatly not true. He didn't have any max offers. He didn't have any offers that he-- that were immediately, oh, my god, I've got to take them.
JENNA WOLFE: Any long-term offers.
- Well, I think he probably did have some offers that were longer than he--
CRIS CARTER: Yes.
- --wanted, but they weren't at the salary--
- The numbers.
- --commensurate with--
- Uh-huh.
- --what he wanted. But New Orleans wanted to bring him back. Dallas was talking with him before they gave DeAndre Jordan that money. Washington was still interested in trying to execute a sign-and-trade. The idea that, oh, he had nowhere else he could go is flatly not accurate.
When he says to Marc Spears, I had zero offers, I-- I believe what Boogie is saying is, I had zero max offers. I had zero offers like I thought--
CRIS CARTER: Yes.
- --I was getting. I-- and so the idea that nobody else made him an offer is-- is silly.",www.foxsports.com,2018-07-07 00:00:00,60,406313

"Allahabad High Court adjourns hearing of a plea to revive criminal case against Yogi Adityanath
The Allahabad High Court today adjourned hearing of a plea to revive a criminal case against UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for allegedly triggering violence during the meeting of a Samajwadi Party leader at Maharajganj in 1999, resulting in death of a policeman. Justice DS Tripathi adjourned hearing of the plea by Talat Aziz, an SP woman leader, for three weeks. Aziz had alleged that erstwhile Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath had reached the venue of her political meeting at Mahrajganj on February 10, 1999 and created disturbance, resulting in violent clashes and death of Head Constable Satya Prakash, her PSO, due to gun shot injuries.
Besides this FIR lodged by Aziz at Kotwali police station in Mahrajganj against Yogi and several unnamed persons, the then Kotwali SHO too had lodged a case against Yogi and 21 others under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 153A and other sections of the Indian penal Code. Yogi too had lodged a third counter-FIR on the same incident against Aziz and others alleging attack on him by her and others. The matter was subsequently handed over to the CBCID for investigation, which closed the case by submitting a final report in it.
Aggrieved over the report, Talat Aziz had challenged it and filed a protest petition before additional chief judicial magistrate of Mahrajganj. The protest petition of Talat Aziz was treated as criminal complaint case by the magistrate, who, however, dismissed the case on March 13, 2018.

"A rare juvenile foot fossil of our early hominin ancestor, Australopithecus afarensis, exhibits several ape-like foot characteristics that could have aided in foot grasping for climbing trees, a new study shows. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that A. afarensis was exclusively bipedal (using only two legs for walking) and only occasionally climbed into trees. Juvenile hominin fossils provide unique insights into how traits (like foot grasping) become less apparent as the individual grows into adulthood. However, juvenile specimens of most human hominin ancestors are scarce, and thus, it has been difficult to trace how important traits are selected in animals, over time. In 2002, archeologists discovered a well-preserved, partial skeleton of an infant A. afarensis, thought to be around 3-years-old at the time of death. Although this 3.32-million-year-old fossil from Dikika, Ethiopia, was announced in a previous 2006 study, many of the skeleton's elements, including the partial foot known as DIK-1-1f, were encased in sediment and therefore had to be carefully uncovered. Many of these structures have now been exposed after additional preparatory work through 2013, and here, Jeremy M. DeSilva and colleagues report on this juvenile hominin's foot features. They discovered that this infant possessed many of the structures necessary to walk on two legs that have been found in adult specimens, but it also retained a convexity of the medial cuneiform - a bone important for joint movement, such as that involved in climbing - into adulthood, they say. This evidence of increased mobility of the toe is an ape-like pattern that DeSilva et al. say is suggestive of a selective advantage of this trait and which offers new insights into the evolution of bipedality.

"ANN ARBOR--Tropical oceans teem with the dazzle and flash of colorful reef fishes and contain far more species than the cold ocean waters found at high latitudes. This well-known ""latitudinal diversity gradient"" is one of the most famous patterns in biology, and scientists have puzzled over its causes for more than 200 years.
One frequently advanced explanation is that warm reef environments serve as evolutionary hot spots for species formation. But a new study that analyzed the evolutionary relationships between more than 30,000 fish species concludes that the fastest rates of species formation have occurred at the highest latitudes and in the coldest ocean waters.
Over the past several million years, cool-water and polar ocean fishes formed new species twice as fast as the average species of tropical fish, according to the new study, which is scheduled for publication July 4 in the journal Nature.
""These findings are both surprising and paradoxical,"" said University of Michigan evolutionary biologist Daniel Rabosky, lead author of the study. ""A number of hypotheses explain extreme tropical diversity as the result of faster rates of species formation, but it's never been tested in fishes.
""Our results are counterintuitive and unexpected, because we find that speciation is actually fastest in the geographic regions with the lowest species richness.""
The authors admit they cannot fully explain their results, which are incompatible with the idea that the tropics serve as an evolutionary cradle for marine fish diversity. The findings also raise questions about whether the rapid cold-ocean speciation the team documented reflects a recent and ongoing expansion of marine diversity there.
Common sense suggests that a high rate of new species formation will eventually lead to impressive levels of biodiversity. But that depends on how many of the newly formed species survive and how many go extinct. And extinction rates could not be addressed through the methods used in the current study.
""The number of species you find in a region is largely a balance between the rate at which new species form and the rate at which extinction eliminates them,"" Rabosky said. ""The rapid speciation of fishes in cold, high-latitude oceans that we documented will only cause diversity to increase if it is generally higher than extinction.
""Extinction is the missing piece of this puzzle, but it's the most difficult thing to understand. We're now using both fossils and new statistical tools to try to get a handle on what extinction might have been doing in both the polar regions and the tropics.""
In the study, Rabosky and colleagues from eight institutions tested the widely held assumption that species-formation rates are fastest in the tropics by examining the relationship between latitude, species richness and the rate of new species formation among marine fishes. They assembled a time-calibrated evolutionary tree of all 31,526 ray-finned fish species, then focused their analysis on marine species worldwide.
Genetic data were available for more than one-third of the fish species analyzed in the study, and the evolutionary tree was time-calibrated using a database of 139 fossil taxa.
An evolutionary tree, also known as a phylogenetic tree, is a branching diagram showing the inferred evolutionary relationships among various species. The tree assembled for this project is one of the largest time-calibrated phylogenetic trees ever created for any group of animals, according to Rabosky.
The researchers estimated geographic ranges for most of the marine fish species, including all species with genetic data. Then they used complex mathematical and statistical models to estimate the rates at which different groups of fishes split into new species.
""The computational challenges for analyzing these types of data are pretty extreme,"" said study co-author Michael Alfaro, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. The analyses in the study required the equivalent of thousands of desktop computers running continuously for many months, he said.
Some of the fastest rates of new species formation occurred in Antarctic icefish and their relatives. Other temperate and polar groups with exceptionally high speciation rates include snailfish, eelpouts and rockfish.
Three of the largest coral reef-associated fish groups--wrasses, damselfish and gobies--showed low to moderate rates of species formation.
""The fact that coral reefs support many more fish species than polar regions despite these lower rates may have a lot to do with their long history of connectivity and ability to act as a refugia,"" said co-author Peter Cowman of the Australia Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, and previously of Yale University. ""Our research certainly paints coral reef diversity in a new light.""
""Who would have thought that you'd have these really explosive rates of species formation happening in the coldest Antarctic waters, where water is literally at the freezing point and fish like the icefish have to have all kinds of really crazy adaptations to live there, like special antifreeze proteins in their blood to keep it from freezing,"" Rabosky said.

"Einstein's understanding of gravity, as outlined in his general theory of relativity, predicts that all objects fall at the same rate, regardless of their mass or composition. This theory has passed test after test here on Earth, but does it still hold true for some of the most massive and dense objects in the known universe, an aspect of nature known as the Strong Equivalence Principle? An international team of astronomers has given this lingering question its most stringent test ever. Their findings, published in the journal Nature, show that Einstein's insights into gravity still hold sway, even in one of the most extreme scenarios the Universe can offer.
Take away all air, and a hammer and a feather will fall at the same rate - a concept explored by Galileo in the late 1500s and famously illustrated on the Moon by Apollo 15 astronaut David Scott.
Though a bedrock of Newtonian physics, it took Einstein's theory of gravity to express how and why this is so. To date, Einstein's equations have passed all tests, from careful laboratory studies to observations of planets in our solar system. But alternatives to Einstein's general theory of relativity predict that compact objects with extremely strong gravity, like neutron stars, fall a little differently than objects of lesser mass. That difference, these alternate theories predict, would be due to a compact object's so-called gravitational binding energy -- the gravitational energy that holds it together.
In 2011, the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Green Bank Telescope (GBT) discovered a natural laboratory to test this theory in extreme conditions: a triple star system called PSR J0337+1715, located about 4,200 light-years from Earth. This system contains a neutron star in a 1.6-day orbit with a white dwarf star, and the pair in a 327-day orbit with another white dwarf further away.
""This is a unique star system,"" said Ryan Lynch of the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, and coauthor on the paper. ""We don't know of any others quite like it. That makes it a one-of-a-kind laboratory for putting Einstein's theories to the test.""
Since its discovery, the triple system has been observed regularly by the GBT, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope in the Netherlands, and the NSF's Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The GBT has spent more than 400 hours observing this system, taking data and calculating how each object moves in relation to the other.
How were these telescopes able to study this system? This particular neutron star is actually a pulsar. Many pulsars rotate with a consistency that rivals some of the most precise atomic clocks on Earth. ""As one of the most sensitive radio telescopes in the world, the GBT is primed to pick up these faint pulses of radio waves to study extreme physics,"" Lynch said. The neutron star in this system pulses (rotates) 366 times per second.
""We can account for every single pulse of the neutron star since we began our observations,"" said Anne Archibald of the University of Amsterdam and the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy and principal author on the paper. ""We can tell its location to within a few hundred meters. That is a really precise track of where the neutron star has been and where it is going.""
If alternatives to Einstein's picture of gravity were correct, then the neutron star and the inner white dwarf would each fall differently toward the outer white dwarf. ""The inner white dwarf is not as massive or compact as the neutron star, and thus has less gravitational binding energy,"" said Scott Ransom, an astronomer with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Virginia, and co-author on the paper.
Through meticulous observations and careful calculations, the team was able to test the system's gravity using the pulses of the neutron star alone. They found that any acceleration difference between the neutron star and inner white dwarf is too small to detect.
""If there is a difference, it is no more than three parts in a million,"" said coauthor Nina Gusinskaia of the University of Amsterdam. This places severe constraints on any alternative theories to general relativity.
This result is ten times more precise that the previous best test of gravity, making the evidence for Einstein's Strong Equivalence Principle that much stronger. ""We're always looking for better measurements in new places, so our quest to learn about new frontiers in our Universe is going to continue,"" concluded Ransom.

"Expanding the availability of medication treatment for opioid use disorder in primary care settings would be a major step toward reducing overdose deaths, write two physicians specializing in addiction medicine and health care delivery in the July 5 issue of New England Journal of Medicine. In their Perspectives article entitled ""Primary Care and the Opioid-Overdose Crisis - Buprenorphine Myths and Realities,"" Sarah Wakeman, MD, medical director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Substance Use Disorders Initiative and Michael Barnett, MD, of the Department of Health Policy and Management, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, describe current barriers to expanded delivery of buprenorphine treatment and outline possible solutions.
""One of the tragic ironies is that with well-established medical treatment, opioid use disorder can have an excellent prognosis,"" they write, noting that almost 80 percent of Americans with opioid use disorder are unable to receive treatment and that the growth in distribution of buprenorphine - one of three FDA-approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder - has been slowing rather than increasing in recent years. ""To have any hope of stemming the overdose tide, we have to make it easier to obtain buprenorphine than to get heroin and fentanyl.""
The authors describe 5 persistent but inaccurate myths that they believe prevent buprenorphine from being more widely adopted:
That is more dangerous that other common health care interventions,
That buprenorphine treatment is just replacing one addition for another,
That abstinence-based treatment - short-term detoxification and rehabilitation - is more effective than medication-based treatment,
That providing buprenorphine treatment is particularly onerous and time consuming for primary care physicians (PCPs),
That physicians should just reduce opioid prescriptions to address the overdose epidemic
Most outpatient buprenorphine treatment is already provided by PCPs, and expanding the availability of office-based buprenorphine treatment, as several other countries have done, presents a realistic solution to addressing the overdose crisis, the authors note. They write, ""We are in the midst of a historic public health crisis that demands action from every physician. Without dramatic intervention, life expectancy in the United States will continue to decline. Mobilizing the PCP workforce to offer office-based buprenorphine treatment is a plausible, practical, and scalable intervention that could be implemented immediately.""
Wakeman is an assistant professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital; Barnett is an assistant professor of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard Chan School, an instructor in Medicine at HMS and a Brigham and Women's Hospital physician. Their article is one of three addressing improvements in medication treatment for opioid use disorder in the same NEJM issue.

"GAINESVILLE, Fla. --- Each night, dramatic aerial battles are waged above our heads, complete with barrel rolls, razor-sharp turns, sonar jamming, cloaking devices and life-or-death consequences.
But the opponents aren't tricked-out fighter jets. They're bats and moths, adversaries locked in a 60-million-year-old duel marked by stealth and deception.
Previous work by University of Florida and Boise State University researchers showed that some silk moths in the family Saturniidae have a built-in bat decoy: hindwings with long, elaborate ""tails"" that deflect sonar, creating a misleading target. As bats swoop in for the kill, they often strike these expendable tails and not the moth's vital body core.
Now, a new study by the team, published today in Science Advances, illuminates the bat-driven evolution of these decoys across the silk moth family tree and tests four hindwing shapes in real-time dogfights between bats and moths. The verdict? The larger the hindwings and longer the tails, the better the moths' chances of escaping bats on the hunt.
""Once we knew that the tails of silk moths deflect echoes away from their body, we were interested in whether there were optimal anti-predator shapes,"" said study co-author Akito Kawahara, associate curator at the Florida Museum of Natural History's McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity at UF. ""One of the first things we did was go into the collections and look at specimens. There was a ton of variation in hindwing length, shape, color and twisting. We wanted to analyze these characteristics in an evolutionary framework to see what was happening.""
Kawahara and his postdoctoral researcher Chris Hamilton, one of the study's co-lead authors, quantified hindwing shape in silk moths, mapping the evolution of this trait across a detailed family tree. Instead of gradual increases in hindwing length and complexity, they noted abrupt shifts in shape, showing that certain wing shapes might be significantly more effective at deflecting bats than others. Four classes of shapes were linked with moths' ability to escape bat attack: two types of extra-long tails, short tails and long lobes.
These shapes have appeared multiple times in silk moths globally, and nearly identical shapes often showed up in moths that were not close relatives.
""We see moths moving toward peaks of optimal shapes with unrelated moths evolving in similar ways,"" Kawahara said. ""This speaks to bats' selective pressure on their prey.""
After identifying these major hindwing shapes, the team test-drove them against the judges best qualified to rate their efficacy: real bats.
After modifying the hindwings of three types of silk moths - polyphemus moths, luna moths and African moon moths - to match these shapes, researchers in study co-author Jesse Barber's lab at Boise State pit them against big brown bats in a flight room with high-speed cameras and ultrasonic microphones.
Silk moths might be delicately built, but stacked against bats, they are hardly sitting ducks. With wingspans of more than 5 inches, their large size puts pressure on their predators to aim well. Bats and moths also have impressive flight capabilities, said Juliette Rubin, the study's lead author.
""Bats are incredibly acrobatic and very skilled hunters, but moths are also powerful flyers and have an incredible turn radius,"" said Rubin, who completed the research as a Boise State master's student. ""They seem to be pretty well-matched adversaries.""
Unaltered polyphemus moths escaped bats only 27 percent of the time in the flight room. But enlarging their lobed hindwings to match the size of two different tribes of silk moths upped their escape rate to 56 percent.
African moon moths, which have long tails, performed much better with their tails than without. Unaltered moon moths evaded bats 73 percent of the time, but this dropped to 45 percent with shorter tails and 34 percent with none. Luna moths, another tailed species, followed a similar trend.
Bats only eat a moth's body, not its wings, and they need to attack its core to be certain of success. Long tails are likely creating the illusion of multiple targets, confusing bats and tricking them into striking at tails, Rubin said. Because moth flight depends on their forewings, a rear attack often enables them to skirt away safely, even if they lose part of their hindwings in the process.
Rubin said a bat's typical attack behavior can include closing its wings around a moth or extending a wing to scoop a moth into its mouth. But when trying to strike moths with longer tails, ""they'd reach out for the tail ends, and the moths would escape almost every time.""
The power of these sensory illusions as evolutionary drivers is often underappreciated, she said.
""Prey might evolve in ways that exploit weaknesses in the armor of their predators' perception,"" Rubin said. ""We think this is happening across different systems, not just in moths.""
Could bats figure out a way to bypass silk moths' defense tactic? Rubin is skeptical. Even after facing the same types of hindwing shapes for months, bats did not improve their ability to discern a juicy moth body from a useless decoy.
""If these tail traits are altering or manipulating the information bats are receiving as they try to assess where the moth is and where to attack, that could be a hard strategy for bats to get around,"" she said.

"In a novel test of Einstein's theory of general relativity, an international group of astronomers has demonstrated that the theory holds up, even for a massive three-star system.
Einstein's theory states that all objects fall the same way despite their mass or composition, like a cannonball and apple falling off the Leaning Tower of Pisa and hitting the ground at the same time. While this theory works in many situations, others hypothesize there are circumstances when alternative theories of gravity would be at play, such as in instances of extreme gravity. New research published in Nature confirms that, even in an extreme gravity system, the theory of relativity still applies.
""This research shows how routine and careful observation of distant stars can give us a high-precision test of one of the fundamental theories of physics,"" said Ingrid Stairs, professor in the department of physics and astronomy at UBC and a co-author of the study.
The three-star system that the researchers observed, known as PSR J0337+1715, is located 4,200 light years away and is made up of two white dwarfs and a neutron star. White dwarfs are very dense stars; while their size is comparable to Earth, their mass is similar to that of our sun. Neutron stars are even smaller and denser than white dwarfs. They are made from collapsed cores of stars that have undergone supernova explosions and are the densest stars in the universe. Many spinning neutron stars are pulsars, sending regular lighthouse-like electromagnetic signals out through space that can be captured by radio telescopes here on Earth.
After discovering the three-star system, the researchers published a study in Nature in 2014, which noted that the system could be used to test Einstein's theory. The team of astronomers followed the neutron star for six years using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope in the Netherlands, the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.
""We can account for every single pulse of the neutron star since we began our observations. And we can tell its location to within a few hundred meters,"" said Anne Archibald, lead author of the paper and a postdoctoral researcher of the University of Amsterdam and ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. ""That is a really precise track of where the neutron star has been, and where it is going.""
In the three-star system, the neutron star is in a 1.6-day orbit with one white dwarf, and the second white dwarf orbits this pair with a period of 327 days. By tracking the inner pair of stars through the course of several orbits of the outer white dwarf, scientists could measure whether the pulsar and inner white dwarf were affected differently by the gravity of the outer white dwarf. Over time, the researchers found almost no detectable difference, indicating there is little room for alternative theories of gravity in this model.
""If there is a difference, it is no more than three parts in a million,"" says Nina Gusinskaia, PhD student at the University of Amsterdam and a co-author of the study. ""Now, anyone with an alternative theory of gravity has an even narrower range of possibilities that their theory has to fit into, in order to match what we have seen.""
""Every single time we've tested Einstein's theory of relativity so far, the results have been consistent,"" said Stairs. ""But we keep looking for departures from relativity because that might help us understand how to describe gravity and quantum mechanics with the same mathematical language.""

"India will need to feed approximately 394 million more people by 2050, and that's going to be a significant challenge. Nutrient deficiencies are already widespread in India today--30 percent or more are anemic--and many regions are chronically water-stressed. Making matters worse, evidence suggests that monsoons are delivering less rainfall than they used to. But a study published today in Science Advances shares a brighter outlook: replacing some rice with less thirsty crops could dramatically reduce water demand in India, while also improving nutrition.
Starting in the 1960s, a boom in rice and wheat production helped reduce hunger throughout India. Unfortunately, this Green Revolution also took a toll on the environment, increasing demands on the water supply, greenhouse gas emissions, and pollution from fertilizer.
""If we continue to go the route of rice and wheat, with unsustainable resource use and increasing climate variability, it's unclear how long we could keep that practice up,"" says Kyle Davis, a fellow at Columbia University's Earth Institute and lead author on the new study. ""That's why we're thinking of ways to better align food security and environmental goals.""
The study addresses two key objectives of the Indian government: to reduce undernourishment and improve nutrition, and to promote sustainable water use.
A Grain of Truth
Davis and his colleagues studied six major grains currently grown in India: rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, and pearl and finger millet. For each crop, they compared yield, water use, and nutritional values such as calories, protein, iron, and zinc.
They found that rice is the least water-efficient cereal when it comes to producing nutrients, and that wheat has been the main driver in increasing irrigation stresses.
The potential benefits of replacing rice with alternative crops varied widely between different regions, depending on how much the crops could rely on rainfall instead of irrigation. But overall, the researchers found that replacing rice with maize, finger millet, pearl millet, or sorghum could reduce irrigation water demand by 33 percent, while improving production of iron by 27 percent and zinc by 13 percent.
In some instances, those improvements came with a slight reduction in the number of calories produced, because rice has been bred to have higher yields per unit of land. So in some regions there's a tradeoff between water and land use efficiency, but Davis thinks that with more attention from scientists, the alternative crops could develop higher yields as well. For now, rice replacement isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, but something that should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis for each district, he said.
Going Against the Grain
While the findings are promising, the authors stop short of making policy recommendations--yet. First, says Davis, they'd like to add other variables into the analysis, including greenhouse gas emissions, climate sensitivity, and how much labor and money it takes to grow each crop.
In addition, the team wants to study Indian food preferences, to see if people would be willing to incorporate more of these alternative cereals into their diets. Davis is hopeful; ""There are places around India where these crops continue to be consumed in pretty large amounts,"" he says, ""and there were even more a generation or two ago, so it's still within the cultural memory.""
India's state-run Public Distribution System (PDS) could be an ally in influencing consumer preferences. PDS currently subsidizes rice and wheat to support smallholder farmers and low-income households. Those subsidies have given incentives to farmers and consumers to plant and buy those crops, but future policies could help to encourage the use of the more nutritious, water-saving cereals like millet and sorghum.
Momentum is growing in support of alternative grains. Some Indian states are have already started pilot programs to grow more of these crops, and the Indian government is calling 2018 the 'Year of Millets.'
""If the government is able to get people more interested in eating millets, the production will organically respond to that,"" says Davis. ""If you have more demand, then people will pay a better price for it, and farmers will be more willing to plant it.""

"More than 3 million years ago, our ancient human ancestors, including their toddler-aged children, were standing on two feet and walking upright, according to a new study published in Science Advances.
""For the first time, we have an amazing window into what walking was like for a 2½-year-old, more than 3 million years ago,"" says lead author, Jeremy DeSilva, an associate professor of anthropology at Dartmouth College, who is one of the world's foremost authorities on the feet of our earliest ancestors. ""This is the most complete foot of an ancient juvenile ever discovered.""
The tiny foot, about the size of a human thumb, is part of a nearly complete 3.32-million-year-old skeleton of a young female Australopithecus afarensis discovered in 2002 in the Dikika region of Ethiopia by Zeresenay (Zeray) Alemseged, a professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago and senior author of the study. Alemseged is internationally known as a leading paleontologist on the study of human origins and human evolution.
""Placed at a critical time and the cusp of being human, Australopithecus afarensis was more derived than Ardipithecus (a facultative biped) but not yet an obligate strider like Homo erectus. The Dikika foot adds to the wealth of knowledge on the mosaic nature of hominin skeletal evolution"" explained Alemseged.
Given that the fossil of the tiny foot is the same species as the famous Lucy fossil and was found in the same vicinity, it is not surprising that the Dikika child was erroneously labeled ""Lucy's baby"" by the popular press, though this youngster lived more than 200,000 years before Lucy.
In studying the fossil foot's remarkably preserved anatomy, the research team strived to reconstruct what life would have been like years ago for this toddler and how our ancestors survived. They examined what the foot would have been used for, how it developed and what it tells us about human evolution. The fossil record indicates that these ancient ancestors were quite good at walking on two legs. ""Walking on two legs is a hallmark of being human. But, walking poorly in a landscape full of predators is a recipe for extinction,"" explained DeSilva.
At 2½ years old, the Dikika child was already walking on two legs, but there are hints in the fossil foot that she was still spending time in the trees, hanging on to her mother as she foraged for food. Based on the skeletal structure of the child's foot, specifically, the base of the big toe, the kids probably spent more time in the trees than adults. ""If you were living in Africa 3 million years ago without fire, without structures, and without any means of defense, you'd better be able get up in a tree when the sun goes down,"" added DeSilva. ""These findings are critical for understanding the dietary and ecological adaptation of these species and are consistent with our previous research on other parts of the skeleton especially, the shoulder blade,"" Alemseged noted.

"Researchers at Caltech have developed an artificial neural network made out of DNA that can solve a classic machine learning problem: correctly identifying handwritten numbers. The work is a significant step in demonstrating the capacity to program artificial intelligence into synthetic biomolecular circuits.
The work was done in the laboratory of Lulu Qian, assistant professor of bioengineering. A paper describing the research appears online on July 4 and in the July 19 print issue of the journal Nature.
""Though scientists have only just begun to explore creating artificial intelligence in molecular machines, its potential is already undeniable,"" says Qian. ""Similar to how electronic computers and smart phones have made humans more capable than a hundred years ago, artificial molecular machines could make all things made of molecules, perhaps including even paint and bandages, more capable and more responsive to the environment in the hundred years to come.""
Artificial neural networks are mathematical models inspired by the human brain. Despite being much simplified compared to their biological counterparts, artificial neural networks function like networks of neurons and are capable of processing complex information. The Qian laboratory's ultimate goal for this work is to program intelligent behaviors (the ability to compute, make choices, and more) with artificial neural networks made out of DNA.
""Humans each have over 80 billion neurons in the brain, with which they make highly sophisticated decisions. Smaller animals such as roundworms can make simpler decisions using just a few hundred neurons. In this work, we have designed and created biochemical circuits that function like a small network of neurons to classify molecular information substantially more complex than previously possible,"" says Qian.
To illustrate the capability of DNA-based neural networks, Qian laboratory graduate student Kevin Cherry chose a task that is a classic challenge for electronic artificial neural networks: recognizing handwriting.
Human handwriting can vary widely, and so when a person scrutinizes a scribbled sequence of numbers, the brain performs complex computational tasks in order to identify them. Because it can be difficult even for humans to recognize others' sloppy handwriting, identifying handwritten numbers is a common test for programming intelligence into artificial neural networks. These networks must be ""taught"" how to recognize numbers, account for variations in handwriting, then compare an unknown number to their so-called memories and decide the number's identity.
In the work described in the Nature paper, Cherry, who is the first author on the paper, demonstrated that a neural network made out of carefully designed DNA sequences could carry out prescribed chemical reactions to accurately identify ""molecular handwriting."" Unlike visual handwriting that varies in geometrical shape, each example of molecular handwriting does not actually take the shape of a number. Instead, each molecular number is made up of 20 unique DNA strands chosen from 100 molecules, each assigned to represent an individual pixel in any 10 by 10 pattern. These DNA strands are mixed together in a test tube.
""The lack of geometry is not uncommon in natural molecular signatures yet still requires sophisticated biological neural networks to identify them: for example, a mixture of unique odor molecules comprises a smell,"" says Qian.
Given a particular example of molecular handwriting, the DNA neural network can classify it into up to nine categories, each representing one of the nine possible handwritten digits from 1 to 9.
First, Cherry built a DNA neural network to distinguish between handwritten 6s and 7s. He tested 36 handwritten numbers and the test tube neural network correctly identified all of them. His system theoretically has the capability of classifying over 12,000 handwritten 6s and 7s--90 percent of those numbers taken from a database of handwritten numbers used widely for machine learning--into the two possibilities.
Crucial to this process was encoding a ""winner take all"" competitive strategy using DNA molecules, developed by Qian and Cherry. In this strategy, a particular type of DNA molecule dubbed the annihilator was used to select a winner when determining the identity of an unknown number.
""The annihilator forms a complex with one molecule from one competitor and one molecule from a different competitor and reacts to form inert, unreactive species,"" says Cherry. ""The annihilator quickly eats up all of the competitor molecules until only a single competitor species remains. The winning competitor is then restored to a high concentration and produces a fluorescent signal indicating the networks' decision.""
Next, Cherry built upon the principles of his first DNA neural network to develop one even more complex, one that could classify single digit numbers 1 through 9. When given an unknown number, this ""smart soup"" would undergo a series of reactions and output two fluorescent signals, for example, green and yellow to represent a 5, or green and red to represent a 9.
Qian and Cherry plan to develop artificial neural networks that can learn, forming ""memories"" from examples added to the test tube. This way, Qian says, the same smart soup can be trained to perform different tasks.
""Common medical diagnostics detect the presence of a few biomolecules, for example cholesterol or blood glucose."" says Cherry. ""Using more sophisticated biomolecular circuits like ours, diagnostic testing could one day include hundreds of biomolecules, with the analysis and response conducted directly in the molecular environment.""

"Researchers have discovered that stabilizing dysfunctional endothelial cells with approved drugs reverses cellular dysfunction in a rat model of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), hinting towards a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of vascular dementia. As life expectancies climb around the world and society ages, dementia - a group of symptoms characterized by declining memory and cognitive ability - has become a chief concern for scientists and caretakers. One of the most common causes of vascular dementia in the elderly is SVD, which occurs when small blood vessels in the brain are unable to nourish white matter tissue. SVD also contributes to the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and triples the risk of stroke, rendering it a major cause of cognitive disability in the elderly. However, there are still no dependable therapies for the condition, partially due to a lack of understanding of the mechanisms underlying the changes in blood vessels. Here, Rikesh Rajani and colleagues zeroed in on the role of endothelial cells (ECs), which help prevent unwanted substances and cells from entering the brain. The research team studied brains from humans with SVD and observed they harbored dysfunctional ECs, and found a mutation that could be responsible for the dysfunction. Further analysis showed these ECs secreted a protein called HSP90α that impaired proper functioning of isolated connective tissue cells found in the brain. Approved drugs that stabilize ECs such as simvastatin (a cholesterol-lowering medication) reversed abnormalities in a rat model of SVD after seven weeks of treatment. The authors say that future studies should assess whether EC dysfunction can be reversed at a later stage of SVD, as well as test their findings in other animal models.

"Scientists have uncovered a potential approach to treat one of the commonest causes of dementia and stroke in older people.
Studies with rats found the treatment can reverse changes in blood vessels in the brain associated with the condition, called cerebral small vessel disease.
Treatment also prevents damage to brain cells caused by these blood vessel changes, raising hope that it could offer a therapy for dementia.
Small vessel disease, or SVD, is a major cause of dementia and can also worsen the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. It is responsible for almost half of all dementia cases in the UK and is a major cause of stroke, accounting for around one in five cases.
Patients with SVD are diagnosed from brain scans, which detect damage to white matter - a key component of the brain's wiring.
Until now, it was not known how changes in small blood vessels in the brain associated with SVD can cause damage to brain cells.
A team led by the University of Edinburgh found that SVD occurs when cells that line the small blood vessels in the brain become dysfunctional. This causes them to secrete a molecule into the brain.
The molecule stops production of the protective layer that surrounds brain cells - called myelin - which leads to brain damage.
Treating rats with drugs that stop blood vessel cells from becoming dysfunctional reversed the symptoms of SVD and prevented brain damage, tests found.
Researchers say that further studies will need to test whether the treatment also works when the disease is firmly established. They will also need to check if the treatment can reverse the symptoms of dementia.
Dementia is one of the biggest problems facing society, as people live longer and the population ages. Estimates indicate there are almost 47 million people living with dementia worldwide and the numbers affected are expected to double every 20 years, rising to more than 115 million by 2050.
The research, published in Science Translational Medicine, was carried out at the Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine and the UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Edinburgh. It was funded by the MRC, Alzheimer's Research UK and Fondation Leducq.
Professor Anna Williams, Group Leader at the University of Edinburgh's MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, said: ""This important research helps us understand why small vessel disease happens, providing a direct link between small blood vessels and changes in the brain that are linked to dementia. It also shows that these changes may be reversible, which paves the way for potential treatments.""
Dr Sara Imarisio, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK said: ""Changes to the blood supply in the brain play an important role in Alzheimer's disease as well as being a direct cause of vascular dementia. This pioneering research highlights a molecular link between changes to small blood vessels in the brain and damage to the insulating 'white matter' that helps nerve cells to send signals around the brain.
""The findings highlight a promising direction for research into treatments that could limit the damaging effects of blood vessel changes and help keep nerve cells functioning for longer. There are currently no drugs that slow down or stop Alzheimer's disease and no treatments to help people living with vascular dementia. Alzheimer's Research UK is very pleased to have helped fund this innovative research, which is only possible thanks to the work of our dedicated supporters.""
Dr Nathan Richardson, the MRC's Head of Molecular and Cellular Medicine, commented: ""This study is a great example of how innovative discovery science into regenerative mechanisms can be applied to improve our understanding of how vascular changes contribute to dementia. This research in rats opens up new possibilities for developing therapies for cerebral small vessel disease.""

"The effectiveness of antibiotics can be altered by combining them with each other, non-antibiotic drugs or even with food additives
The effectiveness of antibiotics can be altered by combining them with each other, non-antibiotic drugs or even with food additives. Depending on the bacterial species, some combinations stop antibiotics from working to their full potential whilst others begin to defeat antibiotic resistance, report EMBL researchers and collaborators in Nature on July 4.
In the first large-scale screening of its kind, scientists profiled almost 3000 drug combinations on three different disease-causing bacteria. The research was led by EMBL group leader Nassos Typas.
Overcoming antibiotic resistance
Overuse and misuse of antibiotics has led to widespread antibiotic resistance. Specific combinations of drugs can help in fighting multi-drug resistant bacterial infections, but they are largely unexplored and rarely used in clinics. That is why in the current paper, the team systematically studied the effect of antibiotics paired with each other, as well as with other drugs and food additives in different species.
Whilst many of the investigated drug combinations lessened the antibiotics' effect, there were over 500 drug combinations which improved antibiotic outcome. A selection of these positive pairings was also tested in multi-drug resistant bacteria, isolated from infected hospital patients, and were found to improve antibiotic effects.
Clinical vanillin?
When vanillin - the compound that gives vanilla its distinctive taste - was paired with one particular antibiotic known as spectinomycin, it helped the antibiotic to enter bacterial cells and inhibit their growth. Spectinomycin was originally developed in the early-1960s for treating gonorrhoea but is rarely used nowadays due to the bacterial resistance that was developed against it. However, in combination with vanillin it could become clinically relevant once again and used for other disease-causing microbes. ""Of the combinations tested, this was one of the most effective and promising synergies we identified,"" says Ana Rita Brochado, first author on the paper and research scientist at EMBL. Pairings such as this could extend the arsenal of weapons in the war against antibiotic resistance.
Curiously, however, vanillin lessened the effect of many other types of antibiotics. The paper showed that vanillin works in a similar way to aspirin to decrease the activity of many antibiotics - although its effects in human cells have not been tested, they are most likely different.
According to Nassos Typas, combinations of drugs that decrease the effect of antibiotics could also be beneficial to human health. ""Antibiotics can lead to collateral damage and side effects because they target healthy bacteria as well. But the effects of these drug combinations are highly selective, and often only affect a few bacterial species. In the future, we could use drug combinations to selectively prevent the harmful effects of antibiotics on healthy bacteria. This would also decrease antibiotic resistance development, as healthy bacteria would not be put under pressure to evolve antibiotic resistance, which can later be transferred to dangerous bacteria.""

This research is the first large-scale screening of drug combinations across different bacterial species in the lab. The compounds used have already been approved for safe use in humans, but investigations in mice and clinical studies are still required to test the effectiveness of particular drug combinations in humans. In addition to identifying novel drug combinations, the size of this investigation allowed the scientists to understand some of the general principles behind drug-drug interactions. This will allow more rational selection of drug pairs in the future and may be broadly applicable to other therapeutic areas.

"When what we want as individuals clashes with what is best for the group, we have a social dilemma. How can we overcome these dilemmas, and encourage people to cooperate, even if they have reason not to? In a paper released today in Nature, Christian Hilbe and Krishnendu Chatterjee of the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria), together with Martin Nowak of Harvard and Stepan Simsa of Charles University, have shown that if the social dilemma that individuals face is dependent on whether or not they work together, cooperation can triumph. This finding was the result of a new type of framework that they introduced--one that extends the entire theory of repeated games. Moreover, as their work pinpoints the ideal conditions for fostering cooperation, they have provided tools to systematically build cooperation.
The tragedy of the commons: if we can (ab)use a public good without seeing negative consequences, we will--without consideration of others or the future. We see examples of this in our daily lives, from climate change and forest depletion down to the stack of dirty dishes in the office kitchen. In game theory, scientists have used repeated games--repeated interactions where individuals face the same social dilemma each time--to understand when individuals choose to cooperate, i.e. their strategies. However, these games have always kept the value of the public resource constant, no matter how players acted in the previous round--something that does not reflect reality of the situation. In their new framework, Hilbe, Simsa, Chatterjee, and Nowak consider repeated games in which cooperation does not only affect the players' present payoffs, but also which game they face in the next round. ""Repeated games have been studied intensely for over 40 years, and significant new developments are rare--especially such simple ones,"" says Martin Nowak. ""This addition actually extends the whole theory of repeated games, as a fixed environment is a special case of our new framework.""
When they explored the new model, the scientists found that this dependence on players' actions could greatly increase the chance that players cooperate--provided the right conditions were in place. ""Our framework shows which kinds of feedback are most likely to lead to cooperation,"" says first author Christian Hilbe. These include, for instance, how quickly the resource degrades or how easy it is to return to a more valuable state. ""Using this knowledge, you can design systems that maximize cooperation, or create an environment that encourages people to work together,"" he adds. For example, these ideas could even be implemented by a business or corporation, to create a work community that encourages working together.
The new research project also demonstrates how cooperations between fields of research can yield valuable results. ""Working with computer scientists has been extremely rewarding for me as a biologist,"" adds Nowak. ""The tools and perspectives they bring with them have had and will have a significant impact on what we can do."" The authors talk more about how this particular project came to be in their post on the Nature blog.

"A retail investor in Greek bonds who wants to sue Greece over a bond haircut in 2012 cannot invoke European Union rules to do so at home, an adviser to the EU’s top court said on Wednesday.
The case was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union by an Austrian court after Leo Kuhn, an Austrian who had bought 35,000 euros’ worth of Greek bonds, tried to sue Greece following a forced exchange into bonds with a lower value at the height of the Greek debt crisis in 2012.
His lawyers argued that under EU rules, he had the right to sue Greek authorities in Austria because the deal was a “civil and commercial matter” for which special rules applied.
Advocate General Yves Bot said this was not the case, as the forced exchange of bonds had happened in exceptional circumstances in which Greece faced default and the stability of the eurozone was at stake.
“Such a case is not a ‘civil or commercial’ matter for the purposes of that regulation,” said the advocate general, whose views are not binding but are usually followed by the court.

"A three-year US Securities and Exchange Commission investigation found that Dow Chemical failed to properly disclose around $3 million in perks for former chief executive Andrew Liveris, ranging from personal use of company aircraft to sporting events and dues Dow paid to a charity Liveris chaired.
Liveris, who led Dow for nearly 15 years, stepped down in April from the role of executive chairman at the newly combined chemicals giant DowDuPont Inc.
He retired as chairman and CEO of Dow effective Saturday, when he also left DowDuPont’s board.
Among the items flagged were personal vacations Liveris took with family using Dow aircraft, and Dow’s financial support for the Hellenic Initiative, a Greek charity Liveris had co-founded.

"Amid mounting concerns over the government’s survival after repeated threats by Independent Greeks (ANEL), the junior partner in the coalition, to withdraw over the Macedonia name deal, government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos sought to reassure reporters on Wednesday that it will complete its four-year term in office.
ANEL leader Panos Kammenos has said the deal must be ratified by an enhanced majority in Parliament or else his party will withdraw from the coalition.
Tzanakopoulos said that even though the Greek Constitution doesn’t require the deal to be ratified by an enhanced majority of 180 MPs in the 300-seat Parliament, the demand by Kammenos will be discussed.
“The Greek Constitution stipulates that the requirement for a majority of 180 lawmakers in support of any international agreement exists only when government powers or powers conferred by the Constitution to state agencies are ceded to international organizations. Here we do not have such a case, so there is no such constitutional requirement,” Tzanakopoulos said, adding however that the “political proposal” by Kammenos “will be the subject of discussion and consultation within the government when the time comes to make the necessary political decisions.”
The deal signed by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his counterpart from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Zoran Zaev, has sorely tested the coalition, which has a slim majority of 152 MPs.
Despite government efforts to defuse the tensions over the name issue, Interior Minister Panos Skourletis said yesterday that Kammenos’s remarks were dangerous for the stability of the government. Moreover, he added that ANEL is in competition with New Democracy for the same voters.
Referring to the possibility of ANEL leaving the coalition, he said that another parliamentary majority could be formed without the need for elections, adding that centrist To Potami could be a likely candidate.
According to reports on Wednesday from FYROM, Tsipras and Zaev may meet on the sidelines of the Western Balkans Summit in London on July 10.",www.ekathimerini.com,2018-07-07 00:00:00,9,422112
"Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos speaks during an interview with Reuters at his office in the Finance ministry in Athens, Greece, July 4, 2018. [Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters]
Greece has the capacity to finance itself unaided under a debt relief deal linked to its exit from an international bailout, but the agreement’s long-term fiscal targets may need reviewing, the country’s finance minister said.
As he prepares for meetings with investors in New York and Boston in coming days and in Asia in September, Euclid Tsakalotos said Greece had honored its promises to creditors.
The deal that euro zone finance ministers agreed in June to smooth next month’s exit from its third bailout offered clarity and reassurance to investors in Greece. That applied “whether we are talking about a 10-year government bond or whether we talk about foreign direct investment,” he told Reuters.
Tsakalotos took over in 2015 pledging to implement Greece’s third rescue package since 2010.
His euro zone counterparts agreed last month to extend maturities and defer interest payments on 96 billion euros worth of Greek debt, about one third of the country’s overall debt pile.
Greece has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the euro zone, at almost 180 percent of its national output.
“I had told them (potential investors) that all pieces of the puzzle would all come together ... and they did,” Tsakalotos said, referring to a previous trip to the United States.
“(This time)... I just want to go through with them their views, my views, on why we should be much more confident on Greece after the 21st of August when we leave the program.”
More debt relief?
Asked if Greece would need further debt relief to sustain market access and to be able to service its debt in the long run, as the International Monetary Fund suggested in a report last week, Tsakalotos said that a 2017 promise by European lenders to do more if needed was a further safety net.
“As things stand now and if we have serious government policy from now on, which has sustainable growth and does treat our growth strategy seriously... then I think everything is in place for sustainability,” he said.
He said the government’s goal was to tackle the debt burden through reforms and sustained higher growth as well as relief measures.
Greece has so far exceeded its fiscal targets. But the country has committed to implement more austerity in the next two years and achieve primary surpluses - which exclude debt-servicing costs - of 3.5 percent of GDP annually up to 2022, and 2.2 percent of GDP from 2023 to 2060.
The IMF called those targets “very ambitious”.
Tsakalotos said that the level austerity is much higher than he would like but the issue could be revisited in the long run.
“The fiscal surplus, if you ask me as an economist, is too high,” he said. “The European economies in general have got a framework which puts too much emphasis on fiscal austerity.
“The Greek government will look at this and so will the finance ministers, to see whether the IMF is right, whether there is a problem with sustainability. I mean it’s an empirical question, not an a priori (one).”
Greece is set to beat its targets again this year, giving it leeway to distribute a fiscal dividend to those who need it the most. Tsakalotos’ team will shortly propose where the extra funds should be spent.
He acknowledged there should be better fiscal targeting and that reducing income and property tax was under discussion. Greece wants to reinstate collective salary agreements and increase the minimum wage, and may also cut social security contributions, he said.
“What is the real problem...is who pays those taxes that’s what we will be concentrating on, that’s why I said that we were perhaps thinking of reducing social security contributions. Because there are clearly quite a lot of self-employed and small businesses, who have been hit both by an increase in taxes and social security.” [Reuters]",www.ekathimerini.com,2018-07-07 00:00:00,27,421944
"Many still believe that the tsunami of populism and nationalism which swept across Europe a few years ago left it largely untouched. Their optimism was sadly misplaced.
Marine Le Pen may have been defeated in France, but President Emmanuel Macron has yet to establish his role as a major political force with broader leadership qualities. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s power, meanwhile, is on the wane, causing significant concern because she was ultimately a bastion of common sense and moderation. From Hungary to Italy, the powers of defenders of extreme solutions to the immigration crisis and other issues are constantly gaining ground.
Citizens want clear proposals and leaders who don’t mince their words. They are laboring under the delusion that this style of governance will provide a solution to their problems. It turns out that anti-systemic sentiment ran a lot deeper than thought by those who were confident that Europe is strong enough to absorb all of the shocks rocking it.
But it is not just Europe that is being rocked. On the other side of the Atlantic, US President Donald Trump has been challenging – with his words and actions – the global status quo as this was shaped by the West in the aftermath of the Second World War. He is even picking a fight with Canada, his country’s closest and oldest ally. He claims that the European Union is more dangerous than China and is pressuring Macron to consider leaving the bloc. He wants to weaken NATO and destroy the World Trade Organization: the two main pillars of the global status quo. And no one can say whether this is all part of a plan.
After a brief period of respite, the rest of the Western world’s leaders need to ask themselves who the real voice of American politics is: Trump or what is left of the deep state?
History has taught us that whenever a superpower shrinks or shirks its role, something bad is going on. It is always something bad and something major, from a war to a major economic crisis.
It is hard right now to imagine where all this uncertainty and all these incredible changes will take us. For those of us who have always seen Europe as a safe haven from storms at home and abroad, the dark clouds gathering on the horizon are understandably causing grave concern, as we all feel that we are on the brink of a storm breaking out in the safe haven itself.",www.ekathimerini.com,2018-07-07 00:00:00,19,421977
"Not everyone in the European corridors of power agrees with the “flexible” viewpoint of Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs Pierre Moscovici on Greece meeting its pledges: In interviews on Wednesday the heads of the European Stability Mechanism and the Eurogroup were adamant that Greece must continue on the reform path and not go back on its promises.
On Tuesday Moscovici had claimed in Athens that while agreements must be adhered to, there could be some flexibility.
“Going back is really not an option,” Eurogroup chief Mario Centeno told Naftemporiki newspaper, responding to a question on the planned pension cuts. “I expect Greece will not deviate from its previous commitments and at the same time will use the range of political choices stemming from the exit from the program in a clever and responsible fashion,” he added.
Referring to Greece’s prospects of accessing the capital markets, Centeno said the key factor is sticking to fiscal discipline: “Market access is not an automatic blessing at the end of a program. You earn the confidence of the investors after several [bond] issues before the conclusion of a program and then build it up through reliable policies after the program.”
ESM head Klaus Regling warned that if Greece interrupts its reform course it will be punished by the markets as well as with the suspension of the debt-easing measures agreed.
In an interview with German daily Handelsblatt, Regling stressed that Athens is aware that “it will be under the permanent monitoring and assessment of the markets and the investors, just like the other countries that were in a program. What they want to know is if their money has been well and securely invested in the long term.”
Meanwhile former economy minister Evangelos Venizelos poignantly wondered in a radio interview on Athina 984 on Wednesday whether his former Eurogroup colleague Moscovici and the European Commission in general ought to ponder “if the encouragement and feeding of political buccaneering and extreme nationalist populism in member-states is in the Commission’s competences.”",www.ekathimerini.com,2018-07-07 00:00:00,8,422064

"Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Wednesday hailed the “new dynamic” that has developed in the Balkans in the last year that will enhance the regions’s prospects.
Speaking at the fourth Quadrilateral Summit in Thessaloniki between the leaders of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia, Tsipras said the positive outlook has been boosted by the recent name deal with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), and the European Union’s decisions to start accession talks with Serbia and Montenegro – and with Albania and FYROM next year.
He also expressed his support for the inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania in the Schengen Treaty.
In a parallel meeting, the infrastructure ministers of the four countries discussed ways to expedite infrastructure and energy projects in the region – namely rail links between Thessaloniki, Kavala, Alexandroupoli and Burgas, as well as the one connecting Thessaloniki, Skopje and Belgrade.
The IGB gas pipeline which will connect Greece and Bulgaria was also discussed, as well as the prospects of upgrading ports in northern Greece and the Black Sea.
Tsipras said this wide range of links will upgrade the significance of the western Balkans.
The Thessaloniki meeting is seen as an effort to coordinate the four countries’ positions on a number of key issues ahead of a meeting of the leaders of China and the countries of Eastern Europe and the Balkans in Sofia on Saturday and the Western Balkans Summit of the Berlin Process, which will be held in London next week.

"The rapidly growing home sharing market is the reason for the small increase in interest in taking out a mortgage in Greece.
That trend is confirmed by bank data that show about a 50 percent rise in mortgage applications and a 30 percent increase in savings in the first five months of 2018 compared to the same period last year.
Bank officials point out that the rise in mortgage applications is also due to the fact that the figure was much lower in 2017, as the market had been frozen for years, so the new demand does not translate into any great amount. Still, the figures reflect a trend seen not only in mortgage issues and applications but also in the questions bank branches handle.
Although the new housing loans pale in comparison with those of the past, amounting to just 40 million euros per month, banks perceive this as the first sign of recovery. The existing demand mainly concerns loans for house purchases, but data from banks also show a recent rise in demand for loans for home repairs, which account for 20-25 percent of new issues. This is attributed to the interest of many owners in renting out their property through short-term leasing platforms such as Airbnb and HomeAway.
That growth in interest explains moves by banks such as Alpha, which has launched a new product called “Alpha Home Renovation,” providing loans for home renovations through a few swift procedures.
As the properties leased out through the online platforms have to be in full working order and well-maintained, a number of landlords have taken out loans to renovate the properties they wish to list for home sharing.
It is no coincidence that sales of white goods have also shown an increase, which is helping to keep home appliance stores afloat.
A recent study by Grant Thornton for the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels showed that the total number of properties listed for home sharing is estimated at 42,155 across Greece, while the annual revenues from short-term rentals are estimated at 860 million euros.
Bank officials explain that landlords who live in their own properties are starting to take a look at renovation loans, as the majority resort to fixing their old home instead of buying a new one.",www.ekathimerini.com,2018-07-07 00:00:00,12,421959

"Pancake breakfast celebrates 52nd year

The sounds of “What I Like About You” drifted through the parking lot of Roger Dunn Golf Shop early Wednesday morning, accompanying the long line forming to get $5 pancakes and sausages cooked by the Santa Clarita Valley Rotary Club.
“J.C. and the Pancake Band,” has been a staple at the Rotary Club’s annual Fourth of July breakfast for the past nine years.
“It is no easy feat finding musicians willing to get up so early for an event that started at 6:30 a.m.,” said band leader J.C. Burnett. But, he added, as the band began a cover of “Mary Jane’s Last Dance” — this is an event that makes it worth it.
The breakfast has taken place at the golf shop building in Old Town Newhall for all of its 52-year run, said coordinator Chris Ball.
Usually, the servers plan for about 700 people each year, depending on the weather and the day of the week the holiday falls on. They may use anywhere between 150-175 pounds of batter, said Ball, head of the Rotary Club’s food committee for the last 13 years.
“This year, people haven’t left for the weekend because the Fourth was on a Wednesday,” he said. “And it’s a cool day, not too hot, so we’re expecting a good turnout.”
The breakfast club broke tradition when they decided to do grits this year, and when the club raised prices to $5, he said. But otherwise, there’s a lasting art to cooking the pancakes for this many people.
“If we don’t use enough water,” Ball said, pointing to the plates people held with two pancakes each, “We run out of batter. Like any good business, we need to stay ‘liquid.’”
First-timers also were welcome at the breakfast.
Nick Gontmaher, a 9-year Santa Clarita resident, said he ended up at the breakfast when he “followed the pack” on his way to view the parade that started at 9 a.m. He’d heard about it in previous years, but was just now getting to taste the goods.
“It’s a great way to kick off the Fourth of July,” he said.
Throughout the morning, SCV officials also stopped by decked out in patriotic colors.
Santa Clarita City Councilman Bob Kellar described the festivities as some of the best in Santa Clarita.
“The good thing about this is, it hasn’t changed,” he said. “The event does always get a few more people. But the quality of the pancakes never goes down.”
Councilman Bill Miranda agreed. “We’ve had a lot more community participation in recent years,” the 35-year attendee said. “We’re growing so large now, but it’s great to see us maintaining the old traditions.”
Kids milled around the event, as did dogs. Departing from his usual suit, 21st District Senator Scott Wilk greeted his constituents wearing a casual red shirt, while also tending to his two puppies, “Simi V.” and “A.V.”
“This breakfast is a longstanding tradition we do every year,” Wilk said, “and it’s one of the great events that makes Santa Clarita what it is.”",signalscv.com,2018-07-07 00:00:00,23,659778

Zonta Club of Santa Clarita Valley installed Debra Blakely as its new president for 2018-19, honored outgoing President Judy Penman and named super-active club member Darleen Lyons as Zontian of the Year at the group’s annual installation dinner recently at the Oaks Club in Valencia.
Lyons has served the club as club treasurer for eight years, was president in 1993 and 2006, and has served as both first and second vice presidents of the club. She also has been an active member of the Tribute, Lunafest and golf tournament committees, and was active in former club activities such as Rent-A-Santa, Healthy Woman’s Day and Healthy Kids Club.
On the Zonta International level, Lyons served as District 9 treasurer for four years and was a member of Zonta International’s Service Committee. She and her husband, Bill, have revitalized the Girls Robotics program that Zonta sponsors at the local Boys & Girls Club.
In the community, she has been an active supporter of the SCV Boys & Girls Club auction and science hours, AT&T Golf Tournament, host family for international students, SCV Senior Center’s Celebrity Waiter dinner, Wine Auction and Home Delivered Meals kitchen volunteer, American Red Cross, American Heart Association, and Downtown Newhall’s Western Walk of Fame. She has been named volunteer of the month for the Senior Center in 2016 and Volunteer of the Year for the Boys and Girls Club twice, in 1986 and 2015.
“A member since 1988, Darleen has been a committed Zontian—always at major fundraising events doing check-in for Zonta and (community) fundraising events,” says her nomination. “She is a member that gets things done. She does not complain and works efficiently behind the scenes. She truly loves Zonta and the community.”
Zontian of the Year is selected from member nominations. The final winner is selected not only for her leadership in Zonta, but also in the way she represents the club in the local community. The final selection committee is composed of former honorees.
Blakely was installed as Zonta president by installing officer Sharon Langenbeck, a Zonta International vice president and two-time recipient of Zonta’s Amelia Earhart Fellowship for women pursuing upper level degrees in aerospace and aeronautics–a member of the local club as well as an international dignitary. Blakely chose “Respecting the past and building our future” as her theme for the upcoming year.
Other officers and board members installed at the annual dinner include Barbara Meyer, president-elect; Beth Heiserman, first vice president/programs; Phyllis Walker, second vice president/membership; Adele Macpherson, treasurer; and Nell Campbell, secretary. Incoming and continuing directors include Sue Hayward, Terry Kanowsky, Ronnie Erickson, Alicia Estrada and Pat Warford. Newly installed Nominating Committee members are Darleen Lyons, Gloria Mercado-Fortine and Vicky Tungate.
The evening also served as installation for SCV Zonta Foundation trustees, who include Terry Kanowsky, Barbara Meyer, Christine Sexton, Susan Hayward, Nell Campbell, Francine Fiel, Cathy Gundy, Mary Ree, Judy Penman and Debra Blakely.
Outgoing President Judy Penman was saluted for the club’s outstanding accomplishments under her leadership in the 2017-18 club year. She noted that the SCV club is one of only two Zonta clubs in the world that have donated $50,000 or more to Zonta International during the current biennium. The club brought in $37,000 during the past year to support its service activities, even though the group abandoned its previous major fundraiser, the Tribute dinner.
Theme for Wednesday evening’s installation program was “Debra’s Mad Hatter Tea Party,” celebrating Blakely’s recurring role as hostess to club afternoon tea events. Following Zonta tradition, the installation dinner is organized by a committee composed of all of the club’s active past presidents, and is chaired by last year’s president. All past presidents also donated door prizes, which were awarded to guests throughout the evening.
One first-time addition to this year’s installation program was drawing for a Princess Cruise donated for the club’s fundraising efforts. Darleen Lyons’ ticket was the winner, making it a night of fulfilling surprises for the Zontian of the Year winner.",signalscv.com,2018-07-07 00:00:00,27,659819
"Mumbai: BJP lawmaker Kirit Somaiya today said that the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is likely to submit its preliminary report on the Ghatkopar plane crash in the next “few” days. Somaiya, who represents Mumbai north east parliamentary constituency in the Lok Sabha, also said that the full report is expected to take about six months.
Five people, four crew members including two pilots and a pedestrian, lost their lives when the 12-seater Beechcraft King Air C90 aircraft, belonging to private charter operator UY Aviation, crashed into an under-construction building in the busy Ghatkopar suburb of north east Mumbai on June 28 during a test flight.
bbThe AAIB, which is the apex aircraft investigation agency under the civil aviation ministry, has been entrusted with the probe. “Had meeting with DG Beer Singh Rai & his colleague of AAIB Delhi on Ghatkopar Airplane Crash. Preliminary report expected in few days, final report in 6 months,” Somaiya said in a tweet.
He also wanted to put to rest speculation that the aircraft, which had not flown for years did not have a certificate of airworthiness from the directorate of airworthiness under the directorate general of civil aviation. “Plane has test run certificate,” the BJP MP said in his tweet. Prabhat Kathuria, the husband of Marya Zuberi, the co-pilot who along with four others was killed in the incident, has publicly raised several questions over the test flight.
Kathuria, in a statement last week, wanted to know from the concerned authorities about “who allowed the flight to take off in the first place,” while citing DGCA norms that bars test flights of small planes in rainy weather. Meanwhile, in a related development, Kerala-based lawyer Yeshwanth Shenoy, who had filed a PIL in Bombay High Court seeking its intervention on height norm violations by constructions around the Mumbai airport, has sough a CBI probe into the plane crash besides appointment of a court of inquiry.
In a letter to the civil aviation minister today, Shenoy said, “I have filed a police complaint…I request you to ensure that the investigation by the DGCA officials be immediately stopped and the central government appoints a court of inquiry as was done after the Mangalore plane crash.”
“As regards the criminal investigation is concerned, the same be transferred to the CBI as the state police is inadequately equipped to conduct investigation related to an aircrash,” he said in the letter.
He also demanded grounding of the entire fleet of planes and choppers being maintained by the the MRO services provider Indamer Aviation, till investigation is completed.

"A new study in The Condor: Ornithological Applications presents negative associations between anthropogenic disturbance (human recreational use of beaches, coastal modifications) and Piping Plovers on their non-breeding grounds. Shorebirds are one of the most threatened bird families in the world. Numerous studies have shown the negative impacts of humans on these birds, whether it be large-scale (e.g., habitat loss, climate change) or small-scale (e.g., ATV use, running with pets, flying kites). This research indicates that there are direct consequences of disturbance. Most Piping Plover research has focused on the breeding season in an attempt to directly influence population numbers, however this study argues that efforts are required throughout the year in all locations to assist Piping Plover conservation.
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University's Dan Gibson and colleagues monitored Piping Plovers year-round to determine the health and behavior of individuals. Body condition, survival, and site fidelity were of most interest. Plovers in disturbed areas proved to be significantly lighter in mass, due to the birds not procuring enough food. Given poorer body condition, it should be no surprise that birds in these disturbed areas also had lower survival rates. Piping plovers have strong site fidelity on the breeding grounds and this study supports that fidelity continues on the non-breeding grounds. While physically capable of changing location, it was not common for individuals to do so even if there was a high level of disturbance. The lack of movement by disturbed individuals suggests that aspects of the species' life history (i.e. fidelity) constrained individuals to make seemingly adaptive habitat-use decisions. Some of the strategies used on the breeding grounds (reduced human recreation, roped-off areas, no dogs on beaches) may be beneficial to also do on the non-breeding grounds to ensure year-round conservation and oversight on this threatened shorebird species.
Lead author Dan Gibson comments, ""We have a lot of of opportunity to engage with the public in what exactly our research is about. We often try to stress that the impact an individual recreationist has on a shorebird is practically non-existent. However, if every person who uses a beach in a given day influences how these shorebirds feed or rest, those minute impacts can begin to add up over the course of a season that can manifest itself as reductions in individual body condition and ultimately their ability to withstand bad weather conditions or successfully migrate and find a mate. We try to stress that small changes in how we use a beach (e.g., keep dogs on leash, avoid running through groups of birds) can really add up to substantial improvements in the overall quality of coastal habitat for shorebirds.""
""This study availed itself of a unique resource that range-wide banding efforts have provided for the study of the demographics of the endangered piping plover,"" adds College of Environmental Science and Forestry Associate Professor Jonathan Cohen, a shorebird expert who was not involved with the research, ""and successfully attempted the difficult task of teasing out the sometimes subtle effect of disturbance in nonbreeding areas on annual vital rates. The finding that this endangered species may not readily abandon habitat that is detrimental for fitness was surprising, and warrants immediate attention from the conservation community.""

"A study from The Auk: Ornithological Advances presents citizen science data which supports that American Crows and Northwestern Crows almost exclusively (97% of the time) instigate any aggressive interactions with Common Ravens no matter where in North America. The data showed that aggression by crows was most frequent during the breeding season, most likely due to nest predation by ravens. This study not only gives insight into interspecies dynamics, but also how citizen science data can aid behavioral studies at large geographic scales.
Cornell University's Ben Freeman and colleagues used more than 2,000 publicly collected and submitted observations from across North America via eBird to analyze the interspecific aggression between crows (American and Northwestern) and Common Ravens. From these records, it was determined that crows were the predominant aggressor. Crows primarily attacked in small groups rather than one-on-one confrontations with ravens. The breeding season was when most of the attack observations were made, suggesting that nest predation by ravens influences this behavior. Aggression during the winter is potentially explained by crows preemptively deterring nest predation and defending resources needed for nesting later in the year. This study was made possible by citizen scientists who were not even asked to submit such observations. Given this was passively collected data that aided in a behavioral study on a large geographic area, it could act as a model for other research and potential studies conducted.
Lead author Ben Freeman comments, ""There are two take-home messages. First, we show that bigger birds do not always dominate smaller birds in aggressive interactions, and that social behavior may allow smaller birds to chase off larger birds. Second, this is a case example of the power of citizen science. It would be next to impossible for even the most dedicated researcher to gather this data across North America. But because there are thousands of people with expertise in bird identification and an interest in bird behavior, we can use data from eBird to study behavioral interactions on a continental scale.""
""Given that aggression between crows and ravens can be quite conspicuous, birders and the general public are often the observers of such interactions,"" adds Kaeli Swift, who was not involved with the research, ""yet despite the ease and frequency of witnessing these events, there was little scientific information for curious minds to turn to for explanation. It's quite rewarding then, that the citizen scientists that may have wished for this information are the very people whose observations made this publication possible.

"Barcelona, 4 July 2018: The inclusion of nuts in a regular diet significantly improves the quality and function of human sperm, according to results of a randomised trial which measured conventional semen parameters and molecular changes over a 14-week study period. The findings, say the investigators, ""support a beneficial role for chronic nut consumption in sperm quality"" and reflect a research need for further male-specific dietary recommendations.
The results of the study are presented today by Dr Albert Salas-Huetos from the Human Nutrition Unit of the Universitat Rovira i Virgil in Reus, Spain.(1)
The study was performed, he said, against a background of general decline in quantity and quality of human sperm, attributed in industrialised countries to ""pollution, smoking, and trends toward a western-style diet"".(2) In this study subjects randomised to the nut group had significant improvements in their sperm count, vitality, motility and morphology (shape); these were consistent with improvements found in other recent studies with diets rich in omega-3, antioxidants (eg, vitamin C and E, selenium and zinc), and folate. Nuts are dense foods containing many of these nutrients and other phytochemicals.
The study was a 14-week randomised clinical trial in which 119 healthy young men aged 18-35 were allocated to either their usual western-style diet supplemented with 60 grams/day of mixed almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts, or their usual western-style diet without nuts. In its analysis the study recorded not just sperm parameters (according to WHO benchmarks) but also changes in several molecular factors, including sperm DNA fragmentation.(3) Sperm and blood samples were analysed at baseline and after 14 weeks of intervention.
Results firstly found significantly higher levels of sperm count, vitality, motility and morphology in the men randomised to the 60 g/day nut diet than in those following their usual diets free of nuts. Improvements in the former group were by around 16% in sperm count, 4% in sperm vitality, 6% in sperm motility, and 1% in morphology. These four parameters, explained Salas-Huetos, are all associated with male fertility. Moreover, the subjects in the nut group also showed a significant reduction in their levels of sperm DNA fragmentation, a parameter closely associated with male infertility. Indeed, it was this change in the level of DNA fragmentation in the sperm cells by which the investigators explained, at least in part, the improvement in sperm count, motility and morphology.
Although these are statistically significant results from a randomised trail with a high level of scientific evidence, Salas-Huetos emphasised that subjects in the study were all healthy and apparently fertile men following a western-style diet. He thus warned that results cannot be extrapolated to the general population.
So should men hoping to conceive a baby - either naturally or with IVF - add nuts to their everyday diet? ""We can't yet say that,"" said Salas-Huetos, ""based solely on the results of this study. But evidence is accumulating in the literature that healthy lifestyle changes such as following a healthy dietary pattern might help conception - and of course, nuts are a key component of a Mediterranean healthy diet.""

Abstract O-238, Wednesday 4 July 2018
Effect of nut consumption on semen quality and functionality in healthy males: a randomized controlled trial
Notes
1. This was a collaborative study led by Dr Mònica Bulló from the Rovira i Virgili University and Drs Joan Blanco and Ester Anton from the Autonomous University of Barcelona. The study was funded by the International Nut and Dried Food Council.
2. There remains some controversy over a decline in sperm counts in developed countries, mainly because of how the measurements were taken. However, a huge meta-analysis last year reported ""a significant decline in sperm counts between 1973 and 2011"". The analysis, which included more than 40,000 men whose semen samples were screened in 244 studies, found the results ""driven by a 50-60% decline among men unselected by fertility from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand"". The decline in sperm concentration was put at -1.4% per year and in total sperm count at -1.6% per year. (See Levine H, Jørgensen N, Martino-Andrade A, et al. Temporal trends in sperm count: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis. Hum Reprod Update 2017; 23: 646-659.)
3. The World Health Organization lists four semen quality parameters in its latest manual of 2010: concentration (ie, count, which should be a minimum of 15 million sperm cells per ml semen); progressive motility (32% minimum); vitality (58%); and morphology (4%). These are the main parameters measured to evaluate semen quality within a normal range. At the molecular level it has also been proposed that the genetic integrity of each sperm cell is essential for successful fertilisation; if DNA strands in the cell become damaged or fragmented, they will be unable or less likely to fertilise an egg and maintain embryonic development. It is believed that this DNA fragmentation is caused by oxidative stress as a result of environmental and lifestyle factors. Sperm DNA fragmentation can be tested by a range of assays.

"Electronic radio tags could be used to track invasive Asian hornets and stop them colonising the UK and killing honeybees, new research shows.
Scientists from the University of Exeter attached tiny tags to Asian hornets, then used a tracking device to follow them to their nests; the first time this has been achieved.
They tested the technique in southern France and Jersey - where Asian hornets are well established - and the tags led researchers to five previously undiscovered nests.
""Our new method of tracking offers a really important new tool to tackle the spread of this invader, providing an efficient means of finding hornets' nests in urban, rural and wooded environments,"" said lead researcher Dr Peter Kennedy, of the Environment and Sustainability Institute on the University of Exeter's Penryn Campus in Cornwall.
Asian hornets prey on honeybees and other pollinators, and the scientists say the technique demonstrated in their study could help protect Britain's ""beleaguered pollinator populations"".
""It is vital to find the nests early in the season to prevent the hornet spreading, as later in the year hundreds of new queens emerge and disperse from each nest, each with the potential to make new nests,"" said Professor Juliet Osborne, a co-author on the study, and Director of the Environment and Sustainability Institute.
The work was funded as part of Defra's efforts to prepare for future outbreaks of the Asian hornet in the UK.
South West beekeepers also saw the urgency of the work, supporting it with their own funds.
Nicola Spence, Defra Deputy Director for Plant and Bee Health, said: ""This work is key for ensuring a rapid response to Asian hornets when sightings are confirmed, and in future bee inspectors will be able to use this technique to take swift action.""
""In France, the Asian hornet is unlikely to be eliminated, so efforts are now focussed more on limiting their impact,"" said Dr Denis Thiéry from INRA Bordeaux-Aquitaine in France, who collaborated on this work.
Mr Willie Peggie, Director of The States of Jersey Department of the Environment, where the technique was also tested, said: ""We are pleased to be investigating efficient methods of tracking Asian hornets to their nests, as we're concerned about their impact on our wild insect pollinators, as well as their effect on local honey production.""
The researchers used the smallest radio tags available - made by UK firm Biotrack Ltd - and attached them to hornets with sewing thread. Hornets were able to carry them as long as the tag weighed less than 80% of the insect's weight.
Asian hornets are the latest threat to Britain's honeybees, which - like many pollinators - are suffering due to factors including habitat loss, parasites and pesticides.
The British Beekeepers Association are also pleased about the development of a reliable technique for tracking this invasive predator, and stated: ""The BBKA are greatly concerned about the possible incursion by the Asian Hornet because of the devastation likely to be caused to honeybees and other pollination insects.""
Adult Asian hornets ""hawk"" at beehives, meaning that they hover outside to grab bees, before dismembering them and taking them back to their nest to feed to larvae.
The first Asian hornet discovered in Britain was in Gloucestershire in 2016, when a nest was found and destroyed. Another nest was destroyed in Woolacombe, Devon, last year. In April this year, a single hornet was found in Lancashire.
Asian hornets are smaller than native European hornets, have a largely dark brown or black body and yellow-tipped legs, a distinctive orange-yellow stripe near the end of their abdomen, and often a thin orange-yellow line just behind the ""waist"". Their face is orange, and the back of the head is black, unlike the European hornet in which both the face and back of the head are yellow.
Any suspected sighting of an Asian hornet should be reported, ideally with a photo, via email to alertnonnative@ceh.ac.uk or by using the Asian Hornet Watch app.
The paper, published in the journal Communications Biology, is entitled: ""Searching for nests of the invasive Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) using radio-telemetry.""

"New York City -- An international team of astronomers has discovered an ancient and dramatic head-on collision between the Milky Way and a smaller object, dubbed the ""Sausage"" galaxy. The cosmic crash was a defining event in the early history of the Milky Way and reshaped the structure of our galaxy, fashioning both its inner bulge and its outer halo, the astronomers report in a series of new papers.
The astronomers propose that around 8 billion to 10 billion years ago, an unknown dwarf galaxy smashed into our own Milky Way. The dwarf did not survive the impact: It quickly fell apart, and the wreckage is now all around us.
""The collision ripped the dwarf to shreds, leaving its stars moving in very radial orbits"" that are long and narrow like needles, said Vasily Belokurov of the University of Cambridge and the Center for Computational Astrophysics at the Flatiron Institute in New York City. The stars' paths take them ""very close to the centre of our galaxy. This is a telltale sign that the dwarf galaxy came in on a really eccentric orbit and its fate was sealed.""
The new papers in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, The Astrophysical Journal Letters and arXiv.org outline the salient features of this extraordinary event. Several of the papers were led by Cambridge graduate student GyuChul Myeong. He and colleagues used data from the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite. This spacecraft has been mapping the stellar content of our galaxy, recording the journeys of stars as they travel through the Milky Way. Thanks to Gaia, astronomers now know the positions and trajectories of our celestial neighbours with unprecedented accuracy.
The paths of the stars from the galactic merger earned them the moniker ""the Gaia Sausage,"" explained Wyn Evans of Cambridge. ""We plotted the velocities of the stars, and the sausage shape just jumped out at us. As the smaller galaxy broke up, its stars were thrown onto very radial orbits. These Sausage stars are what's left of the last major merger of the Milky Way.""
The Milky Way continues to collide with other galaxies, such as the puny Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. However, the Sausage galaxy was much more massive. Its total mass in gas, stars and dark matter was more than 10 billion times the mass of our sun. When the Sausage crashed into the young Milky Way, its piercing trajectory caused a lot of mayhem. The Milky Way's disk was probably puffed up or even fractured following the impact and would have needed to regrow. And Sausage debris was scattered all around the inner parts of the Milky Way, creating the 'bulge' at the galaxy's centre and the surrounding 'stellar halo.'
Numerical simulations of the galactic mashup can reproduce these features, said Denis Erkal of the University of Surrey. In simulations run by Erkal and colleagues, stars from the Sausage galaxy enter stretched-out orbits. The orbits are further elongated by the growing Milky Way disk, which swells and becomes thicker following the collision.
Evidence of this galactic remodelling is seen in the paths of stars inherited from the dwarf galaxy, said Alis Deason of Durham University. ""The Sausage stars are all turning around at about the same distance from the centre of the galaxy."" These U-turns cause the density in the Milky Way's stellar halo to decrease dramatically where the stars flip directions. This discovery was especially pleasing for Deason, who predicted this orbital pileup almost five years ago. The new work explains how the stars fell into such narrow orbits in the first place.
The new research also identified at least eight large, spherical clumps of stars called globular clusters that were brought into the Milky Way by the Sausage galaxy. Small galaxies generally do not have globular clusters of their own, so the Sausage galaxy must have been big enough to host a collection of clusters.
""While there have been many dwarf satellites falling onto the Milky Way over its life, this was the largest of them all,"" said Sergey Koposov of Carnegie Mellon University, who has studied the kinematics of the Sausage stars and globular clusters in detail.

In http://adsabs. harvard. edu/ abs/ 2018MNRAS. 478. . 611B , the authors describe the local evidence but also outline explicitly and precisely what sort of event this was and how much debris it could contribute to the inner Milky Way halo. The researchers also analyse cosmological simulations to pin down the mass and the time of the accretion and point out that it may have produced the thick disk.
In http://adsabs. harvard. edu/ abs/ 2018arXiv180510288D , the authors point out that the deposits of stellar debris from this event have similar apocenters and are naturally responsible for the stellar halo break.
In http://adsabs. harvard. edu/ abs/ 2018arXiv180500453M , the authors demonstrate that this merger has brought a large number of globular clusters into the Milky Way, and that these stand out clearly from the rest of the galactic population.
In http://adsabs. harvard. edu/ abs/ 2018ApJ. . . 856L. . 26M , the authors point to the evidence for this merger in the distribution of actions and also highlight the existence of the large retrograde spray of debris.

"New research provides insights into the extinction of Britain's largest native carnivore.
The study - 'The Presence of the brown bear in Holocene Britain: a review of the evidence' published in Mammal Review - is the first of its kind to collate and evaluate the evidence for the brown bear in post-Ice Age Britain.
Previous research has failed to establish when the brown bear became extinct, and whether or not remains that have been found are of wild native bears or of bears that have been imported from overseas. There is also little evidence to determine why the bear became extinct on British shores.
The author of the paper, Dr Hannah O'Regan from the Department of Classics and Archaeology at the University of Nottingham, says: ""The brown bear was Britain's largest carnivore, yet we know surprisingly little about its history, both as a wild animal and in its relation to humans.
""There has never been a comprehensive review of the evidence of brown bears in Britain, and I believe what we are looking at could show that they were sadly killed off earlier than we previously thought.""
Dr O'Regan has examined the location of the sites where materials have previously been found, the dating evidence and the body parts present, to determine when the bear became extinct and where it was imported from other countries.
""Previous extinction evidence is unclear and I would suggest two scenarios should be considered - that they became extinct in the late Neolithic or Bronze Age, or, in the early medieval period.
""Most of the remains that have been discovered from the Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon (early medieval) periods relate to skins that were included in burials,"" says Dr O'Regan.
""Whilst there were live animals present during the Roman, medieval and post-medieval periods (when they were used for entertainment), these were most certainly imported, rather than native animals.""
Interpretations of where animals were living can be affected by the use of data from archaeological sites where their remains may have come from several different sources.
For example, determining when wild animals were present in the past is not straight forward, particularly when dealing with the brown bear where furs and live animals were moved and traded over huge distance and over long periods.
The remains of bears in Britain range from full skeletons to isolated toes or claws, and the sites range from caves to human cremations.
""At present the question of when and why the brown bear became extinct is impossible to answer, as there is still much that we don't know about its distribution. There are 57 sites across Britain where clear dates have been determined, but there are an additional 25 that are thought to be Holocene, but have no further information.
""There is also a gap in radiocarbon dates of some 4000 years from the Mesolithic to the Bronze Age. Some of this gap is filled with specimens from archaeological sites, but further research is needed to establish bear distribution in the past.
""Whilst we can speculate on when the bear became extinct based on existing evidence, more research, particularly on the many undated specimens from caves and fens is needed before a clearer patterns of where brown bear distribution and extinction in Britain emerges,""

"The Auk: Ornithological Advances presents a study on a Northern Spotted Owl pedigree, consisting of almost 14,200 individuals over 30 years, which determined inbreeding varies across the species' range. Selection against inbreeding based on decreased future reproduction, fewer offspring, and overall survival of individuals was also supported. These results indicate that Spotted Owl conservation efforts need to address owl breeding more. Another implication of this work is the need to increase genetic diversity to prevent further population decline.
Mark Miller of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center, and colleagues employed field and statistical methods to create a family tree for Northern Spotted Owls living in California, Oregon, and Washington. From this, the researchers determined how often inbreeding occurs in the wild for these birds. Fourteen types of matings among relatives were determined with most inbreeding relationships being between half or full siblings. It was discovered that inbreeding is most common in the Washington Cascades (~15% of individuals are inbred), while the lowest inbred population was Northern California (~2.7% of individuals). The explanation for this geographic variation may be the rate at which specific populations are declining and experiencing bottlenecks. Conservation efforts are vital today given that Northern Spotted Owls are already facing habitat loss and competition with a similar species, the Barred Owl. This study showed that both the physical consequences of inbreeding (physical deformities, reduced ability to adapt) and the reproductive fitness of individual birds (infertility, future reproduction, decreased survival) need to be taken into account since both influence this species' success. Translocating birds among populations to help increase the genetic diversity may be a potential management strategy.
Lead author Mark Miller comments, ""Long-term studies, similar to the one described in this paper, are key to understanding how common or rare inbreeding is in natural populations. An understanding of the extent of inbreeding can help resource managers better identify appropriate measures to conserve threatened and endangered species.""

"A demand by Greece’s junior coalition partner that the name deal with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) be ratified by a supermajority in Greece’s parliament is not dictated by the country’s constitution and will be addressed when the “time comes,” the spokesman for the leftist-led government said on Wednesday.
Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said the government will discuss a demand for the deal with Skopje to be scrapped unless it can get backing from 180 lawmakers made by Panos Kammenos, Greece’s defense minister and head of the tiny nationalist Independent Greeks party – on which the government’s slim majority of 153 MPs in the 300-seat House relies.
“The Greek Constitution stipulates that the need for a vote of 180 lawmakers in support of any international agreement exists only when government powers or powers conferred by the Constitution are ceded to state agencies in international organizations. Here we do not have such a case, so there is no such constitutional requirement,” Tzanakopoulos said.

"A retail investor in Greek bonds who wants to sue Greece over a bond haircut in 2012 cannot invoke EU rules to do so at home, an adviser to the EU’s top court said on Wednesday.
The case was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union by an Austrian court after Leo Kuhn, an Austrian who had bought 35,000 euros ($40,775.00) worth of Greek bonds, tried to sue Greece following a forced exchange into bonds with a lower value at the height of the Greek debt crisis in 2012.
His lawyers argued that under EU rules, he had the right to sue Greek authorities in Austria because the deal was a “civil and commercial matter” for which special rules applied.
Advocate General Yves Bot said this was not the case, as the forced exchange of bonds had happened in exceptional circumstances in which Greece faced default and the stability of the eurozone was at stake.

"Eurogroup chief Mario Centeno does not expect Greece to deviate from its commitments to international creditors as it exits the bailout, dampening hopes in Athens of a certain amount of leeway once the final bailout ends in August.
“I expect Greece not to deviate from previous commitments and, at the same time, to use the scope of policy options that arise from the program exit in a smart and responsible way,” the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers told Naftemporiki daily in an interview published on Wednesday.
“Going back is not really an option,” he said when asked to comment on suggestions by the government that it will reduce the scope of planned cuts to pensions and other measures.
Centeno, who is also the finance minister of Portugal which left its program four years, said that Greece can learn from his country on how to gradually reduce income tax without harming competitiveness or fiscal consolidation but also on how staying the course yields results.
“Market access is not an automatic blessing at the end of a program,” he said. “You earn investors’ trust after several issuances before the end of the program and then you build it up with credible policies after the program.”
The Eurogroup president also defended the agreement reached last month between Greece and its creditors for measures to lighten the country’s debt pile but also for strict post-bailout supervision.
“Enhanced surveillance in the post-program phase will help Greece to chart its economic path in a credible way,” Centeno told Naftemporiki. “Credible for the European creditors, which have a large stake in Greece; credible for the markets, whose confidence is critical.”

Speaking to Germany’s Handelsblatt, Regling said that the leftist party’s victory in January 2015 was a setback at a time when and end to the recession appeared to be in sight. Greece, he said, “embarked on a wrong path for six months, costing the Greeks billions.”
However, he added, efforts started once Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras agreed to a fresh austerity program in exchange for additional assistance are now bearing fruit, thanks to “profound and painful structural reforms.”
“Since 2016, the country whose deficit stood at 15 percent of economic output in 2009, is consistently at a black zero,” Regling said.
Greece, said the ESM chief, was a tougher challenge than other euro areas countries that needed to be bailout out like Portugal and Cyprus, because in “no other program country were the problems so great and the administration as weak.”
Despite some similarities between the five program countries, he said, all the structural weaknesses in Greece were “one size bigger.”
Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus were able to complete their aid programs after three years and Spain only needed 18 months, Regling said. “By contrast, the Greek patient spent more than eight years in the intensive care unit.”",www.ekathimerini.com,2018-07-06 00:00:00,5,422022
"Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias said Greece and Turkey should first come to an agreement on the aspects of security and guarantees, before a new Conference on Cyprus is convened.
Speaking on radio station Sto Kokkino in Greece, the minister said Athens had previously underlined the need for such an agreement before the parties met in Geneva and subsequently in Crans Montana last year.
The foreign minister pointed fingers at the former UN special advisor, Espen Barth Eide, saying the Norwegian diplomat was the reason that preparatory work on Greece’s proposal had been left incomplete.
As a result, security and guarantees were discussed inter-connectedly with all other issues but the parties could not agree on a way forward.
This is not the first time the Greek government has put forth such a proposal.
Kotzias has spoken against military troops and guarantees in a post-solution Cyprus, saying his country did not wish to remain a guarantor power and calling on Turkey and Britain, the other two guarantors based on a 1960 agreement, to give up similar claims.
Greek Cypriots consider Turkish guarantees an anathema to their community, arguing that such an arrangement is anachronistic and unfitting for a modern EU member state.
Turkish Cypriots, on the other hand, argue that Turkey should remain a guarantor power, citing fears to their own security as the smaller community on the island.
Cyprus has been divided by ethnic conflict for over half a century and it was further split in two in July 1974, when Turkey intervened by invading the northern part of the island, several days following a short-lived military coup engineered by Athens.
An attempt to reunify the island under a bicommunal, bizonal, federal system failed in a referendum in April 2004, days before the Republic of Cyprus joined the European Union.
Turkish Cypriots overwhelmingly voted in favour hoping a reunified country would be their ticket to coming out of the shadows of a breakaway regime, recognised only by Turkey.
But Greek Cypriots voted against the plan, citing fears that Turkey was not to be trusted.
A new UN effort to ascertain whether a new conference could be possible is underway this month. [Kathimerini Cyprus]",www.ekathimerini.com,2018-07-06 00:00:00,14,422147

"It is said that Sir Steven Runciman fell in love with the Byzantine Empire as a young man in 1929, while on the deck of the family yacht. Looking out to Monemvasia on the eastern coast of the Peloponnese, he saw the castle town’s walls and churches from afar and felt a strong affinity toward Greece.
This affinity lasted his entire life and compelled him to study Byzantine history and bring it out of international obscurity. He taught, wrote and forged friendships with important Greek literary figures, such as Giorgos Seferis and Angelos Sikelianos, becoming an important bridge between Greek and British culture.
Today, one of the most respected awards in this field carries his name.
The Runciman Award was conceived in 1986 by the Anglo-Hellenic League, which was founded in 1913. In charge of this association is an individual particularly loved in Greece: John Kittmer, the former British ambassador to Athens, who was recently succeeded by Kate Smith.
The Runciman Award aims to showcase English-speaking publications that concern some aspect of Greece or the world of Hellenism. Past winners include highly respected writers such as historian Mark Mazower and Roderick Beaton, Koraes Professor of Modern Greek and Byzantine History, Language and Literature at King’s College London. The award’s prestige is also reflected in the caliber of its committee. Led by Dr John Penney (Wolfson College), the panel included Dionysis Kapsalis (director of the National Bank of Greece Cultural Foundation), Dr Stavroula Pipyrou (lecturer in the Department of Social Anthropology at St Andrews University) and Peter Frankopan (professor of International History at Oxford).
This year the judges had the difficult task of picking a winner from among 47 entries, with publications ranging from academic research to books aimed at wider audiences. The short-listed nominees were announced in April and the prizewinning ceremony took place last month at the Hellenic Center in London. The award was shared between two publications: “Classical Greek Oligarchy” by Matthew Simonton (Princeton University Press) and “House of Names” by Colm Toibin (Penguin/Viking). The awards were presented by Prince Michael of Kent, alongside Dimitris Paraskevas of Elias Paraskevas Attorneys, which provided the 10,000-pound award.
“This year’s competition was remarkable, with excellent books submitted and short-listed. The strong field reflects the high quality of current writing in English about Hellenism and its many guises,” Kittmer said.
“The fascination of Greece, Greek history and Greek culture evidently remains undimmed, amongst scholars and laypersons alike, as this year’s splendidly varied submissions for the Runciman Award clearly attest,” said Penney.
“Given the overall quality of the field, all the short-listed books earned warm congratulations for their authors, and the judges had a hard time deciding between them… We decided to divide the prize this year between two books of quite different kinds,” the panel’s head added.
Other notable guests at the ceremony were Greek diplomat Dimitris Caramitsos-Tziras, High Commissioner of Cyprus to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Euripides Evriviades, Archbishop Gregory of Thyateira and Great Britain, and Lord and Lady Butler of Brockwell. Former director of the British Museum Neil MacGregor was one of the speakers.

"Maradona feels referee favored England and robbed Colombia
Argentine football legend Diego Maradona has criticised the referee who officiated the World Cup Round of 16 game involving England and Colombia yesterday.
England beat Colombia on penalties in a pulsating encounter to qualify for the quarter-finals of the competition yesterday, as the game had ended 1-1 in normal time after Yerry Mina had cancelled out a Harry Kane opener.
In an interview that Maradona gave to Venezuelan outlet De La Mano Del Diez, he said that the American referee yesterday favored England and should judge baseball games.
He said: "" Colombia suffered a monumental robbery. The referee Geiger. who is American will know the rules of baseball, certainly not those of football. He's a thief. It was Kane's foul and instead, he gave it against the Colombians.""
"" Why did not he ask for the Var's intervention? We must apologize to the Colombian people. The referees were chosen by Collina, who was in turn nominated by Infantino who was supposed to free FIFA from corruption and thieves. But in this game we saw the opposite. I was moved when he told me that he would free FIFA from rotting.""

"SAINT-MARS-LA-REORTHE, France (AP) — Chris Froome has asked Tour de France fans to let him race in peace, even if they doubt the recent ruling that cleared him of doping allegations.
The British cyclist has been targeted by spectators in the past. During the 2015 Tour, he said a man threw a cup of urine at him while yelling ""doper"".
With the latest edition beginning on Saturday, five days after the International Cycling Union finally ruled Froome had won last year's Spanish Vuelta cleanly, the four-time Tour winner offered an alternative way for skeptical fans to show their distrust.
""Support the race in a positive way, don't bring negativity,"" he said on Wednesday in western France. ""In terms of safety I obviously would encourage fans of the sport to come watch the race, and if you are not necessarily a Chris Froome fan or a Sky fan, come to the race and put a jersey on of another team you do support. That would be my advice.""
A cloud hung over Froome after a urine sample taken during the Vuelta in September showed a concentration of the asthma drug salbutamol that was twice the permitted level.
After months of silence, the UCI said Froome's result did not represent an adverse finding, which could have led him to be stripped of his Vuelta victory, and a suspension.
The UCI's ruling ensured he could compete at the Tour after race organizer ASO had informed Team Sky it would forbid Froome from entering until the doping case was decided.
His use of asthma medication has been well documented and he often uses inhalers during races. World Anti-Doping Agency rules state an athlete can be cleared for excessive salbutamol use if he proves it was due to an appropriate therapeutic dosage.
Froome said he understands it may take time for fans to believe he is not a cheat.
""But that data is available, and I would like to think that as people understand that more, they will understand my decision to keep on racing knowing I have certainly done nothing wrong,"" Froome said. ""Of course it has been damaging. As it is right now I'm just happy to draw a line in the sand and move on and focus on bike racing.""
UCI president David Lappartient has also issued a call for calm.
""(Froome) has the right to operate in a safe environment. I have heard calls, sometimes completely irrational, to violence on the Tour de France,"" Lappartient said. ""I cannot accept that and I call on all spectators to protect all the athletes and to respect the judicial decision so that Chris Froome can compete in a safe and serene environment.""
Teammate Geraint Thomas said Froome has shown poise even when fans are at their worst.
""I've always been impressed by the way he is off the bike,"" Thomas said. ""But the last nine months have been the most impressive, really, how he was able to still perform and train and commit to all that while everything else was going on.""
Thomas, however, said possible run-ins with the public are part of riding down roads lined by people, most of who are there to cheer on the athletes.
""It's not like football — it's not in just a closed stadium when you can check everyone,"" he said. ""So there is that element of risk so to speak.""
Froome is aiming to join Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain as the only riders to win the Tour five times.

"RATEPAYERS have been committed to $18 million in borrowings over the next two years to help fund the Brisbane Road carpark redevelopment.
However after failing to answer questions put yesterday Sunshine Coast Council has announced a press conference for this morning with indications the deal with the Sydney-based Abacus Property Group may be now in doubt.
The borrowings would have been in addition to the community providing Abacus with the land for an approved multi-purpose residential, resort, retirement, retail and hotel project.
Sunshine Coast Council budget papers reveal borrowings in 2019 of $16 million towards the car park with a further $2 million scheduled for 2020.
The amounts were contained in the budget's Schedule of External Borrowings.
The borrowing schedule noted the council operated a central treasury model and as such did not ""generally provide debt funding for specific projects or assets but rather uses debt funding to finance council's balance sheet, with the exception being for strategic projects"".
The council in return would receive 704 car parking spaces as part of the redevelopment for which it would charge as yet undetermined fees.
The existing carpark provided 179 spaces meaning the development would create a net gain of 525 spaces not discounting demand the new commercial uses of the site would create.
Much of the 6778sq m site was acquired through resumptions in the early 1990s that forced early settlers out of their homes.
Phil Jobson, whose family's home was one of those resumed, said their elderly neighbours had all died within a few short years of being moved from familiar surroundings.
The land was valued at $14.5m as a car park in the council's asset register at June 30, 2017.
That followed a November 22, 2016, valuation by Savills which has yet to be released but was believed to be in the order of $18m.
Valuers have told the Sunshine Coast Daily that two major amendments to the planning scheme for Mooloolaba last year combined with a stronger market would have pushed its real value to in the order of $25 million, a number that has been dismissed by Mayor Mark Jamieson.
However council CEO Michael Whittaker has refused a request from peak residents' group OSCAR to release even the 2016 valuation saying he would only do so with the consent of the valuer (Savills) and the developer.
He has acknowledged a fresh valuation had taken into account the new use of the site the council approved on February 22, saying ""all relevant professionally prepared information held by council is considered when assessing a proposal"".
If the $25 million figure suggested by valuers were correct it would push the ratepayer contribution to the project to at least $43 million.
Respected long-term property developer and valuer Geoff Glanville told the Sunshine Coast Daily in March the only way to accurately value the site would be to work back from the Gross Realisations the development approval would achieve to determine what a prudent developer would be prepared to pay for the land.",www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au,2018-07-05 08:07:00,17,428009
"Sydney fog causes commuter chaos as ferries cancelled, planes diverted
Updated
Planes have been diverted and ferries cancelled after Sydney woke up this morning to a thick blanket of fog covering the city.
The fog covered the Sydney Harbour Bridge and almost the whole city skyline, with only the tallest buildings poking through.
All ferries have been cancelled this morning because of the fog, Sydney Airport was also advising customers to check with their airlines, after a number of services were delayed or diverted.
Some flights were diverted to Brisbane and Melbourne this morning, waiting for the fog to clear.
A Qantas spokesperson said the airline was doing ""everything we can"" to get our customers on their way and to their destinations ""as soon as possible"".
David Wright from Transport Management Centre said buses would replace ferry services between Manly and Circular Quay.
""What we're advising passengers to do is either delay their travel or seek an alternative mode of transport,"" he said.
""What usually happens in scenarios like this is once the sun comes up the fog will burn.
""Our captains and all our marine staff at the moment are monitoring and as soon as it is safe for those services to resume they will certainly resume.""
Some Sydneysiders were complaining on social media about a fog horn blowing incessantly from 5:00am, in turn becoming an unwanted alarm clock.
There were heavy delays expected on the city's roads despite the fog beginning to lift about 7:45am.
Once the fog is lifted, Thursday is expected to a beautiful Sydney winter's day with a top of 23 degrees Celsius.

Solo travel is gaining popularity and women especially are opting to feed their inner travel bigs, even if it means leaving their partners at home. lzf
THERE has never been a more exciting time to travel with more destinations, experiences and affordable options than ever before - and solo travellers, especially women, are signing up in big numbers.
No longer stigmatised as lonely hearts, solo travellers are choosing to travel independently for a number of reasons, often leaving partners or loved ones at home.
The safety of group tours, the opportunity to meet like-minded souls, the desire to connect with a sense of self, and a rising confidence to explore the world alone are all playing their part.
Brisbane-based company Albatross Tours specialises in European holidays and has seen a 20 per cent increase in the past three years in bookings made by solo travellers.
Marketing manager Michele Zavaglia said one in every five travellers at Albatross were unaccompanied.
""The younger baby boomers in their fifties are now starting to travel more. Many are divorced or never married, however they have reached a time in their lives where they can afford to travel. We also have lots of women travel with us and leave their partners at home, as their partners have no interest in travelling,"" she said.
Travellers know how much there is to see out there and aren't waiting for anyone else to set off on the trips of their lifetime. SeanPavonePhoto
Online travel agency Global Journeys based in Noosa Heads offers more than 4,000 tours and cruises worldwide.
It has experienced a sharp increase in the number of solo travellers in recent years, with most aged either in their twenties or over-65 and women accounting for a huge 80 per cent.
According to CEO Campbell Harris, travel accessibility and a broader range of experiences from luxury tours to camping trips has opened the doors for solo travellers.
""People who may never have wanted to travel alone but had not considered touring previously, in part due to the reputation of big busses and crowds following a bright paddle, are now exploring the options available to them,"" he said.
The most popular destinations for solo travellers with Albatross are Italy, Spain and France, while at Global Journeys they are noticing a trend towards adventure travel and immersive experiences.
""People want to have real in-depth experiences when they travel and to learn about the culture of the places they are visiting,"" Mr Harris said.
""They want to interact with the locals and discover the traditions and history of the region... With local guides, people on tour are given a different insight - they find themselves cooking in a local home and joining in on traditional dances and having those immersive moments that travellers tend to be chasing more of these days.""
Touring has become a popular option for solo travellers who set out to meet like-minded travellers. Maica
Other destinations such as South Africa, Mr Harris said, were more often chosen by families or small groups travelling together.
Touring is also becoming more affordable for solo travellers who are being targeted in deals that reduce fees for private rooms, or in some cases, waive the solo supplement altogether.
""Many of our adventure focused small group trips do not charge solo supplements and many of the river cruise operators are also offering single cabins, or 'no single-supplement offers' that are running throughout the season,"" Mr Harris said.
Albatross has recently released a brochure for solo travellers and is planning solo-only tours in the future.
""One of our Italian tours departing shortly will have 13 solo travellers, with no other travellers on board,"" Ms Zavaglia said.

"QUEENSLAND would receive a $518 million cash injection from the Federal Government in the most significant reform to GST since it was introduced almost 20 years ago.
Treasurer Scott Morrison will say under the eight-year, $7 billion plan, to be announced today, no state will be worse off in terms of how much cash it receives.
But the system requires up to $1 billion a year in general government revenue to be injected into the GST pool to make this happen, putting pressure on the Budget bottom line.
It follows a 12 month review into the GST system by the Productivity Commission (PC).
But the Government has thrown out the report's major recommendation into how to share the cash, which would have seen Queensland $11 billion worse off over four years.
It would have created a political nightmare for a Government staring down five by-elections and a Federal election within a year.
Instead, the new system will be benchmarked to the performance of NSW or Victoria, which ever is higher, in a bid to stabilise the system.
Federal treasurer Scott Morrison: Under the eight-year, $7 billion plan, to be announced today, no state will be worse off in terms of how much cash it receives. Picture: AAP Image/ Joel Carrett
Cash injections from general government tax revenue will be used to increase the size of the GST pool to make sure no state is worse off in dollar terms.
A floor price of 70c per dollar of GST collected will also be introduced in 2021-22 and increased to 75c per dollar in 2024-25, despite the PC warning it could ""bite"" the budget in the future.
The Treasurer and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, must now try to sell the new plan to state treasurers at a special Federal Financial Relations council meeting to be held in September. They will be able to opt out of the new system and remain on the current model if they chose.
The Palaszczuk Government was last night sceptical of the Turnbull Government's pledge that Queensland would not lose out.
""Queensland needs to see Malcolm Turnbull's modelling that proves these changes don't leave our state worse off,"" a Government spokesman said.
""Saying 'no-one loses' is easy. Proving it requires a very substantial pool of funds that Scott Morrison will need to clearly identify and explain later today.
""If any of that money is coming from existing National Partnership agreements supporting schools hospitals and roads in Queensland, then this is no solution at all.""
Mr Morrison said the Productivity Commission's recommendation would have unnecessarily hurt states as they transitioned to the new system.
""No state will be financially disadvantaged as a result of moving to this new benchmark,"" he said.
""This will be the first time real changes have been made to fix problems in how the GST is shared since the GST was introduced almost 20 years ago.""
The PC's original recommendation was to link distribution to the average fiscal capacity of all states, instead of NSW or Victoria, which it argued would encourage more tax reform among the states.
Queensland is expected to receive $14.8 billion in GST this financial year, being paid out at $1.10 for every dollar of GST contributed.
The new model projects the state will continue to be paid out at $1.11 to $1.15 for every dollar collected for at least the next eight years.
But the overall GST pool will be boosted by annual ""top up"" payments from the Federal Government from general tax revenue.
These will begin with a $600 million injection in 2021-22, of which Queensland will receive $87 million.
The annual payments will increase to $1.053 billion in 2026-27, with Queensland to receive $105 million that year.
It will have received $518 million in total top up payments by 2026-27.
WA and the NT will receive a combined $1.468 billion in top up payments by 2020-21, before other states, to bring them up to speed.
The Government says this will not impact the razor-thin projected surplus in 2019-20, but that the details of how will not be revealed until the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO).",www.thechronicle.com.au,2018-07-05 07:55:24,29,384751
"A BRISBANE mum withdrew more than $500,000 from her millionaire de facto's company bank account to ""put herself in a better position"" ahead of their relationship breakdown.
Zebaney Davoren has to pay back $520,186 after Supreme Court Justice Peter Davis ruled there seemed “little doubt” she took the money.
Zebaney Davoren has to pay back $520,186 today after Supreme Court Justice Peter Davis ruled there seemed ""little doubt"" she took the money from Ramy Raymond's property development company between March and June this year.
The court heard Ms Davoren took the money from the company belonging to Mr Raymond, 48, from Paddington in Brisbane's west, ""to live on"" and ""to put herself in a better position"" in the upcoming asset split as part of their break-up.
Apartment developer Mr Raymond discovered the money was missing last month. Ms Davoren's lawyer Allison Caputo wrote to Mr Raymond's lawyers on June 28 conceding that ""$500,000 was removed"".
""Our client felt compelled to ensure that she had some financial security in the event that your client took steps to limit her access to income and property,"" Ms Caputo wrote.
Justice Davis told the court Ms Caputo's partial admission that Ms Davoren had ""no right to the money"" had raised ""real questions"" about Ms Davoren's ""criminal responsibility for the misappropriation of the funds"".
Ms Davoren spent $61,250 on a Range Rover, and $354,902 of the money remained in her bank account, the court heard. Repayment of the money will put her account into overdraft.
The couple were in a relationship for at least 14 years, since 2001, but the exact date of their separation is in dispute, the court heard.
Ms Davoren was also bookkeeper for at least one of Mr Raymond's companies, and withdrew the money via electronic banking.
The court heard Ms Davoren was set to be paid $2,475,000 by Mr Raymond in a separation agreement, but this agreement was ""not enforceable"", and had been changed.
Justice Davis ruled she took the $520,186 from Mr Raymond's company as ""a system of self help"" and because it was ""convenient"", when she should have left it to the court or a mediator to decide how to split the couple's assets.

Cameron Bancroft has spent the last couple of months pondering his existence, and going by what he said on Saturday before flying to Darwin to resume his cricket career, the time off has given him some perspective and a new level of self-awareness.
In an era of athletes and sporting organisations hiding behind corporate speak and pre-prepared media statements, it was refreshing to hear someone acknowledge their mistake and speak openly and honestly about the process in overcoming it.
It was a lesson for not only other athletes, but anyone in any occupation.
But it has taken Bancroft a while to come to terms with the magnitude of what happened in Cape Town in March and the days that followed.
""It can be really challenging to deal with, really challenging to digest the different opinions that fly around,"" he said.
""It was a lot opinion, a lot of people saying things.
""I think for me it was about, in that situation it was it was about my mistake and it was about the poor decision that I made.
""What anyone else thought or said didn't change the fact I made a really bad decision.""
The road to forgiveness
Whatever the reason behind Bancroft taking sandpaper on to the field in a Test match to change the state of the ball, early indications are the 25-year-old has learned from it.
And the good news for him is the Australian sporting public is generally pretty forgiving.
Athletes who have performed far worse actions than tampering with a cricket ball have been welcomed back into the fold.
Bancroft has made a mistake, owned it, shown remorse and is adamant it won't happen again, which appears to be a sound model for anyone trying to regain the trust of supporters and repair their reputation.
He deserves some credit for the way he has handled himself.
A lot of the time pride, ego or taking the emotional risk to admit to yourself that you have made a mistake get in the way of moving past it.
Yoga, Spanish and charity help fill the void
Filling the void left by cricket has been Bancroft's other big challenge.
He has dedicated his time off to self-development, including yoga, Spanish lessons and helping some charity groups.
This may or may not have been prescribed by the WACA or Cricket Australia, but you get a genuine sense Bancroft is doing his best to make good from a bad situation.
""As hard as it is to connect learning Spanish and playing cricket for Australia again, they are all little stepping stones to me achieving that dream again,"" he said.
""There have been times I have felt really sad, felt really angry but I have worked really hard on myself.""
The opener, who is renowned for his elite work ethic and preparation to achieve results on the field, is now ticking all the right boxes to get back to doing what he loves.

"PLASTIC bags.
I am sick of them.
I am sick of hearing people whinge about them, I'm sick of reading news stories about them.
So, of course, I have chosen to dedicate 250 words to the topic.
It seems like a lot of people who are mad about the ban are the type of people who get mad whenever something in their life changes.
Until something else minor comes along for them to blow their lid about they'll get red faced every time they are forced to look at/touch/use a reusable bag.
They complain about 15 cent thicker plastic bags, they complain about 99 cent green bags.
I wish I was one of those amazing people who was already using reusable bags before our lives got turned upside down by this out-of-the-blue policy, but I'm not organised enough for that.
So, I have done something amazing which required me to use forethought for a whole five seconds.
I put reusable bags in my car.
This simple change in behaviour has released me from pain, trials and tribulations faced by everyday Australians who just want to use harmful single-use plastic because it's convenient.
No longer will I feel the urge to abuse, hit and swear at humble checkout workers who are just passing down policies from their overlords.
But, seriously.
It's not a big deal.
If I, the most unorganised person I know, can deal with it so can you.

MARTIAL ARTS: Sunshine Coast Muay Thai fighter Billy Coulter may be facing his toughest challenge in the ring, but he's also in the best form of his career, coach Joe Hilton says.
The 25-year-old is gearing up to unload a ferocious attack on Tyler Hardcastle on Saturday in a bid to earn the World Muay Thai Council's Australian professional welterweight title.
His battle will headline Coastal Warfare 15, which will be held at The Shed in Palmview.
Although confident, Coulter believed his match-up with Western Australia's Hardcastle would be a momentous test of his fighting ability.
""I personally think this will be my toughest fight to date, purely because he is southpaw and I'm orthodox and I've never come across a southpaw before so it'll be tricky,” he said.
""He'll be throwing a lot off his left and I've pretty much got to do the same thing with my right. Right hands, right kicks and just throwing everything straight down the middle.”
But coach Hilton had faith that his charge, who has embraced a rigorous training regime, would be able to overcome his opponent.
""His preparation is brilliant and he's probably the fittest and strongest he's been,” Hilton said.
""Billy is very strong and he kicks hard, he punches hard and all of his eight weapons are all very strong.
""He is just a well-balanced fighter and he is one of these guys that the more that you show him and the harder you push him the harder he goes so I just think he will be too hard (to beat).”
Coulter has won the state amateur title and also fought and defended the state professional title on his journey to this weekend's national opportunity.
""I started Muay Thai probably five years ago and I've been flat out for five years training eight times a week so to get the win and get the belt (on Saturday) will mean a lot,” he said.
And while a national title is on the line, far greater opportunities loom if the Sunshine Coast Thai Boxing Centre fighter comes out victorious.
""This will be a big one for him and if we win this one then he can go on to challenge for the South Pacific title and that'll be against one of the fighters from New Zealand,” Hilton said.
""I've trained a few world champions and I believe that Billy has got the goods, and definitely the mentality, to go all the way.”
Coulter had qualified for the Muay Thai World Championships later this year, but will skip it in order to focus on his professional career. Coastal Warfare will also feature two other professional fights and seven amateur battles.",www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au,2018-07-05 07:10:00,17,427777

SOARING SUCCESS: Kris Minns and Dustyn Brown won a trip to the Ryder Cup in Paris later in the year after winning the Allianz Insurance Golf Day national final. Contributed
DESPITE admitting that he's not the most ""handy” golfer on course, Dustyn Brown's skills have still landed him a dream trip to enjoy one of the world's premier tournaments.
Regional Insurance Brokers account manager Brown and his colleague Kris Minns have won an all-expenses-paid holiday to Paris, France, to watch the sport's elite compete in The Ryder Cup.
The duo earned the opportunity after winning the national final of the Allianz Golf Tournament last month at The Australian Golf Club in Sydney.
Although coming up against state winners from across the country, Brown and Minns managed to hit a score of 46 points to win by three shots.
Brown was ecstatic to win the Allianz competition considering he only gets to hit the Mt Coolum course once a month.
He said his colleague Minns only managed to get out on the Beerwah course on a monthly basis as well.
""I wouldn't say we're handy at golf,” he said.
""I am off a 17 handicap and Kris is off 22 so it was a luck of the draw type competition and that's what's good about it.”
While Brown and Minns will get the opportunity to watch some of the world's best golfers in action at The Ryder Cup, they'll also have the chance to put their own skills to the test.
""We get to go over and watch the best golfers in the world for three or four days play against each other and then we get to go and have three days of playing golf ourselves on some really nice courses,” he said.
""It's nothing that either of us would (normally) do and its sort of a bucket list item that you kind of think you might be able to do one time when you're retired.
""But thanks to Allianz Insurance it's a once in a lifetime opportunity (we get to live now).”",www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au,2018-07-05 07:06:00,13,428007
"Fact check: Are your chances of getting the flu after a vaccination only decreased by 1 to 2 per cent?
Updated
The claim
Australia is well into the midst of winter, and with the cold weather comes flu.
Last year saw the highest levels of flu activity in Australia since the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
This year Australians wanting to be vaccinated against the flu mobilised in unprecedented numbers, forcing the Federal Government to order an additional 800,000 vaccines.
But the effectiveness of the vaccine was called into question by professor of Public Health at Bond University, Chris Del Mar, in an interview with Neil Mitchell on 3AW.
""It actually reduces the chance of getting flu by about 1 to 2 per cent — that's laboratory confirmed influenza. It makes a tiny difference.""
So, are your chances of getting the flu after a vaccination only decreased by 1 to 2 per cent? RMIT ABC Fact Check finds out.
The verdict
Professor Del Mar's claim is misleading.
The source of Professor Del Mar's claim is a systematic review of studies measuring the efficacy of flu vaccine in preventing the flu in healthy adults.
That review found the flu vaccine decreased the rate of flu infection from 2.3 per cent to 0.9 per cent in healthy adults.
Experts contacted by Fact Check said while this showed an absolute drop in the infection of 1.4 percentage points, using these numbers to talk about effectiveness was misleading.
Professor Del Mar should instead have talked about the relative drop in infection, which is the effectiveness rate of the vaccine.
The very study quoted by Professor Del Mar found that the flu vaccine had an estimated effectiveness rate of 59 per cent — not 1 to 2 per cent.
That means for an individual who has been vaccinated, the risk of getting the flu is more than halved.
This is supported by other studies cited by the Australian Department of Health's Immunisation Handbook, which found similar effectiveness rates.
What is the flu?
Influenza, or 'the flu', is a respiratory disease that causes symptoms including fever, cough, muscle aches, headache, nasal congestion, sore throat and fatigue.
It is estimated to cause an average of 13,500 hospitalisations and 3000 deaths in Australia each year.
Three types of influenza affect humans — type A, B and C. Influenza A and B are responsible for most infections in humans.
The flu is further classified into 'strains' of which there are many and which are constantly mutating and changing.
According to the Australian Immunisation Handbook, published by the Department of Health, the period of peak influenza circulation is typically between June and September for most parts of Australia, though flu could occur year-round in tropical regions.
How does the vaccine work?
New flu vaccines are developed in preparation for each flu season in both the northern and southern hemispheres.
Flu vaccines can either be inactivated — where the virus is essentially ""dead"" — or live attenuated, where the virus is alive, but weakened.
All flu vaccines currently available in Australia are inactivated.
Flu vaccines typically contain three to four strains of the flu — two type A strains and one or two type B strains.
As different strains of influenza circulate each flu season, a certain amount of guesswork goes into deciding which strains will be included in the vaccine.
In February and September each year, the World Health Organisation gathers experts and influenza centres from around the world in order to make recommendations on the composition of the next flu vaccine.
Once the World Health Organisation has made its recommendation, the Australian Influenza Vaccine Committee meets with the Therapeutic Goods Administration to confirm which strains will be included in the Australian vaccine.
In addition to the standard flu vaccine, this year there are enhanced flu vaccines available to elderly Australians.
These vaccines include three strains of the virus rather than the usual four, and are designed to target the strains most commonly affecting older people.
The context of the claim
Professor Del Mar's interview on 3AW came days after a speech he made at the GPs Down Under Conference on the Gold Coast, where he questioned whether the flu vaccine was being oversold.
Multiple news outlets reported that in his speech Professor Del Mar pointed to a review ""that found seasonal flu vaccines only reduced the rate of laboratory confirmed influenza cases by between 1 to 2 per cent"".
In an article in The Conversation, Professor Del Mar and his co-author, Professor Peter Collignon, again repeated the claim that flu infections are only reduced by one per cent.
""[A review] found the vaccine reduced the chance of getting laboratory-confirmed influenza from 23 cases out of 1,000 to 9 cases out of 1,000.
""While this seems to be a reduction of more than 50 per cent, that seems less optimistic expressed in absolute terms.
""The infection rate in adults drops from 2 per cent per year to 1 per cent. You could say that's halved, but it effectively only drops by 1 per cent.""
The source of the claim
The review quoted by Professor Del Mar in the article in The Conversation is one of a series of three reviews into the effectiveness of the flu vaccine.
Those reviews, which look at flu in healthy adults, healthy children and the elderly come from Cochrane, an independent organisation that produces systematic reviews of medical research in order to make that research more accessible.
The Cochrane reviews referenced by Professor Del Mar compared a number of studies estimating the effectiveness of flu vaccine in order to come up with a single, overarching estimate of effectiveness.
""The first Cochrane review looked at the effects of the influenza vaccine in healthy adults from 25 studies conducted over single influenza seasons in North America, South America, and Europe between 1969 and 2009,"" the article in The Conversation states.
What the report says
That Cochrane review found that without vaccination 23 healthy adults per 1000 would get the flu while for those who had been vaccinated nine per 1000 would get the flu.
In other words: ""Inactivated influenza vaccines probably reduce influenza in healthy adults from 2.3 per cent without vaccination to 0.9 per cent.""
In their conclusions, the Cochrane reviewers state:
""Healthy adults who receive inactivated parenteral influenza vaccine rather than no vaccine probably have a one per cent lower risk of experiencing influenza over a single influenza season (2.3 per cent versus one per cent, moderate-certainty evidence).""
The review also states:
""Inactivated parenteral vaccines probably have 59% efficacy in preventing confirmed influenza.""
What that means for the infection rate
Experts told Fact Check the Cochrane review showed the risk of getting the flu was halved by the vaccine.
Dr David Price, a biostatistician at the University of Melbourne, told Fact Check: ""What these numbers mean, is that for every 1000 people, 23 would get flu without a vaccine programme. However, with a vaccine programme, the number of people who would get flu reduces to 9 in 1000.""
The difference in these values, Dr Price explained, showed that for every 1000 individuals vaccinated, 14 flu cases were prevented.
""It appears as though Professor Del Mar may have misinterpreted this figure as the vaccine effectiveness, which it is not. The vaccine effectiveness is actually around 59 per cent,"" Dr Price said.
""A fairer statement in referring to the difference between 0.9 per cent and 2.3 per cent would be to refer to a reduction of 1.4 percentage-points. When thinking about this difference as a relative difference... we can see that the total number of cases as a result of the vaccine has more than halved, and thus sounds far more effective than stating that the vaccine only reduces influenza by one to two per cent.""
Associate Professor Mark Chatfield, a biostatistician from the University of Queensland, told Fact Check:
""With two proportions, you can talk about absolute differences or relative differences or both. He talks about absolute differences. I think vaccine efficacy is more often expressed as a relative difference.""
Associate Professor Chatfield said both numbers should always be given in order to be clear when talking about two proportions; in this case Professor Del Mar should have specified the drop was from 2.3 per cent to 0.9 per cent.
""The public has probably been misled when [Professor Del Mar] gave the smaller absolute difference, rather than the larger relative difference, without saying whether he was meaning absolute or relative, which conveniently added to his argument.""
The Cochrane Review showed the flu vaccine halved the risk of getting the flu, Associate Professor Chatfield said.
Dr Rob Menzies, a senior lecturer from the School of Public Health and Community Medicine at UNSW, also agreed that the review showed the risk of getting the flu was more than halved.
""Using the figures in the systematic review, the vaccine reduced disease from 2.3 per cent to 0.9 per cent, which is a roughly 60 per cent reduction. This is very similar to other published estimates of effectiveness of flu vaccine of 59 per cent against laboratory-confirmed influenza in healthy younger adults.""
Is the Cochrane Review reliable?
The Cochrane Review found 2.3 per cent of people had laboratory confirmed influenza — flu confirmed by a diagnostic test.
Professor Allen Cheng, the director of the Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology Unit at Alfred Health, explained that using this figure as a baseline ignored unconfirmed flu infections.
""Not all patients get a diagnostic test after getting influenza infection, and the test isn't completely sensitive, for example if the swab isn't taken well [it may not give accurate results],"" Professor Cheng said.
""How many people with flu like symptoms went to to the GP or hospital and got a flu test? Clearly not every person with the flu.""
Professor Robert Booy, head of the Clinical Research team at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, told Fact Check that with a lack of diagnostic testing, experts could only estimate that five to 10 per cent of the Australian population would get the flu in any given year.
He also had concerns about bias in the Cochrane reviews.
""They're all done by the same people — the three reviews all came from the same stable so they always have the same biases,"" Professor Booy said.
""There's a concern that from the outset [the Cochrane reviewers] have had a subjective, nihilistic, negative view about the vaccine.""
This concern was shared by Professor Raina MacIntyre, who is the head of the Biosecurity Research Program at the Kirby Institute who told Fact Check:
""Despite the assertion that Cochrane reviews are 'independent' they are subject to the same personal biases as any other research study. Cochrane reviews can show opposite results based on who does them. They have been re-analysed (using the same data) by one group to get completely different results from another group.""
So, how effective is the flu vaccine?
Dr Menzies told Fact Check:
""The best authoritative source on vaccine effectiveness is the Australian Immunisation Handbook.""
The Australian Immunisation Handbook is developed by Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) and approved by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).
According to the handbook:
""The efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines of similar composition depends primarily on the age and immunocompetence of the vaccine recipient, and the degree of similarity between the virus strains in the vaccine and those circulating in the community.""
The handbook refers to a number of systematic reviews and studies into the efficiency of flu vaccine.
One such study, Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in the United States during the 2015-2016 Season, found quadrivalent vaccines (vaccines with four strains of flu) to be 54 per cent effective.
A systematic review cited by the handbook found trivalent vaccines (three strains) to be 59 per cent effective, though this varied dependent on the season.
Professor MacIntyre added that the potential benefits of flu vaccine extend beyond preventing flu itself.
""There is also evidence that flu vaccine prevents heart attacks, because flu affects the clotting of the blood and the lining of the arteries through various mechanisms.
[The flu vaccine] can have a significant impact on preventing illness, hospitalisation and death, and experts around the world agree on this.""

"UK counter-terrorism police confirm couple poisoned by nerve agent Novichok
Updated
British counter-terrorism police have confirmed that the couple who fell critically ill near the English town where a former spy and his daughter were poisoned in March were also exposed to the Russian nerve agent Novichok.
Key points: No intelligence to suggest the couple were deliberately targeted
Police investigating whether case is linked to poisoning of former Russian spy
The man and woman remain in critical conditions in hospital
Police said there was no evidence they had visited the same sites that were decontaminated after the Skripal case.
""I have received test results from Porton Down [military research centre] which show that the two people have been exposed to the nerve agent Novichok,"" Neil Basu, Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer, told reporters.
UK counter-terrorism police are now leading the investigation and said the possibility that the case is linked with the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia was a line of enquiry.
But Mr Basu said there was no intelligence to indicate that the man and woman had been deliberately targeted.
He also told reporters police did not yet know how the Novichok nerve agent was transmitted.
The man, 45, and woman, 44 — both British nationals — remain in a critical condition in hospital after being found unconscious at a residential building in Amesbury on Saturday evening (local time).
Police have not named the couple, but friends have named them as Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess.
Sam Hobson said he was with them on Saturday, when Ms Sturgess fell ill first.
He told Sky News she was ""having a fit, foam coming out of her mouth"".
Mr Rowley collapsed later the same day.
""He was sweating loads, dribbling … he was rocking backwards and forwards,"" Mr Hobson said.
""There was no response from him. He didn't even know I was there.""
British Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said the Government's emergency response committee had met to discuss the incident.
The pair, who are being treated at Salisbury District Hospital, were initially believed to have taken heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch but tests showed they had been poisoned with Novichok, a nerve agent developed by the Soviet military in the Cold War.
""We are not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to,"" Mr Basu said.
""The possibility that these two investigations might be linked is clearly a line of enquiry for us.""
Amesbury is just 11 kilometres north of Salisbury, where the Skripals were found slumped unconscious on a bench on March 4.
Police have cordoned off at least five different areas, including a park and a property in Salisbury, and a pharmacy and a Baptist church community centre in Amesbury, although health chiefs said the risk to the public was low.
Britain accused Russia of poisoning Skripal with the Novichok nerve agent, the first known offensive use of such a chemical weapon on European soil since World War II.
The attack prompted the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the Cold War as allies sided with Prime Minister Theresa May's view that Moscow was either responsible or had lost control of the nerve agent.
Russia denied any involvement and suggested Britain had carried out the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.

NETBALL: Sunshine Coast goal attack Stephanie Wood says the Lightning are finally beginning to ""walk the walk” as the season heads into a crucial stage.
The Coast outfit toppled Firebirds in a nail-biter last week and Wood said it had been an important result as they prepare to take on competition leaders West Coast Fever on Saturday.
""For us every game now is a must win and we've put ourselves in that position and the games we've lost have only been by three (goals) but we've still lost them,” she said.
""We didn't want to get to the end of the season and think 'what if' and we've definitely had hard conversations with each other.
""Sometimes we talk the talk in training but we weren't walking the walk in games and I think that game was probably the first game that we've done it for 60 minutes.”
The Lightning will travel to Perth to take on Fever in a round 10 fixture on Saturday and, despite the journey, Wood was confident of a positive result.
""Looking back at the game when played them here (at USC Stadium) we only lost by one (goal) and we definitely had opportunities to win that game.
""Fever are an absolute force but I think they've also shown that they are beatable.”
In honour of NAIDOC Week celebrations, and the inaugural Super Netball Indigenous round, Lightning will don custom-made uniform.
It is designed by Gubbi Gubbi artist Kerry Neill and features the bunya pine, a symbol commonly found in Gubbi Gubbi paintings, carvings and dances.
""All the designs featured in the dress were given to me by my mother and they pay homage to her and all of the women in our family line,” Neill said.

"Wimbledon: Roger Federer extends his SW19 streak to 26 straight sets in dominant victory over Lukas Lacko
Updated
As Roger Federer was winning 35 consecutive service points at Wimbledon on Wednesday — yes, 35 in a row — a Centre Court spectator cheered him on while wearing a red shirt with white lettering that said, ""PeRFect.""
The Swiss great comes pretty close to living up to that at times.
Federer moved into the third round at the All England Club as he chases his record-extending ninth championship there, using close-to-impeccable serving to beat 73rd-ranked Lukas Lacko of Slovakia 6-4, 6-4, 6-1.
The 36-year-old Federer compiled 48 winners and just 11 unforced errors. He won 40 of 43 first-serve points, never faced a break chance, and delivered 16 aces.
""Sometimes your serve matches up better against certain players,"" he said. ""There's no doubt about that.""
Talk about an understatement.
At 4-3, 40-30, Federer hit a 190kph ace to hold and start his roll that included the last five points he served in the first set, all 20 in the second, and then the first 10 of the third.
By then, it was so dominant that one television announcer was moved to jokingly exclaim, ""Come on, double-fault!"".
Federer did not oblige, but moments later, he did lose a point he served at 4-1, 30-love, when Lacko smacked a down-the-line backhand passing winner.
""I think (what's) important when you want to serve well is your point-for-point mentality, saying, maybe, 'The first point is as important as a break point,' so the concentration is the same,"" Federer explained.
""Trying to remember all the things you've done throughout the entire match — what has worked, what hasn't worked.""
Very little did not work on this day, and he's allowed his two opponents to collect a total of 17 games through six sets.
Very little hasn't worked for him over the years at Wimbledon, even now that he's in his mid-30s.
Wednesday's result increased Federer's streak to 26 straight sets at Wimbledon, equalling his second-best run, which came in 2003-04. His best was a 34-streak sequence from 2005-06.
A year ago, Federer became the first man since Bjorn Borg in 1976 to win the title at the grass-court Grand Slam tournament without ceding a single set.
So what, Federer was asked, makes him so successful on grass?
""I don't know. I don't know,"" he began, before offering quite a list for someone who doesn't know.
""Maybe it's that it helps my slice. That maybe the footwork on grass comes easier to me than for other guys. I'm not sure. Then because I have a decent speed on the serve, and I can serve kick and slice.
""Maybe also the grass helps me just a little bit to get a few more free points than what it would on some other surfaces.""

THE TV awards shows around the world including the Emmys and BAFTAs are often a source of amusement, fake celebrities and some surprising winners but Australia has raised it to a new level.
The Gold Logie, named after John Logie Baird, the inventor of the TV, is the ultimate Australian prize and as the voting is done by the public, the TV networks spend fortunes on promoting their particular nominee.
The winner was Grant Denyer, a pleasant young man who smiles a lot.
He has been nominated for various categories 22 times before without a single win and has a very practised smile and a 'they're wonderful' speech but this year he won.
The part that makes his story different is that although this is a popularity award his quiz show was not so popular and the show was cancelled mid-season.
A comedian, on an opposing channel, known for sarcasm decided to run a subversive campaign to get the fired presenter the big award and it worked.
He also won the most popular presenter award - it's a bit like painters who only sell paintings after they die.
The Australian media image is not helped by Gogglebox, a TV show with people sitting on couches watching TV being the most popular entertainment show.
No wonder streaming services are becoming so popular when TV awards that are ridiculous reflect the poor quality of material being shown.

"YOUR columnist, Paul Murray (Daily, June 30), rhetorically asked readers if they felt they get value from local government.
It is worth noting that Queensland's 77 councils manage approximately $110 billion worth of infrastructure and spend up to $3 billion a year on capital works on behalf of their communities.
Consider also that, across the nation, councils collect through their rates and charges, just three per cent of all public taxation revenue generated in Australia - with the other 97 per cent going to federal (82%) and state (15%) governments.
Yet councils are obliged to manage 25 per cent of all public infrastructure.
I think it is pretty clear where communities are getting better value for money - through their local government.
The uninformed posturing by Mr Murray does nothing to advance public debate in this country.
Focussing on job titles is puerile behaviour - and let's face it, the media that he represents and the private sector have more than their fair share of absurd job titles.
Perhaps Mr Murray needs to get out more and experience the realities of serving a community, planning for its future, providing a vast array of services, managing and preserving local environmental assets and pursuing opportunities that will deliver more opportunities for residents.
That is where government and community connects and where a difference is actually made - not in the rarified atmosphere of the parliaments in Canberra, Sydney or indeed any state capital.

"A LISMORE woman accused of perjury has been given permission to move to Queensland.
Prosecutors allege Tiffany Ann Martin, 27, lied under oath during a Local Court hearing on August 25 last year over an alleged assault by Shaun Hucker.
An indictment lodged by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions states that Ms Martin committed perjury on the stand, ""namely that she could not remember Shaun Hucker assaulting her.""
She faces two indictable perjury related charges which, if proven, could attract a jail sentence.
Ms Martin is also charged with the supply of an indictable quantity of MDMA, or ecstasy, between September 27 and 28 last year at Lismore Heights.
Ms Martin appeared before Lismore Local Court on Tuesday where DPP solicitor Alanna Coxon withdrew a charge of perverting the course of justice.
""The Director is instead preferring sequence 3 and 4,"" Ms Coxon said, referring to two fresh perjury charges: one count of perjury to procure acquittal in serious offence, and one count of making a false statement under oath amounting to perjury.
Ms Coxon also said the DPP had rejected a plea offer from the defence on June 12.
Ms Martin was initially charged on February 14.
The court heard that the accused, formerly of Lismore Heights and then South Lismore, is moving to Sunshine Acres, a suburb of Hervey Bay.
She was ordered her to report to Scarness Police Station on Mondays only.
Magistrate Annette Sinclair adjourned the matter to August 7 to return to Lismore Local Court.
Ms Martin is required to enter a plea on the next occasion.",www.northernstar.com.au,2018-07-05 07:00:00,13,150908

A MAN police allege has been on the run since early 2016 has been released from custody.
Anthony Clifford Gibbons, 47, faced Tweed Heads Local Court via video link this afternoon.
Police have alleged Mr Clifford, who lives in Helensvale on the Gold Coast, is accused of assaulting a man at a remote Loadstone property, north of Kyogle, on January 12, 2016.
Defence solicitor Amanda Fawaz lodged not guilty pleas on Mr Gibbons' behalf to his three charges, which include assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company, affray and stalking or intimidation.
After he surrendered to police in Tweed Heads, officers executed outstanding arrest warrants for those charges.
He was initially refused bail and appeared via video link from Tweed Heads Police Station.
Ms Fawaz lodged an application for Mr Gibbons to be released on conditional bail, which Magistrate Geoff Dunlevy granted.
According to court documents, the victim - the 63-year-old landlord of Mr Gibbon's nephew - thought he was ""going to die” during an altercation on his property.
The landlord was allegedly assaulted and threatened by Mr Gibbons and his nephew, 29-year-old Samuel Webb, after they fought about the idea of lighting a small fire on the property.
The incident allegedly involved Mr Gibbons putting the victim in a headlock and threatening him.
The victim retaliated, punching the accused several times, according to court documents.
In April, Webb, who threatened to behead the victim, was sentenced to 18 months' prison with a nine month non-parole period for one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and one count of stalking or intimidation.
Mr Dunlevy ordered the police brief of evidence to be filed by August 1 and adjourned the matter to August 27.",www.northernstar.com.au,2018-07-05 07:00:00,15,150830

THE new capital of Cowboys country - the Townsville stadium - can be seen like never before with the release of new images.
The final design is nearly complete for the $250 million stadium, under construction in South Townsville, and details about corporate boxes, patron terraces and food and beverage areas have been shown in striking artist's impressions.
Early works for the project were completed on April 30 this year and the main stadium build works started on May 1.
Civil earthworks, driven piling and a significant amount of substructure and in-ground hydraulics work has been completed, a spokesman for the Department of State Development, Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Planning says.

Significant off-site manufacture of steel and concrete elements is also under way with more than 500 precast seating platforms now stockpiled at the subcontractor's compound and on site ready for installation. Work is under way on the western, southern and eastern stands.
The western stand will accommodate the player, corporate and media facilities.

So far on the western stand work on concrete footings including lift and escalator pits have been completed. Vertical precast panels for stairs and lifts have also been finished.
Workers are erecting structural steel to the lower bowl and concourse level.
Meanwhile on the southern stand, work on the substructure and detailed excavation has been finished.
A schematic design was completed in August last year and since then the next stage, a developed design, has been completed.

"By Nobuhiro Kubo
Japan will send a large helicopter carrier to the South China Sea and Indian Ocean for a second straight year as it looks to bolster its presence in the strategic maritime region with annual tours, two Japanese officials said.
""This is part Japan's efforts to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" said one of the officials, who has direct knowledge of the plan for a two-month tour beginning in September.
The 248 meter-long Kaga, which can operate several helicopters simultaneously, will make stops in Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia and at ports in India and Sri Lanka, said the sources who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
The Kaga, which will be accompanied by an escort ship, may also conduct ad hoc joint drills with warships from other counties in the region, they said.
Japan last year sent its sister ship, the Izumo, on a similar tour of the contested South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.
A spokesman for Japan's Maritime Self Defense Force said he was unable to comment on future operations.
Japan's growing visibility in those waters reflects concern it shares with the United States over China's military presence in a region through which trade routes pass that are vital to the Japanese and U.S. economies.
China, which says its intentions are peaceful, claims most of the South China and has built bases on reefs and shoals it has reclaimed. China has also increased naval operations in the Indian Ocean.
The United States holds regular air and naval patrols in the South China Sea, saying it has to ensure freedom of navigation.
In May, it changed the name of its military Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii to Indo-Pacific Command to signal a broader regional strategy that has been promoted by Japan and Australia, stretching from the Western Pacific to the Indian Ocean.
Japan has not taken part in the U.S. freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea because doing so could provoke China which could increase its military presence in the East China Sea where the rivals are locked in a dispute over ownership of uninhabited islets known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.
Amid growing tension over trade and Chinese suspicion of U.S. intentions toward self-governing Taiwan, Chinese President Xi Jinping in June told U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that China was committed to peace but would not yield ""even one inch"" of territory handed down by its ancestors.
Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei also claim parts of the South China Sea, which has rich fishing grounds, as well as oil and gas deposits. Taiwan also claims the sea but Japan has no claim to any part of it.
In the Indian Ocean, tension between China and India has flared over China's growing presence in the Maldives, which despite long-standing political and security ties with India has signed up to China's Belt and Road initiative to build trade and transport links across Asia and beyond.
In order for Japan to take a wider regional role, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has stretched the limits of a post-war pacifist constitution by sending warships, planes and troops on overseas missions.
The Kaga, which is as big as any aircraft carrier operated by the Japanese Imperial Navy in World War Two, is designated as a destroyer to keep it within the bounds of those constitutional restraints.
Based in Kure in western Japan, the Kaga was commissioned in March last year and its primary mission is anti-submarine warfare. Its tour of the South China Sea and Indian Ocean follows a two-month trip to the region from May by the Osumi, an amphibious transport ship.

FOOTBALL fans and players have derided Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's controversial ""captain's call"" to name a grandstand at Suncorp Stadium after politician Terry Mackenroth.
But Ms Palaszczuk maintains fans need to appreciate the work the former deputy premier did in building Suncorp Stadium before they question the decision, which did not go to Cabinet.
A poll of more than 2000 couriermail.com.au readers revealed 76 per cent believed a sporting legend should have a stand named after them before a politician, while 50 per cent singled out Maroons legend Wally Lewis as the most suitable candidate.

Ms Palaszczuk attempted to deflect discussion on the issue by announcing a bronze statue of Allan Langer would be built outside the stadium during a press conference at manufacturing site yesterday.
It comes after the Queensland Rugby League board wrote to the Government to say the former Broncos halfback would be their preference to be immortalised.
Terry Mackenroth was honoured at Suncorp Stadium with a minute’s silence after his death in April.
She denied claims from the Opposition that the decision was a ""captain's call"", claiming it was made in consultation with Sports Minister Mick de Brenni and signed off by the former Stadiums Queensland board - which the Government sensationally replaced last week.
""Honestly, I don't know what all of the fuss is about; honestly, we wouldn't have Suncorp Stadium if it wasn't for Terry,"" she said.
""Let me make it very clear - my understanding is it is one panel and it will say the Terry Mackenroth stand. It is not a monument, but everyone who attends Suncorp Stadium, in fact Suncorp Stadium would not have been built if it wasn't for Terry. I think it is a fitting tribute, and as I said, I think this is a bit of a storm in a teacup - it is seriously one panel.""
Reader poll Should a stand at Suncorp Stadium be named for politician Terry Mackenroth before a sporting legend? Yes
No Vote View Results
Rugby league players were split on the decision, with Queensland hooker Andrew McCullough, whose family shared a connection with Terry Mackenroth, saying he was pleased to see him honoured at the stadium.
""It's very sad to have lost him but we should celebrate what he did for a lot of people in Queensland - not just in rugby league. If Suncorp want to honour him, that would be great,"" he said.
Queensland halfback Ben Hunt said he believed the naming of stands should be reserved for greats who have played there.
""If you're going to name a rugby league stadium or a stand after someone, it needs to be after one of the greats who has played there. There have definitely been a lot who have played for the Broncos and Queensland there. I don't see why it shouldn't be one of them,"" he said.
Queensland Rugby League boss Bruce Hatcher said Mr Mackenroth had masterminded the construction of the modern stadium and deserved the honour.
""Players play the game, that's fantastic, but there's a hell of a lot that goes on behind the scenes,"" Mr Hatcher said.
""There were a lot of proponents who said that stadium shouldn't be there, it should be demolished and moved.
""For what was created there it's outstanding and why wouldn't you recognise the individual who drove its development?""
Terry Mackenroth runs his eye over progress at the Suncorp Stadium redevelopment site back in December 2002.
Deputy Opposition Leader Tim Mander hit out at Ms Palaszczuk's decision to use the opportunity to announce that a statue for Langer had been decided upon.
""I think mentioning Alfie Langer today was incredibly disrespectful of Alf and a classic Labor Party tactic, which is we need a diversion, we need another shiny ball to take the attention away from that,"" he told 4BC radio.",www.news-mail.com.au,2018-07-05 06:46:37,29,86503
"Tokyo prosecutors on Wednesday arrested a high-ranking Japan education ministry official on a bribery charge, suspecting he granted a research subsidy to a medical school in exchange for admitting his child as a student.
Futoshi Sano, 58, the director general and former deputy vice minister, allegedly heeded a request in May 2017 by Tokyo Medical University, which asked to be named as a candidate for a ministry project in return for padding his child's entrance examination results.
The project dubbed ""Private university research branding project"" financially supports private universities in their featured research, such as by helping to build new facilities and purchase necessary equipment.
Tokyo Medical University sought to promote research on early detection of cancers and lifestyle-related diseases.
Out of 65 candidates, its research plan was selected in November 2017 for the funding, along with those of 26 other universities, and it received 35 million yen.
Although no money was involved, prosecutors determined that the deal in which Sano's child got into the university after receiving extra marks in its entrance exam constitutes bribery, investigative sources said.
Sano's child passed the exam in February, according to the special squad of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office.
""I deeply regret that one of our staff was arrested. We will cooperate fully with the investigation,"" education minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said, adding he will take the appropriate steps to see that Sano is held accountable.
Tokyo Medical University issued a statement saying it was being questioned by the prosecutors and that it is fully cooperating with the investigation.
Sano held prominent positions in the ministry after entering the former Science and Technology Agency in 1985. Deputy vice minister, the position he held when the university asked for the funding, has extensive authority over such matters as budgets and personnel affairs.
Since July 2017, Sano has been the director general of the Science and Technology Policy Bureau at the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.
According to one ministry source, Sano was seen as ""the elite of the elite."" Another source said, ""He was making steady headway on the career ladder.""
""He has the reputation of being clean, cool and collected. It's hard to imagine that he was involved in something like this,"" said a ministry official.
But another ministry staff said, ""He was always keen to make his mark. His ambitious personality was quite obvious.""
The prosecutors also arrested Koji Taniguchi, a 47-year-old company executive in Tokyo, for allegedly bringing Sano and the university together.
Taniguchi was an executive until February at a consulting firm mainly working with medical institutions.
Taniguchi was acquainted with both Sano and a Tokyo Medical University official believed to be involved in the case, according to investigative sources.
The prosecutors declined to comment on whether Sano and the school official have admitted to the charge.
The ministry has been hit by a string of scandals in recent years, some involving the long-standing practice, known as ""amakudari,"" of securing post-retirement jobs for civil servants.
The case also comes as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is under pressure over cronyism allegations, with one involving the altering of state land documents by the Finance Ministry.
The revelation has also shocked university students. One senior student said, ""It is unfair that someone can enter the university by using the influence of a parent.""
Another senior student expressed concern over possible repercussions, such as the government withdrawing from other subsidized projects.

"From their vineyards in southern France, the Shoji family have produced a hit white wine for the past year but are now threatened by an immigration law that would compel them to leave France citing their limited earnings
By Rémy Zaka with Fiachra Gibbons
French wine lovers have risen up in revolt after a Japanese couple who make ""outstanding"" wine in southern France were threatened with deportation.
More than 42,000 have already signed a petition protesting the ""crazy, moronic and shameful decision"", with wine and restaurant critics now joining the outcry.
Rie and Hirofumi Shoji's ""exceptional"" red wine, Pedres Blanques (White Rocks), made from grenache grapes near Banyuls-sur-Mer in the French Catalan region of Roussillon, became an instant hit after their first harvest last year.
It has already made the cellars of the world's best restaurant, Can Roca, just across the Spanish border in Girona, and top Paris restaurants have also been vying to stock up on the natural wine.
Their first year of production completely sold out, with 10,000 bottles quickly snapped up and the price surging from 12 euros ($14) to 26 euros.
But immigration officials said the couple could not stay in France because they were not earning enough and their business was ""not viable"".
The Shojis sunk 100,000 euros of their savings and took out a 50,000 euro loan to buy their vineyards on difficult terrain where the Pyrenees mountains plunge into the Mediterranean. They harvest the grapes by hand, growing them organically and without adding anything to the wine.
Hirofumi Shoji, 38, fell in love with French wine when he began working for the French three-star Michelin chef Alain Ducasse in Japan.
The Shojis met in France after arriving separately in 2011 dreaming of making their own wine. Both studied and worked with some of the country's leading winemakers in the Burgundy and Bordeaux regions to perfect their skills before marrying and buying the land together in 2016.
But when they tried to change their status on their papers from ""employees"" to ""farmers"" officials told them they would have to leave the country because they earned less than 2,000 euros a month.
Their lawyer Jean Codognes told AFP that at first he thought it was ""an administrative mistake but then three days ago the prefecture confirmed its order.""
""Their wine has been a huge success and 75 percent of the production for this year has already been reserved,"" he added. He said the couple had not had a centime of state aid to set up their business because they did not qualify as foreigners.
Renowned local winemaker Alain Castex also came to their defence, praising Pedres Blanques as ""an extraordinary wine"".
""They are really passionate people with very high ethical standards and they have been a magnificent success,"" he told French public television.
Jean L'Heritier, the organiser of a wine fair in Perpignan, the capital the Roussillon region, said it would be a ""huge loss for everyone if the Shojis had to leave. The quality of their grapes, and the typically Japanese perfectionism of their winemaking"" had impressed their peers, he told the local newspapers, L'Independant.
Callers to local radio stations raged at the officials as ""moronic"", and Twitter users also described the decision as ""criminal"". Green MEP Yannick Jadot called the decision ""absurd"" and urged his supporters to sign the petition to save the Shojis.
Banyuls is best known for its rich red dessert wines, often called the wine world's best-kept secret.
Codognes, who has appealed the decision, said the couple were doing well compared to many other winemakers locally. ""The average revenue in the area (from winemaking) even with subsidies is less than 1,000 euros a month,"" he added.
Several Japanese winemakers have made a name for themselves in France in recent years, almost all making organic and natural wines, led by Hirotake Ooka, whose Domaine de Grande Colline wines have a cult following in his homeland.

"Drugs found in fewer than 15 per cent of sniffer dog searches in South Australia
Posted
Drugs have been found on fewer than 15 per cent of South Australians searched after sniffer dogs or electronic tests indicated they were carrying drugs, prompting questions about the legality of the search dogs being used in public areas.
South Australia Police figures show that in 2016-17 police dogs or drug detection systems indicated a person was carrying drugs on 2366 occasions, but drugs were only found on 348 of the people searched.
RMIT criminologist Peta Malins said the low return on the positive indications from the drug detection dogs raised real questions about the legal grounds for police searches.
""To me that does not constitute the grounds for a search,"" Dr Malins said.
""These searches operate outside of court scrutiny because most people are searched and not found with drugs so it doesn't get tested in court and the people found with drugs are often given cautions or diversions so that doesn't get tested either.
""There's no real judicial oversight to determine whether what is going on is fair and that is part of the problem.""
Criminal lawyer Rachael Shaw said the low percentage of searches that found drugs opened the way for lawyers to argue their clients had been illegally searched.
""It could be an argument people could make that there wasn't a proper basis to search them because of the inaccuracy record and statistics in relation to the sniffer dogs,"" Ms Shaw said.
She said the low rate should give the State Government cause to reconsider whether to follow through with its commitment to introduce sniffer dogs in public schools.
""Even with a higher return rate, I have an issue with sniffer dogs being in schools but the fact that there seems to be a high figure of error in the statistics even more so reinforces my view that it's an unnecessary and clearly inaccurate way of detecting drugs in our schools,"" she said.
Education Minister John Gardner said there was ""no question about the government's commitment to deliver its election promise to stop the scourge of drugs in schools"".
""The Education Department, SAPOL and non-government school sectors are currently working together to develop the protocols for visits by drug sniffer dogs, as part of a broader police engagement strategy in our schools,"" Mr Gardner said.
""The policy has a significant educational component, and a number of schools who have received visits by sniffer dogs in the past have reported the experience to be a positive and educative process for the whole school community, whether or not drugs have been found.""
Penalties amount to one person per day
While fewer than 15 per cent of South Australians searched were found with drugs, police data from 2016-17 shows 1605 of the people searched but found with no drugs on them said they had previously been in contact with drugs.
There were 413 people who denied having any contact with drugs.
2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 Drug presence indicated 2087 2956 2616 2030 2366 Drugs found — 496 382 278 348 No drugs found, admit to having previously been in contact with drugs — — 1909 1402 1605 No drugs found, deny any contact with drugs — — 325 350 413
Those found with drugs were issued with a total of 365 arrests or reports, drug diversion notices or fines — equivalent to one person a day for the entire year.
The low success rate of the drug dogs is comparable with figures previously released in New South Wales, where a 2001 Ombudsman's report found that drugs were found in one quarter of drug searches after a positive result from a sniffer dog.
In these cases, a prescribed amount of illegal drugs was found in 1.38 per cent of all indications, with 19 people prosecuted for supply over two years.
Public transport users and city targeted
Police were given 386 authorisations to search in streets, licensed venues and public transport hubs, including the Adelaide Railway Station, the city's western entertainment precinct, the Noarlunga Interchange and Salisbury Interchange.
A further 23 authorisations were given for police to search drug transit routes, including the state's major highways.
Under the Controlled Substances Act 1984, these authorisations can operate for up to 14 days.
Concerns dogs are biased and inaccurate
The reliability of sniffer dogs was placed in the spotlight last month, after NSW Police said they would refuse entry to the Above & Beyond music gig for anyone who sniffer dogs indicated had drugs on them, regardless of whether drugs were actually found after a search.
NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge and anti-sniffer dog group Sniff Off are now considering their legal options to challenge the move by the police.
Dr Malins said her research found that a high number of people who were searched after positive indications by sniffer dogs spoke of being traumatised by the experience.
""I think the dogs are far more accurate in the context of training and assessment and once they're brought out into these public environments where there's a lot of noise, there's chaos, the dogs might get tired or hungry, I think accuracy does shift,"" she said.
""The cues that dogs pick up on from their handlers start to play a bigger role in those environments than they do in training.
""The police present the dogs as being this unbiased tool to hone in on drugs but in reality it's actually a complex interaction with all of these factors going on in this space, including conscious or unconscious police bias.""
She said her research had found that rather than being a deterrent, the presence of drug dogs in public spaces and events meant drug users modified how they transported or used drugs, posing a greater health threat.
""From my research, pretty much everyone I speak to says they don't not use drugs, they just do a whole lot of other moderations to their drug use that tend to be far more harmful, for example shelving drugs or buying drugs inside an event that they don't know, or preloading before a festival,"" Dr Malins said.
""When police are not seen as someone there to keep them safe but as a potential threat, it means people become afraid to seek help for drugs or even violence.""
Declaration of new 'war on drugs'
The analysis of data on police drug dogs searches follows an announcement by the State Government that it intends to dramatically increase penalties for marijuana possession, with the maximum fine quadrupled to $2000.
A new maximum prison sentence of two years would also be introduced — the same as the penalty for drugs such as ecstasy or heroin.
The proposed law changes to be introduced to parliament would also include a restriction on the drug diversion program, allowing people to undertake diversions twice in a four-year period.
Cannabis possession has been decriminalised in South Australia since 1987, with the most common penalty for possessing less than 25 grams a $125 fine.
In the lead-up to the March State Election, the Liberal Party committed to implement a tough on drugs plan that would include allowing police dogs to search public high schools and students' property.

The Queensland Teachers’ Union and the Independent Education Union have spoken of terrifying incidents at schools, including students throwing chairs at teachers and stalking.
PHYSICAL attacks on teachers by students in Queensland schoolyards are on the rise, with shocking data revealing nearly 400 workers compensation claims related to assaults or exposure to violence were lodged in less than a year.
Latest WorkCover data, obtained by The Courier-Mail, show public school staff submitted 359 claims between July 1, 2017, and June 15 this year over assault or exposure to violence.
This was an increase of 55 incidents reported during the previous financial year.
Some 229 claims were made by teachers with 130 claims made by other staff.
The Queensland Teachers’ Union and the Independent Education Union have spoken of terrifying incidents at schools, including students throwing chairs at teachers and stalking.
Both the Queensland Teachers' Union and the Independent Education Union have warned of terrifying incidents at schools, including students throwing chairs at teachers and stalking.
""We've had incidents where teachers have been punched by students, where students have tackled teachers to have access to their FOB keys that give them access to different areas,"" QUT deputy general secretary Kate Ruttiman said.
""We've also had incidents where students have … thrown things hidden under desks.""
An Education Department spokeswoman said the department took a zero tolerance approach to violence in any form and ""fully supports staff in reporting incidences"".
She said principals were responsible for ""the good order and management of their schools"" and had a range of statutory powers they could use to discipline bad behaviour and protect staff and students.
""This includes the power to suspend and exclude students and to ban hostile persons from the school premises,"" she said.
Public school staff submitted 359 claims between July 1, 2017, and June 15 this year over assault or exposure to violence.
The spokeswoman said the department's workforce had grown by about 1000 extra staff in recent years.
Independent Education Union of Australia's Paul Giles said it was concerning that teachers did not feel they could work in a safe environment.
""Fortunately, assaults on teachers are rare however, even one case of harassment or abuse of teachers is too many,"" he said.
""Our union has had cases of stalking of teachers by students and parents.
""We have recently had a member who was struck in the head with a chair by a student after giving a verbal direction.
""The onus is also on the community to respect and support the profession as teachers are tasked with educating their children.""
Education Minister Grace Grace said any assaults on teachers were unacceptable.
""While the increase in incidents and claims may be attributed to an increase in teacher and student numbers, along with the introduction of anti-violence awareness programs - there is certainly no place for violence in our schools,"" she said.
""The health, safety and wellbeing of our teachers and staff is paramount and we will continue to provide them with required support.""",www.news-mail.com.au,2018-07-05 06:39:16,23,86550
"Claims of crime scene issues, forensic delays blighting Tennant Creek toddler rape investigation
Updated
A Northern Territory Police investigation into the alleged rape of a toddler, which drew national attention to Tennant Creek, has many similarities to a ""botched"" homicide investigation, the ABC has learned.
Key points: Police ""mistakes"" led to man spending three months in prison before charges were dropped
Police accused of failing to set up crime scenes, gather and test forensic material, check witness statements and alibis
Allegations of mistakes similar to that of ""botched"" investigation in the death of Sacha Green
Alleged police mistakes led to a man spending three months in prison after being accused of raping a two-year-old girl in the remote town, 450 kilometres north of Alice Springs, before the charges against him were dropped in June.
Another man has since been charged over the February crime, and is due to appear in court this month.
The first man told the ABC that he was in hospital at the time of the alleged rape, but said police did not seek to verify that alibi.
Two other separate sources alleged to the ABC that police failed to secure a crime scene, and that they relied heavily on accounts that they then failed to verify.
They also said there was a delay in getting forensic evidence tested.
Sources, on condition of anonymity, told the ABC that semen found on a nappy did not match the DNA profile of the first man they arrested.
""For a crime that got such attention, you have to wonder why senior police weren't looking over their shoulder, making sure everything was kosher,"" a source said.
The ABC sent NT Police a list of questions, including how long the first man was kept on remand after the DNA evidence suggested he was not responsible.
""Northern Territory Police are unable to comment as there is an ongoing investigation and the matter is currently before the courts,"" a police spokesperson responded.
Alleged mistakes came after coroner looked at 'botched' homicide investigation
The alleged rape occurred after police had already faced difficult questions about their competency at a coronial hearing into the suspicious death of Indigenous woman Sacha Green in 2013.
NT Coroner Greg Cavanagh, in his findings handed down in June, described that investigation as ""botched"" and led by ""inexperienced and incompetent"" police.
The allegations of errors in the toddler rape case are similar to the mistakes made in the Green case, including police not establishing secure crime scenes, not sending off forensic material for testing and taking too long to verify witness statements.
NT Police were slammed in the coroner's report on the Green case, which cited similar mistakes made while investigating the suspicious 2007 death of an Indigenous boy in Borroloola (who cannot be named for cultural reasons) after which police promised to learn from and to improve their investigations.
No one was ever charged over either the Borroloola boy's death or over Ms Green's death.
""What is it about Tennant Creek that these same mistakes keep getting made? Why aren't senior police getting involved?"" said one source.
The fallout from the alleged child rape continues, with federal cabinet ministers Nigel Scullion and Dan Tehan touring the town this week on orders from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who had been criticised for not visiting the town or committing more funding to tackle social dysfunction in remote communities.
There has also been ongoing debate about what sort of restrictions, if any, should be imposed on alcohol sales on the town and the broader Barkly region of the NT.

SUITABLE land for a high school at Emu Park is being investigated by Livingstone Shire Council and it will invite the State Government to make a presentation about its future plans.
The growing population at the southern end of the Capricorn Coast has prompted the call to investigate possible options.
As part of the investigation, a survey is planned in the anticipated catchment area for students to establish the current numbers.

"International scammers target dating websites for 'mules' used to rip off schools and businesses
Posted
Dating websites are being used by international scammers to recruit unwitting mules in their attempts to rip off Australian businesses.
Between January and May, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) received more than 1,000 complaints about ""business email compromise scams"".
The scams have netted more than $2 million, with the average loss about $27,000.
Since March, five schools and businesses in south-west Victoria have been targeted by overseas criminals attempting to steal more than $1 million.
Three of the attempts were successful, netting thieves in excess of $500,000.
ACCC acting chair Delia Rickard said there had been ""a huge spike"" in the scams.
""There's a number of variations but what seems to happen is the scammer hacks into a vendor's or supplier's email account and gets information such as their customer list, their bank details and previous invoices so they know what their style is,"" Ms Rickard said.
""Then your business gets an email that looks like it's from one of your suppliers, and looks like their normal style of invoicing and they ask you for a new form of payment — they might ask you to wire transfer it, or they might ask you to send it to a new bank account.
""The email address will likely almost look identical — there might be a slight difference but it will look like the real thing.
Ms Rickard said the scams were sophisticated.
""They have conned many, many small businesses, councils, schools all around the country,"" she said.
In at least two of the five incidents in south-west Victoria, men in Queensland were recruited through dating websites and asked to set up bank accounts for the scammers under the guise of it being an online girlfriend.
In another similar incident, a man from the Victorian town of Camperdown was duped by a person he thought was his overseas girlfriend into helping rip off a Western Australian business by opening a new account.
Warrnambool police's Detective Senior Constable Craig Wastell said the ""mules"" were often unwitting accomplices.
""It appears [they're] mostly easy targets — a lot of them are [recruited] through dating websites,"" Constable Wastell said.
""They're unwittingly believing they're doing something for someone offshore.
""They're more or less being duped into taking possession of the money and then forwarding it on.""
The cost of the con
The idea that the mules were also being duped was little comfort for victims who had lost thousands of dollars.
Emmanuel College, a private high school in Warrnambool, lost about $400,000 through a scam in May.
Principal Peter Morgan said the impact on the school had been significant.
""If you think about the employee who [transferred the money] as part of his or her normal duties, it's extremely unbalancing, upsetting and disturbing for that individual,"" Mr Morgan said.
""For our school, the impact is a huge setback for the plans we have for the future.""
He said most people did not realise the complexities of the scams and falsely assumed all victims of such ruses had fallen for a simple scam.
""You can't [ignore] the impact of the negative commentary and so on that comes through on social media from people who profess to be well informed and know a lot about these things that really don't but nevertheless are making comments which are extremely harmful and do have an impact on people within our organisation,"" Mr Morgan said.
""They profess to understand exactly how these things happen and that they would be very wise about it and it wouldn't happen to them, but I think that what we've seen is that this can happen to anyone.""
Mr Morgan said it was a very sophisticated form of organised crime.
""We were contacted by email, an email that looked completely legitimate advising us that the banking details of a company that we were working with on a building project … had changed.
""The information seemed credible as did the actual communication, given that the communication was directed precisely to the person within our organisation who would handle our account changes and payments.
""It came across as being extremely legitimate and as a result of that we made a payment to an account that proved to be the account of the scammer.
He said the scammers had gone to the length and expense of creating a domain name that was almost identical to the contractor with whom the school was working with.
""With the benefit of hindsight you can see that there is a difference with an 's' in it — so instead of having 'construction', they had 'constructions',"" Mr Morgan said.
""It's very easy to see that with hindsight, but at the time … everything else appeared to be identical, to the account and the letterhead.""
Hard to catch
But catching the crooks has been no easy task.
The IP addresses of the scammers targeting Warrnambool schools and businesses have been traced to Los Angeles, New Jersey and South Korea, while the unwitting mules in the middle have been scattered around Australia.
""Unfortunately there's not [much we can do], not with the offshore [offenders] — we have to leave it to those parties [like] Interpol,"" Constable Wastell said.
He said Interpol might arrest someone and Australian police and victims would never know.
Ms Rickard said the consumer watchdog could do little beyond preventative measures such as alert businesses and work with financial institutions.
""It's a very big challenge because there is no end of scammers out there and they're very tech-savvy and they keep up to date with all the latest technology, which means they are incredibly clever at pretending to be who they aren't.""

"Of all the stories that emerged from Aurizon's closure of the Rockhampton rail maintenance yards last week, maybe none is more heartbreaking than that of 31-year-old Natalie Dray. Here she tells her story in her own words.
FOR the past 13 years I've had the honour and privilege of working at one of the most historic workshops in all of Queensland, the railway workshops, until May of 2017 when my heart was shattered by corporate greed.
READ MORE HERE: End of the line for Rockhampton's rail maintenance workshops
RELATED: Coal rail tensions gather steam
I was just made redundant and had one year left at the job that I love most. This decision was made purely by corporate greed that is slowly increasing the economic gap between the mega rich and the working class. For over 100 years the workshops have helped this state become what it is.
I must admit privatisation did not help Queensland Rail which in turn had led me to the predicament that I'm in today.
RELATED: Aurizon pushes ahead with plans to roll out of Rocky
For people that do not know me I have Autism. I was once told when in school that being autistic I was never meant to succeed in life and was destined to a life of welfare and living under the care of my parents, but due to hard work from my parents and a few dedicated teachers I was able to obtain an apprenticeship in boiler making at Queensland Rail.
Boilermaker, Natalie Dray Georgie Cowan ROK040718railway1
When I told my mother, she was so happy her first words to me ""that is one less to thing to worry about”. During my apprenticeship I was exposed extensively to the rail industry plus working in some of the oldest buildings in Rockhampton was a treat in itself I was lucky enough to see the turnstile work which was keen interest to me.
In 2009 I had the chance to learn shunting, from my first week shunting out in the rail yard I was hooked I loved it! So, for the past 13 years that has been my life welding wagons and shunting and working with my friends I was happy, I could sleep soundly at night without a care in the world.
Since Mike Carter made his announcement having the thought in the back of my head knowing that on 29/06/2018 that I was no longer going to do the job I love, my parents were devastated and worried about my future.
For someone who has Autism it's hard to find a job that just clicks with you and as much as I like to think employers believe in diversity it's still not evident in the workplaces today, this past year I've been living in a nightmare which I feel is only going to get worse.
This closure has affected my mental health, I'm now scared that I'm never going to find stable employment which is the best for someone with Autism because I like to plan things right down to T.
All I'm hoping that someone out gives me another chance to do something that I love to do and to move on with my life, Queensland Rail gave me a chance while Aurizon took that away from me.

"Deputy Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police Paul Mills addresses the media outside the Bowman Centre community hall, after two people were hospitalised in Amesbury, Wiltshire, Britain, on Wednesday.
By Henry Nicholls
Two British citizens were critically ill in hospital on Wednesday after they were poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent which struck down a former Russian agent and his daughter in March, Britain's top counter-terrorism officer said.
The British pair, a 44-year-old woman and a 45-year-old man, were hospitalised after being found unwell on Saturday in Amesbury, just a few miles from Salisbury where ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were attacked in March.
""I have received test results from Porton Down [military research centre] which show that the two people have been exposed to the nerve agent Novichok,"" Neil Basu, Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer, told reporters.
UK counter-terrorism police are now leading the investigation, though Basu said it was unclear how the two people came into contact with the nerve agent or whether they had been specifically targetted.
Amesbury is just seven miles (11 km) north of Salisbury, where the Skripals were found slumped unconscious on a bench on March 4.
Police have cordoned off at least five different areas, including a park and a property in Salisbury, and a pharmacy and a Baptist church community centre in Amesbury although health chiefs said the risk to the public was low.
Britain accused Russia of poisoning Skripal with Novichok nerve agent, the first known offensive use of such a chemical weapon on European soil since World War Two.
The attack prompted the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the Cold War as allies in Europe and the United States sided with Prime Minister Theresa May's view that Moscow was either responsible or had lost control of the nerve agent.
Russia denied any involvement and suggested Britain had carried out the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.
Moscow has hit back by expelling Western diplomats, questioning how Britain knows that Russia was responsible and offering its rival interpretations, including that it amounted to a plot by British secret services.
Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said the government's emergency response committee had met to discuss the incident.
Paramedics were called on Saturday morning to a house in Amesbury after the woman collapsed and returned later in the day when the man also fell ill.
The pair, who are being treated at Salisbury District Hospital, were initially believed to have taken heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch but tests showed they had been poisoned with Novichok, a nerve agent developed by the Soviet military in the Cold War.
""We are not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to,"" Basu said. ""The possibility that these two investigations might be linked is clearly a line of enquiry for us.""
The hospital is where the Skripals also spent weeks in a critical condition before slowly recovering and being discharged.
Russia has said it does not possess such nerve agents, did not develop Novichok, and President Vladimir Putin dismissed as nonsense the notion that Moscow would have poisoned Skripal and his daughter.

Americans celebrated their nation's 242nd anniversary of independence on Wednesday, with concerts, parades and a voracious display of hot dog-eating prowess in New York, as many cities and towns prepared for traditional fireworks displays after sundown.
At the White House, President Donald Trump hosted a picnic for military families on the South Lawn during the afternoon, a few hours before fireworks were scheduled to light up the National Mall.
Independence Day festivities scheduled for Washington featured a concert by the National Symphony Orchestra on the lawn of the Capitol. ""Margaritaville"" singer Jimmy Buffett, The Temptations, The Beach Boys and Luke Combs will also perform.
The Fourth of July holiday marks the adoption of the Declaration of Independence by congressional delegates in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776.
The document declared the young nation's independence from Great Britain and advanced the principle ""that all men are created equal,"" and had ""certain unalienable rights"" including ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""
More than two centuries later, however, it was the pursuit of hot dogs that defined the holiday at Coney Island on the waterfront of New York's borough of Brooklyn, where Nathan's Famous held its 46th annual hot dog-eating contest.
Joey Chestnut once again dominated the competitive eating spectacle. The 34-year-old from San Jose, California, won his 11th ""Mustard Belt"" by downing an astonishing 74 wieners -topping the record of 72 he set last year.
In the women's division, Miki Sudo, 32, of Las Vegas, won her fifth title by putting away 37 hot dogs.
Heat and humidity hung over the competition, as well as much of the country. The National Weather Service issued heat advisories for the Plains states eastward to the Mid-Altantic region. Temperatures were expected in the 90s with the humidity making it feel like 105 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (40-43 degrees Celsius).
On a day that features countless patriotic parades nationally, the pro gun control group Moms Demand Action held several marches around the country, including one in Webster Groves, Missouri, where Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill joined them.
""It was hot! But wonderful,"" McCaskill said on Twitter.
New York is preparing to put on an evening fireworks display that ranks as the country's largest, according to Macy's, the retailer that sponsors the annual event.
More than 3 million spectators and 12 million television viewers are expected to watch 75,000 shells illuminate the night sky over the East River to the music of singer Kelly Clarkson.
Bostonians will celebrate with the Boston Pops along the Charles River, joined by pop vocalist Rachel Platten.
Los Angeles is also planning fireworks, as well as a concert and other celebrations at the Hollywood Bowl. Up the coast, San Franciscans can watch fireworks on the bay near the Golden Gate Bridge, if fog does not obscure the show.
In recent years, law enforcement agencies have been on the alert for suspicious activity during the holiday celebrations. Officials said they were taking extra precautions this year, but have not detected any credible security threats.
An Ohio man was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of planning to detonate a bomb at Cleveland's Fourth of July celebrations.

"Balmain Bowling Club faces an uncertain future as it heads towards 150th milestone
Posted
Sydney's oldest lawn bowls club in inner city Balmain has warned it may not reach its 150th anniversary as it faces cripplingly high rates and maintenance costs.
Balmain Bowling Club's position is typical of many small bowling clubs across New South Wales and Australia, despite lawn bowls' ongoing popularity and competitive success.
What is lawn bowls? A precision sport where the aim is to roll an asymmetrical or weighted ball towards a small white ball called a jack or a kitty
To win, get the ball closer to the jack or kitty than your opponent is able to
Normally played on an outdoors bowling green with a grass or turf surface
To bowl, players stand on a white mat placed on a line down the centre of the rink
Curious Sydney investigated the issue after Bettina Tan, 26, from Campsie in Sydney's inner west asked: Why do we have so many lawn bowls clubs? And why have so many fallen into disrepair?
""I see so many clubs around, pretty much one in every suburb. I just want to know why it's not as popular as it used to be,"" Ms Tan said.
Sydney has about 100 lawn bowls clubs, but 89 have closed across NSW in just the last ten years as the game tries to fight the perception that it's 'an old person's sport'.
In the days when lawn bowls became popular, there was plenty of space and real estate was cheap.
But closure has become more common with reduced membership numbers due to an ageing population and demand for space in the city at a premium.
'Rich with history'
Balmain Bowling Club, opened in 1880, owns its own property in the inner Sydney suburb, smack bang in the middle of the former industrial area where land prices are exorbitant.
And because of the way the club is zoned, it could pay rates of $65,000 this financial year to the Inner West Council.
By contrast, Gladstone Park Bowling Club, just 500 metres down the road, paid a 'peppercorn rent' of $14,500 last financial year because of different zoning.
Across the state local councils are eyeing off the well-placed and quite large spaces occupied by clubs for other uses like housing or childcare facilities.
Balmain is fighting for its life despite its important place in history, because although it's had a successful membership drive, maintenance costs are soaring.
""Our land which we own is extraordinarily valuable and we're trying to raise some capital against that to ensure that we continue into the future and make our 150-year milestone,"" Balmain board member Paul Cooper says.
""Outside of the fact that it's the oldest bowling club in NSW, our area of Balmain is rich with history and these types of thing once gone, are gone forever.""
Because of a historical anomaly some clubs are facing enormous financial pressure, paying much higher rates than other comparable community clubs.
Inner West Council Mayor Darcy Byrne says his council is offering a number of options, including rezoning the land to prohibit development, a reduction in rates, or recompense through a grants scheme.
""We have to fight to find a solution to ensure it and other clubs like it remain viable into the future. [Labor politician] Tom Uren, the most famous son of Balmain — his wake was held at Balmain Bowling Club,"" he said.
""That sort of history cannot be thrown out the back door.""
An explosion in popularity
There was steady growth in lawn bowls after its inception in the 1800s, but the real explosion in lawn bowls clubs happened across NSW after WWII.
There were about 800 clubs across the state at the height of its popularity according to the authors of a book celebrating 125 years of lawn bowls in NSW, John Archer and Rex Davies.
""The thing was that after the diggers came back from the war, alcohol was very hard to come by, the pubs closed early and they wanted to take up a sport,"" Mr Davies said.
""Bowling clubs have always been at the heart of the community, because they've always had halls and meeting venues, and they've been the focal place for wedding receptions and all sorts of community activities.""
""The clubs proliferated well into 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and even in the 1980s there were over 100,000 bowlers in NSW,"" Mr Archer said.
But as society has changed and the game's followers have aged, clubs have closed and those that are left have had to change direction to attract a new generation.
Barefoot bowls and a business model
Membership numbers in NSW 485 members aged under 18
About 1,500 members aged between 18 and 34
More than 11,000 aged 65 to 74, and 11,235 aged over 75
Total membership 38,546
Currently 100 clubs in Sydney and 508 Clubs across NSW
89 closures across state in past decade
Figures courtesy Royal NSW Bowling Association
Many clubs have found new members after embracing barefoot bowls, a more relaxed approach to the game allowing participants to wear what they like and play in a non-competitive way.
And some, in conjunction with RSLs or League's clubs, have freed up a bowling green for a beer garden alongside a restaurant or bistro.
So it is for Sydney's second oldest lawn bowls club, North Sydney Greens, which opened in 1888.
Board member Michael Andersch says this new business model is a sharp contrast to the world when lawn bowls was in its heyday, when mostly men played and they could spend their leisure time how they pleased.
""We managed to find a stock book from 1959 in the club archives and I think that reflected a time when there were 29 different scotch whiskeys supplied and about 12 different brandies that were available across the bar,"" he said.
""So I think maybe a reflection on the Mad Men era.""
Not just 'an old person's sport'
When you think of lawn bowls you probably think of older men and women in their pristine white uniforms on the green, sedately enjoying a proper English gentlemen's game with their friends.
Australia's competitive lawn bowlers Aaron Wilson, 26, won a gold medal in the men's singles at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and is high performance coach at Sydney's Cabramatta club
Kelsey Cottrell, 27, from Sydney's St Johns Park club, won gold at the Commonwealth Games in the fours team with Natasha Scott, Rebecca Van Asch and Carla Krizanic
Barrie Lester, 36, from Victoria has made more than 130 international appearances, and won two silver medals in the triples and the fours teams at this year's Commonwealth Games
In 2018, Jake Fehlberg was the youngest member of the Australian team at 23, while Lynne Seymour, 67, and Ken Hanson, 68, were the oldest
But now, plenty of younger men and women are enjoying enormous success on a competitive level.
""Our state side is younger than the Australian cricket side as far as players go, so it's a bit of myth that it's an old person's sport,"" Mr Archer says.
""They're much more vibrant the way they play, much more colourful than in the old days, now they've even transferred to coloured bowling balls,"" Mr Davies said.
Examples include Kelsey Cottrell, 27, from St Johns Park club in Sydney, who made history as the youngest player in the game to represent Australia at the age of 15.
Aaron Wilson, 26, from Cabramatta Bowls club in Sydney's west, won gold in the men's singles at this year's Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.
Sense of community
Bowling clubs have historically been a focal point for community activities, and there are those who see their decline as a tremendous loss, particularly for older people seeking companionship and exercise.
""Sport has the ability to breaks down barriers of ethnicity and age, ability, all sorts of things and through breaking down those barriers you can create tight knit communities,"" sports administrator Peter Robertson says.
""We seem to have lost the relevance of that in the conversation at times and I think we'll be the poorer for having lost those really important social structures in the community so I think we need to protect them.""
Balmain's Paul Cooper says he hopes a compromise can be reached to allow the historic club to not just survive, but thrive.
""The club is a meeting place of locals. It is the fabric of how Balmain exists as a village,"" he said.
Inner West Council Mayor Darcy Byrne says local councils need to work more closely in repurposing lawn bowls clubs to ensure their future.
""They may not have as many lawn bowlers as they've had in the past, but there's no reason that through a combination of live music, hospitality and a family-friendly environment that we can't change bowling clubs and other community clubs and future-proof them for the century to come,"" he said.
Who asked the question? Photo: Curious questioner Bettina Tan enjoyed learning how to bowl at North Sydney Greens Bowling Club. (ABC News: Sue Daniel) Bettina Tan, 26 from Campsie has never played lawn bowls but she might be part of the new generation who do after a lesson with long-time bowler Michael Andersch. Ms Tan grew up in Beverley Hills with a lawn bowls club just down the road — long since turned into a childcare centre. ""I do see a couple [of clubs] that seem like they've been abandoned, clearly people haven't been inside for a long time,"" she said. ""It is sad because they could be used for public space, gentrified or regenerated to stay relevant today.""

"The Apolong is designed to run at airports and tourist spots
By -
China's internet giant Baidu announced Wednesday it had begun mass producing the country's first autonomous mini-bus, as the firm prepares to roll them out in tourist spots and airports.
CEO Robin Li watched the 100th vehicle roll off a production line of a factory in the southeastern city of Xiamen.
""2018 marks the first year of commercialisation for autonomous driving. From the mass production of Apolong, we can truly see that autonomous driving is making great strides -- taking the industry from zero to one,"" said the CEO.
The 14-seater Apolong, about one-third of the size of a normal bus, has no steering wheel, driver's seat, accelerator or brake.
Co-produced by Baidu and Chinese bus manufacturer King Long, they will soon be pressed into commercial use in enclosed areas such as tourist areas and airports in several cities including Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and the country's new megacity Xiong'an.
Early next year, they are set to enter Japan's self-driving market as shuttle buses at nuclear power stations or in Tokyo to ferry around elderly people in local communities.
The vehicles have the ""fourth level"" of automation as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, meaning they can operation within an enclosed location without human intervention.
This is one short of the highest level, where vehicles can operate anywhere on the road.
""I took a self-driving car to come to the developer conference last year, and ended up getting a ticket at (Beijing's) fifth ring road,"" Li quipped.
Baidu, often referred to as China's Google, operates the country's leading search engine and also invests heavily in services ranging from online payments to connected devices and artificial intelligence.
""In the past, China exported cheap commodities to the world. In the future, China will export AI technology to the world,"" Li said at the firm's annual AI developer conference.
He also announced a new AI chip called Kunlun at the conference, which can support a wide range of AI applications including voice recognition, natural language processing and autonomous driving.

Jasmine has been competing since she was eight, but started taking the sport seriously and travelling from age 12.
Since the 2018 season began in April, Jasmine has travelled 8000km to competitions.
And with her coach based in Gatton, near Toowoomba, the cost to her family is enormous.
""We fly her coach up here, then there's coaching fees,” Kaylene said.
""Or Jasmine goes down there and stays with her coach, which means she can't work.
""When she travels to compete there's a loss of income to her and to us.”
Alongside her Olympic dream, Jasmine is doing her own coaching accreditation and her mother says if the opportunity was there to coach on the Capricorn Coast, ""she would love it”.
""She's fantastic with little kids and she's been a pony club instructor for a long time,” Kaylene said.
The Capricorn Equestrian Group has 91 members, mostly from Rockhampton and Yeppoon but extending from Cairns to Miriam Vale.
Three championships are held each year in show jumping, dressage and eventing, plus smaller events and practice days.
Yesterday, two more of the groups members were crowned Queensland State Interschool Champions.
Tayla Wallace and Holly Tomkins are now guaranteed a place in the Queensland side to compete at the National Titles in October where Jasmine will also compete in her first chance at securing an Australian title.",www.themorningbulletin.com.au,2018-07-05 06:08:00,16,464377
"Mock pirate swords, bows and arrows and even Lego weapons have also been outlawed by childcare operators in a bid to curb “aggressive” play.
Mock pirate swords, bows and arrows and even Lego weapons have also been outlawed by childcare operators in a bid to curb “aggressive” play.
CHILDCARE centres are banning children from playing games such as ""cops and robbers"" with toy guns and plastic fake knives because of fears they promote violent ""warlike"" behaviour.
Mock pirate swords, bows and arrows and even Lego weapons have also been outlawed by childcare operators in a bid to curb ""aggressive"" play.
No laws or regulations cover toy weapons in childcare centres or preschools but The Daily Telegraph can reveal ­ ­industry peak body, Australian Childcare Alliance NSW will this week survey its 1600 childcare centres for policies on warlike toy weapons including replica guns and knives.
Australian Childcare Alli­ance NSW President Lyn Connolly said if a child was to make a Lego gun from blocks, for example, educators should discuss with the child ""why it's not good to have guns and how they can hurt people"".
That's despite parents expressing concerns that the ""politically correct"" ­restrictions could hinder children's imaginative play and physical games as well as ­experts disputing claimed links between the toys and ­detrimental changes in child conduct.
Just last month, controversy erupted in the UK when Prince George was photographed playing with a pretend pistol.
Child psychologist Dr Justin Coulson said there was no evidence to suggest playing with guns changed the behaviour of children, who instead should be allowed to run with their imaginations.
""The current evidence suggests that playing with toy guns will have essentially no measurable impact on a child's attitudes or behaviours,"" he said, but added that there was not a lot of high quality ­research in this area.
""Even if we were to ban guns, kids will find other things to use if they want to play a 'goodies versus baddies' game.
""They will pick up sticks if you take away the toy gun and then the stick becomes a gun.
""While I personally don't like it when kids play with replica guns and I have a personal and moral distaste, there is no evidence to suggest it causes any problems.""
Ms Connolly said commonsense usually prevailed but the alliance would ask if any childcare service needed ""guidance, support or policies on how to handle children and their parents who innocently bring … toy guns, toy pirate swords, bows and arrows"" or other mock weapons.
""Childcare centres always try to reinforce safety and positivity into the lives of all the children in our care,"" she said.
""Australians generally are averse to guns.
""Early childhood education and care centres believe in ­exploration, not expiration and in development, not ­destroying, so zero tolerance is the norm for violent behaviour and weapons.
""I cannot think of a single childcare centre which has toy guns or even software apps with guns in them in their ­environment or uses them as part of their educational ­equipment.""
Early Childhood Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said the NSW Department of Education had the ability to take regulatory action against services that used toys that threatened the safety of children.
""It is up to the discretion of individual services to ensure toys are age-appropriate and are acceptable for their children and families,"" she said.
""Toys that are used in the services should be used to aid play-based learning for educational purposes and I would expect services right across the state to make sensible ­decisions about the toys available to their children.""
However, Australian Childcare Alliance vice-president Nesha Hutchinson said in rural and remote areas toy guns often were used as a teaching tool as kids who lived on farms saw their parents handling real weapons.
""They learn about safety and how you lock it up (the gun) overnight and sign it in and out just as mum and dad do,"" she said.
A number of parents have reacted angrily to news of the restrictions and survey, inclu­ding Chatswood father Brendan Egan, who described the toy gun ban as ""overkill"".
Mr Egan, 40, said his four-year-old son Mitchell had never turned violent or aggressive when playing with his plastic pistols.
""I'm comfortable with him using the guns at childcare. I'm sure he uses them in a playful way instead of a really violent way,"" Mr Egan said.
""He plays with guns and swords with Star Wars just like we did when we were kids.
""He sees guns and weapons on cartoons all the time and he associates them with fun, not really with violence.""
A mum who did not wish to be identified said she believed violent video games were more harmful than a ""little plastic gun"", while Dr Coulson also warned about the dangers of on-screen content.
""I am terribly uncomfortable with violent content on our screens and there is far more evidence that this is predictive of children's violent and aggressive behaviours,"" he said.
""We are focused on the wrong things and should be encouraging our children to play creatively and ­imaginatively.""
Education developmental psychologist Dr Rose Cantali said it was important to allow children to express themselves, but ""in moderation"".",www.dailyexaminer.com.au,2018-07-05 06:02:52,33,692302
"A couple who fell seriously ill near the English town of Amesbury were poisoned with the same Novichok nerve agent used in the Skripal incident, British police confirmed on Wednesday.
The Skripal case caused a rift between the UK and Russia, after the UK concluded that the nerve agent used was Soviet-made. Moscow denied the claim and the confrontation led to an exchange of diplomat expulsions between both countries.
What we know so far:
The victims are a 45-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman, who were discovered unconscious on Saturday at a house in a quiet neighborhood of Amesbury.
The couple are in a critical condition in the same UK hospital where Sergei Skripal and his daughter Julia were treated earlier this year.
Amesbury is 12 kilometers (8 miles) from Salisbury, where the Skripals were poisoned.
Local police have established two help lines to take calls from those who may have concerns about a possible contamination.
Counter-terrorism police are now handling the case.
No danger to public
Neil Basu, Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer, told reporters it was unclear how they came into contact with the nerve agent or whether they had been specifically targetted.
A Downing Street spokesperson said the incident was being treated ""with the utmost seriousness.""
England's Chief Medical Officer said the risk to the general public remained low.

"As the US continues to move forward on diplomatic negotiations with North Korea, assessments from US intelligence agencies and several reports from satellite imagery analysts emerged this week providing evidence that Pyongyang is continuing to expand weapons production capability, which Washington says poses a threat to the US and its allies in Asia.
Some of the reports suggested that the Kim regime was expanding weapons production facilities even as it made tentative statements promising to ""denuclearize"" in the run up to the June 12 summit in Singapore between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump.
Read more: Opinion: Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un's summit of friendliness
A report published recently by NBC News, citing unnamed US officials, said US intelligence agencies ""believe North Korea has increased production of fuel for nuclear weapons at multiple secret sites in recent months and may try to hide these while seeking concessions in talks with the United States.""
Another US official was quoted saying there is ""absolutely unequivocal evidence"" that North Korea was trying to ""deceive"" the US.
""The intelligence community assessment that North Korea is taking steps to deceive the United States would be consistent with regime behavior during all previous diplomatic negotiations,"" Bruce Klinger, a former CIA division chief for Korea and senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, told DW.
However, Klinger emphasized that expanding production of fissile material did not violate the US-North Korea joint declaration signed in Singapore. ""No real denuclearization agreement has yet been reached,"" he said.
""As the US seeks to put meat on the meager bones of the Singapore Communique, it needs to emulate the lengthy, detailed treaty text and robust verification regimes of arms control treaties with the Soviet Union rather than the flawed North Korean agreements of the past,"" added Klinger.

'Very clear' expectations from Washington
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is heading to North Korea on Thursday for the first round of talks following the June summit. According to a US State Department press briefing, the visit will center on ""consultations with the North Korean government"" about what Trump and Kim ""agreed to"" in Singapore.
State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert said that North Korea was ""very clear"" in terms of US expectations and Secretary Pompeo would be ""very blunt"" in what he ""expects from the North Koreans.""
Read more: Mike Pompeo: US ready to help make North Korea rich if it gives up nukes
Pompeo tweeted before the Singapore summit that the US remained ""committed to the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."" This is commonly referred to as ""CIVD.""
After the summit on June 13, he told reporters in Seoul, ""I hope we'll see — you used the term 'major disarmament' — yes, we're hopeful that we can achieve that in the next two and a half years.""
""Secretary of State Pompeo will need to get Pyongyang to publicly and unambiguously embrace the CVID concept and accept extensive inspections if the Trump administration is going to achieve real denuclearization,"" said analyst Klinger.
'Complete denuclearization?'
President Trump's statements since the Singapore summit indicate the administration wants to capitalize on the political significance of the meeting. While dialogue itself is a breakthrough, there has yet to be any indication that North Korea is diminishing its weapons program, despite concessions from the US.
Directly after the summit, Trump tweeted that ""there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea."" Yesterday, the US leader declared, ""If not for me, we would be at war with North Korea.""
Despite Trump's assertions, a recent report released by 38 North, a North Korea research and analysis website run by the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, concluded that Pyongyang was carrying out upgrades to North Korea's Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center.
The report said that ""commercial satellite imagery from June 21"" indicated ""improvements to the infrastructure"" at Yongbyon were ""continuing at a rapid pace."" This included the completion of a cooling system for the plutonium production reactor.
Slowing down production?
Jenny Town, Managing Editor at 38 North, told DW that it would be incorrect to assume that Pyongyang would slow down its weapons production capability ahead of any agreements with the US. The pace of North Korea's scaling down of weapons production would depend on the content and outcome of negotiations, all of which remain uncertain.
""The only definitive take away from the imagery is that work, which had started at these sites prior to the summit, did not stop immediately. It would have been actually quite surprising if it had,"" said Town, adding that new unpublished imagery acquired on Tuesday by 38 North appears to show that work at the site had slowed.
""We would expect that trend to continue and no new projects to be started,"" she said, adding that work at the major facilities should ""begin to slow or stop as negotiations progress.""

""However, until the agreement is settled, I would expect that some level of activity at these sites, even if it's just for maintenance, is likely to continue.""
Another image analysis released on July 2, by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, shows that North Korea is expanding an important missile production site at the Chemical Material Institute in Hamhung. According to the report, the facility produces essential parts for solid-fueled missiles, including the Pukgugsong series.
Unrealistic timelines from the US
On Sunday, President Trump's National Security Advisor John Bolton told CBS that the US could ""move very quickly"" and that Secretary Pompeo would discuss with the North Koreans ""how to dismantle all of their weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs in a year.""
Experts say this assessment vastly underestimates the state of North Korea's capability.
""North Korea's nuclear program and program infrastructure is quite extensive with many unknowns,"" said Town, adding that technical experts with deep knowledge of North Korea's nuclear program give estimates of between five and 10 years to ""engineer complete, verifiable dismantling of the nuclear and ballistic missile infrastructure.""
Read more: SIPRI: Nuclear weapons are still being developed
""Politically, there is no trust between the US and North Korea. Pyongyang would therefore be reluctant to dismantle its core nuclear capabilities and become vulnerable to US (and South Korean) policy shifts in the future, especially as administrations change,"" she said.
""Despite Trump's claim that 'there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea,' there has been no diminution in Pyongyang's arsenal or programs,"" said Klinger.
""The regime continues to have an estimated arsenal of more than 30 nuclear weapons, missiles that can already threaten South Korea and Japan with nuclear weapons and, according to then-CIA Director and current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is only a 'handful of months' away from having the ability to target the entire United States with nuclear weapons,"" he added.

"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is no fan of refugees and not one to mince words.
In September 2015, he declared: ""European politicians, who spark migrants' hopes of finding a better life in Europe, encouraging them to leave everything behind and risk their lives to come here, are irresponsible. If Europe does not return to the path of reason, it will go under.""
Orban made this statement at the height of the refugee crisis. He was the first European leader to close his country's border with barbed wire — to prevent new arrivals from getting in. That step solidified Orban's reputation as a hardliner.
Read more: Viktor Orban: Era of 'liberal democracy' is over
Railing against refugees
Few of his compatriots were surprised by their leader's tough stance. Orban, who co-founded and presently leads Hungary's national-conservative Fidesz party, has been serving as the country's prime minister since 2010. He also led Hungary between 1998 and 2002. In the beginning, many considered Orban a liberal. In recent years, however, he has shifted markedly to the right, putting anti-refugee policies at the top of his agenda. He is also no stranger to fearmongering, comparing migration to a Trojan horse that breeds terrorism in Europe. He is eager to preserve Hungary's ethnic homogeneity and explicitly warns against ""mixing races.""
It's little wonder then that Orban officially opposes EU quotas to relocate refugees throughout the bloc. His position sparked massive protests and court cases, with Brussels even launching an infringement procedure against Budapest. Although earlier this year, Hungarian authorities admitted they had taken in 1,300 refugees in 2017 — which corresponds to Hungary's EU quota.
Popular at home and abroad
Orban's uncompromising approach has earned him a loyal following at home. In Hungary's parliamentary elections on April 8, the Fidesz party scored a major victory. Together with its coalition partner, the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP), the governing parties command a two-thirds majority in parliament.
While Orban faces opposition from left-leaning politicians, he can also count on numerous foreign supporters. He has been a regular guest at the Bavarian Christian Social Union's (CSU) annual closed-door summit, and since October 2016, Orban and Horst Seehofer — the CSU party leader and German interior minister — even seem to be on a first-name basis. Indeed, Orban even declared Fidesz and the CSU were ""brothers in arms.""
Blowing things out of proportion
There is a huge discrepancy between Orban's fierce anti-refugee rhetoric and the reality in EU. Only about 2.3 million refugees live across the bloc's 28 member states, which together have a total population of more than 500,000 million inhabitants. Refugees, therefore, make up just 0.45 percent of the population.
These figures are even lower in Hungary. Currently, only several hundred asylum-seekers are housed in purpose-built transit centers on the Hungarian-Serbian border. According to official reports, some 3,350 individuals applied for asylum in Hungary last year. Most of these individuals hail from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. While some 1,000 of them were granted temporary subsidiary protection, only about 100 were granted asylum. They are allowed to remain in the country and live in a refugee shelter and will have access to health care services. After one month, however, they will have to fend for themselves.
In Hungary, there are just six refugees per 10,000 inhabitants. In Germany, for comparison, there are 177 refugees per 10,000 inhabitants.
Despite these limited numbers of refugees, Orban's state visit to Germany will focus on the question of migration. Orban takes issue with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's policy-making, which he made abundantly clear at a press conference in Brussels in 2017: ""We're facing a German problem, not a European problem.""

"Poland and Israel have used full-page ads in German newspapers, including the conservative daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, to praise their countries' ties and comment on Poland's controversial Holocaust law.
The so-called ""joint declaration"" begins by stating that ""for 30 years, relations between our countries and peoples have been built on a solid foundation of trust and understanding"" and goes on to say both nations are united by a ""deep, long-lasting friendship"" marked by ""mutual respect for the identity and historical sensitivity of our tragic past."" The ad was published in the name of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki.
Poland's divisive Holocaust law
The ad signals a warming of ties after tension had arisen between both countries over Poland's controversial Holocaust law. Passed in early 2018, the law instantly drew condemnation from Israel, the United States and Ukraine.
It stipulated fines and jail sentences of up to three years for individuals who ""publicly and in denial of the facts"" blame Poles or the Polish state for carrying full or partial responsibility for crimes committed by Nazi Germany.
Read more: Auschwitz: Evolution of a death camp and Holocaust memorial
Critics feared the law would prevent Holocaust survivors and historians from researching the role that some Poles played in Germany's genocide against the Jews.
Relations between Poland and Israel were so fraught that Netanyahu accused Poland of trying to rewrite history and possibly even deny the Holocaust.
Six months later, at Morawiecki's behest, Poland revised the law and cut any reference to possible jail sentences.
Why publish in the German press?
That Poland and Israel would buy such an ad in the German press may, at first glance, appear surprising. But it isn't really, according to Manuel Sarrazin, a member of Germany's Green party who chairs the German-Polish parliament group.
""It is important for Germany that Poland and Israel are on good terms,"" he said, adding that the ad indicates both sides have resumed friendly relations.
He welcomed efforts from Poland and Israel to intensify their dialogue over their shared history.
""In Germany, we need to realize that Poland's domestic debate [regarding the Holocaust] is also partly due to German media, which failed to distance itself from its own, revisionist portrayals of history,"" he said. German media has occasionally mistakenly referred to Nazi concentration camps in occupied Poland as ""Polish death camps.""
The Polish-Israeli ad states that it is ""clear the Holocaust represents an unprecedented crime committed by Nazi Germany against the Jews and all Poles of Jewish descent"" and adds that Poland ""has always shown it fully understands the significance of the Holocaust.""
But the ad also concedes: ""We recognize that there were horrific acts committed by Poles against Jews during World War II, and we condemn every one of these.""
At the same time, the ad highlights the ""heroic actions of many Poles,"" who risked their own lives to save Jews.",www.taiwannews.com.tw,2018-07-05 06:02:00,19,1243
"Romania's lower house of parliament voted 168 to 97 in favor of controversial changes to the country's penal code on Wednesday.
The amendments were approved at lightning speed — passing through the legislative process within a week — and come on the heels of a Supreme Court decision finding ruling Social Democrat party leader Liviu Dragnea guilty on charges of abuse of office.
A look at the changes
Abuse of office is no longer a crime under certain circumstances.
Prosecutors must now have to prove without a doubt that the defendant committed the deed for his or her own benefit, or to benefit their close relatives.
Officials who make less than 1,900 lei (€407; $476) while committing their crime would not be prosecuted.
The maximum jail sentence for abuse of office has been knocked down from seven to five years.
Those convicted of abuse of office who are over 60-years-old would now only serve a third of their prison sentence.
How this could impact
Dragnea's conviction
The 55-year-old leader of the ruling Social Democrats was found guilty by the Supreme Court last month of inciting others to commit an abuse of office. He was sentenced to three and a half years in prison.
The case concerned a fake jobs scandal, where he kept two women on the payroll of a state agency from 2006-2013 although they were employed by his party at the time.
Dragnea, considered to be Romania's most powerful politician, would stand to benefit from the rule changes since he was not found guilty of committing a crime that benefited himself or any of his close relatives.
Left-wing coalition defends reforms:
President decries 'dictatorship' of ruling party:
The left-wing ruling coalition has said the reforms are necessary to stop ""abuses"" from parts of the judiciary. They argue that Romania has a much harsher criminal law compared to other European Union member states and the changes will help prevent people from going to prison for minor crimes.Romanian President Klaus Iohannis slammed the parliament's decision on Wednesday. He and the center-right opposition contest that the penal code reforms are an attempt to overturn Dragnea's prison sentence.
""What we've seen these days is called dictatorship of the majority and is profoundly harmful for democracy,"" Iohannis said in a statement.
EU voices concern:
A spokesman with the European Commission said it will examine the final text of the bill to see if it is compatible with EU law. He said the European Commission ""will not hesitate to take action where necessary to ensure such compatibility.""
Last week, 12 countries issued a joint warning to Romania that the proposed judicial reforms could ""impede international law enforcement cooperation."" Anti-corruption investigators in Romania have said over 200 corruption cases involving abuse of office could be thrown out under the new reforms.
Latest round of judicial reforms:
What happens next:
In June, parliament also passed another raft of laws that altered the penal code, including limiting criminal investigations to one year and forcing courts to throw out certain types of wiretapping evidence. The amendments also limit the number of offences for which a suspect can be held in pre-trial detention.The bill will not likely go into effect for now, as Iohannis would be the one to sign it into law and he shows no interest in doing so. The president and the opposition have said they will challenge the bill at the constitutional court.

"The Aussie dollar rollercoaster (explained for economic amateurs)
Updated
The Australian dollar is special. It's one of the most highly traded currencies in the developed world — and one of the most volatile.
It goes up, down or holds steady because of a wide range of factors: everything from interest rates to Donald Trump, described by one finance expert as a ""walking geopolitical event"".
Its movement affects us all — and it goes much deeper than the link between the exchange rate and how many items are in our online shopping carts.
So what's driving its rollercoaster ride? Let's start with something (relatively) simple: why it's traded so much.
A highly traded currency
Australia is the 13th largest economy in the world, so it's a bit surprising to hear that our dollar is about the fifth most traded currency.
Part of the reason for that is because Australia trades internationally — a lot.
""We sell a lot of raw materials like iron ore and coal,"" says Richard Holden, a professor of economics at the University of New South Wales.
""We even sell quite a lot of education, our third largest export industry, and we buy a lot of stuff.
""We're very open, we trade a great deal and therefore our currency is used a lot.""
That, he says, makes it important for banks around the world to hold ""a reasonable amount"" of Australian dollars in reserve.
Our time zone is another factor.
Because Australia's awake when Europe and North America are asleep, currencies are traded through Sydney, which means the AUD is traded a great deal.
""That explains its rather high ranking on the ladder of the most traded currencies,"" says Dirk Bauer, a professor of accounting and finance from the University of Western Australia.
And once you're a highly traded currency, that quality becomes self-fulfilling.
""It's sort of like a chicken and egg thing: because it's so heavily traded it's an attractive market to get into, because it seems to be one that you can pretty readily get out of,"" explains Adrian Rollins, an economics writer who contributes to In The Black magazine.
So: we're in the market, in the right time zone, and it's easy to get in and out of Aussie dollars. That all adds up.
But what determines the value of the dollar?
There's a number of factors that influence what the Aussie dollar is worth at any given time. Rollins calls it a ""shifting smorgasbord"".
The biggest single factor on the menu, in the long-term, is interest rate differentials — the difference between the interest rates of two countries. Let's take America as an example.
""If interest rates in Australia are very high relative to the US, that makes it attractive for investors to take their US dollars, come buy Australian dollars and invest in, say, Australian government bonds,"" Professor Holden says.
""And, of course, that causes them to sell US dollars [and] buy Australian dollars, changing the difference in supply and demand between the two currencies and shifting the Australian dollar up.""
This isn't always a smooth process. If you look at what happens over the course of a year or 18 months, it's more like a rollercoaster.
""The Australian dollar is actually a very volatile currency,"" Professor Holden says.
""In recent years ... we've seen the Australian dollar go from around 50 US cents to around $US1.10 and a whole bunch in between — in a very jiggedy-jaggedy way.""
There are other factors at play as well — like the fortunes of Asian economies.
Rollins says many investors see the Australian dollar as a ""proxy for exposure to the emerging Asian markets"".
""Partly this is because it's such a heavily traded currency ... it's a reasonably safe and liquid way to expose yourself to what's going on in the emerging Asian markets,"" he says.
""It's seen as quite a valuable trade to make to try and ride the tiger of Asia without being full-blooded exposed to it.""
You may also have heard the dollar referred to as a ""commodity currency"" — that's because its value also moves with the prices of commodities like gold, oil and natural gas.
""In simple terms if the iron ore prices and other commodity prices go up, the Australian dollar will go up. And if oil prices and other commodity prices go down, then the Australian dollar will follow, and that makes it special,"" Professor Bauer says.
Make money money: Lessons from a forex trader
Within the dollar's gyrations is the chance for forex traders, who buy a currency at one price and sell it at a better one, to make some very big bucks.
""They're living in a kind of micro world where upticks and down-ticks of tenths of a percentage point make a big difference,"" Professor Holden says.
Andrew Taylor is a forex trader and the chief executive of Royal Financial Trading in Sydney. When he's determining the value of the dollar, he divides all the factors into three categories: macro, micro and monetary policy.
The macro, he says, is all about ""big political events occurring over long periods of time"".
He lists things like Brexit, trade wars, tensions over North Korea's nuclear capacity, and any number of actions by Mr Trump — a ""walking geopolitical event in himself"".
Part of what goes into the macro bucket is something called risk appetite: more-or-less how the market is feeling about the future.
If the economy is looking pretty rosy, it's ""risk on"".
""The investment capital starts to flow in and chase that optimism,"" Mr Taylor says.
""They tend to be higher yielding types of assets — things like the Australian dollar, commodities, equities.""
On the flip side is ""risk off"", where there's more negativity and uncertainty in the market. In that environment, investors are likely to seek low-risk assets — safe havens such as the Yen and US Treasuries.
Micro factors are the weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly data releases. There's a bunch of them, and part of the challenge for traders is to work out which ones are important.
Mr Taylor looks at the data on labour markets, inflation, manufacturing and services, and sentiment. They all give him insight into how the economy is going.
""For example … if you've got optimism around jobs and growth, people will feel ... comfortable to go out and borrow and spend, and that helps with the growth picture.""
And that leads us to monetary policy — aka interest rates.
Mr Taylor calls this ""the biggest element within the puzzle"". He pays close attention to the brief, measured statements the Reserve Bank issues with each rates decision.
""They choose their words carefully. I look at ... the rhetoric behind what they're saying, what they're looking at, any factors that they're looking at in future,"" he says.
Can a low dollar be a good thing?
If you've travelled overseas, you've probably felt the pain of a bad exchange rate (or been lucky enough to benefit from a good one).
And it impacts on businesses too, affecting different industries in different ways.
A low dollar can be a good thing for exporters, and the local tourism industry.
""Why is that? Well it makes our stuff relatively cheaper for people overseas to buy... and that's good for our exporters,"" Professor Holden says.
""An Australian dollar at 50 cents makes it really easy and cheap for US tourists to eat at expensive restaurants, or travel around Australia, and stay in hotels and all that kind of stuff.""
On the other side of the coin, a low dollar spells bad news for the many businesses and households who purchase goods and services in US dollars.
""A low Australian dollar is damaging because it makes the stuff that we buy to run our businesses more expensive,"" Professor Holden explains.
""[If] your local coffee shop takes your order on an iPad, it's buying that in US dollars. The software that runs on that, the point of sale software, is typically made overseas and denominated in US dollars.
""When the Australian dollar falls ... businesses invest less.""
Where are we now — and what next?
As Rollins notes, there's never just one factor determining the value of the dollar.
""It's a dynamic environment,"" he says.
""You can't just tick off the checklist and say it's interest rate differential all the time, it's credit rating all the time, it's the Australian dollar's a hedge all the time.
""The importance of these factors waxes and wanes as the environment shifts.
""In the forthcoming period you'd expect that those global factors and uncertainties ... would loom very large in how the Australian dollar plays out from now on.""
Those uncertainties, he says, are things like the prospect of a hugely damaging trade war between the US and China, and anxiety over the political climate in Germany.
""And then you've got the running sore of Brexit in the background — and even North Korea could rear its head again,"" Rollins adds.
For all the long-term importance of interest rate differentials, 25 years of economic growth and a triple-A rating, that seems to be where we are: the things we can't control — things that happen outside of Australia — are likely to have the biggest impact on our dollar.
""Probably the US dollar is going to play continue to play its role as a safe haven, which you'd expect would put downward pressure on the Australian dollar,"" Rollins says.

A 2007 Australia Institute study identified 17 suitable sites for nuclear power plants including six in Queensland – Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, the Sunshine Coast and Bribie Island.
THE Turnbull Government will be urged to consider developing a nuclear power industry under a plan to be debated at the LNP convention.
The controversial resolution, proposed by Fairfax MP Ted O'Brien's branch, could lead to a plan for generators across the country if it is adopted by the party and then acted on by the government.
The branch does not list possible sites for nuclear power plants in the resolution but urges the Federal Government to ""consider the feasibility of nuclear powered energy generation in Australia"".

A 2007 study by the left wing Australia Institute identified 17 suitable sites for nuclear power plants including six in Queensland - Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, the Sunshine Coast and Bribie Island.
That study chose locations using key criteria including existing electricity infrastructure, centres of demand, transport infrastructure and access to large quantities of water for cooling and warned setting up a nuclear industry in Australia could prove unpopular.
""If the Federal Government decided to promote the establishment of a nuclear power industry in Australia, the siting of the power plants is likely to be one of the most politically contentious issues,"" the report said.
""In Australia, approximately half of the population opposes nuclear energy and two thirds say they would oppose a nuclear power plant in their local area.""
The Fairfax LNP branch has proposed three separate resolutions on energy policy to be debated at the convention, which starts in Brisbane on Friday.
Other resolutions from the branch call on the government to ""reduce the high level of subsidy paid to the renewable energy industry"" and ""support the building of new Coal Fired Power Stations that have the capacity to produce reliable and economic power"".
Resolutions that are adopted by the LNP convention are not binding on the government. Mr O'Brien could not be reached for comment.",www.dailyexaminer.com.au,2018-07-05 06:00:19,14,692439

BEFORE THE WORST: 500-game NBA forward Andray Blatche (headband) is restrained as he tries to charge at Boomers representative Daniel Kickert (right).
BASKETBALL: As the basketball world comes to grips with the sickening events of Monday night, long-time Boomer Danny Morseu gave his take on the fierce altercation that had the world talking.
The Toowoomba Mountaineers coach is familiar with playing in the basketball-mad country of the Philippines, having represented Australia at the 1978 World Championships in Manilla.
Morseu said security was high as a result of the tragedies of the 1972 Munich Olympics, but remembers the passion of the fans in attendance.
""I remember this vividly, going to Manila for the World Championships, we were escorted from the airport to the motel by very high security with the police and the military,” he said.
""Going for training sessions and games, we would have a couple of police cars and military personnel at the front and back of the bus.
""I can recall walking in, and around the courts was very high security.
""The Filipino community love their basketball and it's a national sport.
""The community itself and the players are very passionate about basketball.”
Monday night's fixture featured one of the worst brawls seen on a basketball court, as Filipino players and officials attacked Boomers players.
This tournament marks Australia's first involvement in World Cup qualification in Asia, and Morseu believes this has led to a change in how teams approach games.
""I was somewhat disappointed but not surprised by the Filipino team,” he said.
""The types of game now you'll find from the opposition teams who want to qualify are going to be quite aggressive.
""I think that was the case in the Philippines. Some of the boys got fed up with being pushed around and knocked down.”
With the Philippines down by 31 on their home court, Morseu said it was a disappointing outcome.
""I think it was the wrong stand and certainly wasn't great for the game of basketball,” he said.
""It's quite disappointing to see what has actually happened where the whole of the Philippines bench came off and had a go at five of the players on the court.
""I felt embarrassed for the people to get involved in that sort of crazy behaviour, it was uncalled for.
""Especially when there was nine of them onto two or three players on the floor. It was just ridiculous.
""At the end of the day our players were more disciplined and more focused on getting the outcomes they wanted.
""It's going to be a call now for FIBA to do something about it. Obviously there is going to be some action taken against the Filipino players and those that participated in the incident.”",www.thechronicle.com.au,2018-07-05 06:00:00,23,384891

THERE TO HELP: TRL referee Ian McGill offers a helping hand to Oakey ballboy Jett Stanton at Trevor Mickleborough Oval. Simone Stanton
RUGBY LEAGUE: A simple act of goodwill has sparked an outpouring of emotion on social media among the Toowoomba Rugby League community.
While performing ballboy duties for the Oakey Bears second division side, five-year-old Jett Stanton encountered a problem when his shoelace became untied.
That was until referee Ian McGill offered a helping hand to the young boy.
The moment was snapped by his mother Simone, with the image capturing imaginations on the TRL Facebook page.
The encapsulating photo has currently received more than 350 likes and over 20 shares, and Simone said it was heart warming to witness the act of simple goodwill.
""It's something that you don't see every day. It was good to see the referee taking time out to help a little boy,” she said.
""It's good to see the little ones get appreciated. They help the big boys and it's nice for them to take the time to notice them.”
McGill was notified by his daughter of the photo making headway on Facebook, and didn't expect the gesture to go viral.
""It was during a goal kick and the young ballboy brought the tee out,” McGill said.
""I noticed it was undone. He was down there and I saw him struggling, so I bent down and did it.
""Later on in the first half the other one came loose so I did that one for him as well.
""It's one of those small gestures you do. You'd hope other referees would do the same if they saw an incident to stop and help the young fellas.

BEST IN OZ: Evalyn Parsons's wedding hair styling business was named the best in Australia.
A HUMBLE wedding business operating out of Moffat Beach has been named the 'best in the biz' for the second year running
Evalyn Parsons has been snipping brides into style for over 20 years and her business, also named Evalyn Parsons, was just announced as the country's number one Wedding Stylist of the Year at the Australian Bridal Institute Awards.
The awards were decided based on real-life customer feedback gathered over four years.
Mrs Parsons said it was her customer-driven business model that ensured her clients were completely satisfied.
""I've never had a bride that hasn't been happy with her hair at the end,” she said.
""It's about being willing to walk with them and sometimes it's about putting in those extra hours or re-doing things.”
To ensure this incentive is delivered, Mrs Parsons employed a dedicated bride liaison manager, who handles customer service right from the very first email.
""It enables our team of stylists to focus completely on the creative side of hair styling and really be part of the bride's day in that way,” she said.
Tailoring brides to the latest trends was not a difficult feat for Mrs Parsons, who admitted keeping a close eye on the fashions of both America and Europe.
""I am very active online and on Instagram, researching the latest trends,” she said.
""Lately we've seen a lot of down waves but, with the recent royal wedding, I am expecting to start seeing a large push to simple glamour.
""I think we will see a little more up-styling again to achieve that classic bride look.”
For the passionate stylist, the real reward didn't come in the form of a trophy, it came from the sincere satisfaction of her clients.
""It's not just about getting a hairstyle on someone,” she said.
""It's about delivering a service that makes someone go 'wow I feel the best I've ever felt'.”",www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au,2018-07-05 06:00:00,14,427880
"A Japanese high court ruled Wednesday that two nuclear reactors at a central Japan plant should not suspend operations, overturning a lower court ruling in favor of local residents who claim the plant is vulnerable to major earthquakes and other disasters.
The Kanazawa Branch of the Nagoya High Court ruled that the Nos. 3 and 4 reactors of Kansai Electric Power Co's Oi plant do not threaten the personal rights of those living nearby and the utility has not underestimated the size of a potential earthquake occurring in the area.
""It is the worst possible court ruling we can think of,"" said Hiroyuki Kawai, a lawyer who supports the local residents.
The Fukui District Court ruled in May 2014 against their restart in the first such ruling over Japanese nuclear power plants since the Fukushima nuclear crisis in March 2011. It is the first high court ruling given among a slew of lawsuits filed by people seeking suspension of nuclear reactors nationwide.
""Although it is possible to scrap nuclear power generation itself in light of the Fukushima nuclear plant accident, making such a decision is beyond the role of the judiciary, and it therefore should be left for politics to decide,"" said Presiding Justice Masayuki Naito.
The pressurized water reactors in question already resumed operation in March and May, respectively, after clearing in May last year new safety standards introduced in the wake of the meltdowns at Fukushima Daiichi power plant triggered by a major earthquake and ensuing tsunami.
The reactors had been idle since going offline in September 2013 for regular safety inspections. Their operations were previously halted in March and July of 2011, respectively, for inspection and restarted in July 2012 after clearing provisional safety standards.
During a high court hearing, Kunihiko Shimazaki, a former member of the Nuclear Regulation Authority who was in charge of the screening of the two reactors, testified the utility could be underestimating the size of a potential earthquake it assumes for designing its reactors' quake resistance.
Kansai Electric argued it has made its calculations by assuming longer and wider faults exist around the premises.
The district court ruled it will not allow the restart of the two reactors, citing flaws in the utility's measures against earthquakes and allowing suspension if there are specific risks to people's most fundamental right to protect their lives.
While plaintiffs said the district court ruling was appropriate as it took into account the Fukushima accident and damage it caused, the utility said the ruling was based on abstract risks and the court needs to base its decision on scientific expertise.
Of the plaintiffs, the court only accepted the claims by 166 and rejected 23 who were outside the 250-kilometer area from the power plant. Both the utility and the rejected plaintiffs appealed the ruling.

"NEW YORK (AP) — Yankees second baseman Gleyber Torres was placed on the 10-day disabled list on Wednesday because of a strained right hip.
Torres was removed after striking out in his second at-bat in the fourth inning before the Yankees went on to beat the Atlanta Braves 6-2.
Before the series finale against the National League East leaders, Yankees manager Aaron Boone was upbeat about the status of his prized rookie.
Torres did not start in Tuesday night's win, but entered the game late as a defensive replacement.
""We're hoping it's a short stint. But we think we've got to deal with it this time because there is a small strain there,"" Boone said outside the home clubhouse after the game.
""Hopefully it won't be something that it's too long. Probably take us up to the All-Star break.""
Boone said the club would assess the situation with a day off Thursday before heading to Toronto for the start of an 11-game, three-city road trip leading into the All-Star Game in Washington.
Torres is hitting .294 with 15 home runs and 42 RBIs in his first 63 major league games.
He had an MRI and was not available to talk to reporters after the game.
Neil Walker, who went over from third base to second at the start of the fifth inning, could get most of the work in Torres' absence.
Another option could be Ronald Torreyes, but he's been on the temporary inactive list at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre for more than a week to deal with a personal issue. Brandon Drury, who started 114 games at second for Arizona last season, could also figure into the mix.
Boone wasn't sure how the injury initially occurred, pointing out that Torres had made some ""good base running plays a couple of nights ago when he moved up on some wild pitches.""
The Yankees manager also added that if the injury had occurred late in the season, it would've been ""possible"" for the phenom to be back on the field shortly.
But the team with the second-best record in baseball took the safe route.
""Anytime you're talking about groin, hamstring, quads, once you have a strain in there, you push through it you can make it a worse strain,"" Boone said.
""And now you're talking weeks and months. Stuff like that. So I think the wise thing is to do this now. Gleyber wants to take a couple of days, work through it. But I think he also understands this is the best thing for him and for us.""

"An image taken from a July 2014 propaganda video allegedly shows Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group, adressing worshippers at a mosque in the Iraqi city of Mosul at a time that the militants controlled the city
By -
Russian forces killed the son of Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a missile attack on a Syrian cave in which he was hiding, Iraqi intelligence said Wednesday.
IS's propaganda outlet Amaq said Hudhayfah al-Badri was killed in an ""operation against the Nussayriyyah and the Russians at the thermal power station in Homs"", in a statement published Tuesday alongside a photo of a young man holding an assault rifle.
Nussayriyyah is the term used by IS for the Alawite religious minority sect of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Iraq's Falcon's intelligence cell said Russian forces on Monday fired three missiles at a cave in Homs that held 30 ""terrorist leaders"" and several of Badri's bodyguards.
It said 11 people were killed in the attack.
""Badri wasn't even a fighter... he was an icon that was moved from one place to another as a form of psychological propoganda for the rest of the organisation,"" the Falcons said on Wednesday.
The Iraqi government declared victory over IS in December, but the military has continued regular operations targeting mostly desert areas along the porous Syrian border.
The group's leader Baghdadi, who has been pronounced dead on several occasions, remains alive in Syrian territory by the Iraqi border, an Iraqi intelligence official said in May.
Originally from Iraq, Baghdadi has been dubbed the ""most wanted man on the planet"" and the United States is offering a $25 million reward for his capture.
On June 22, Badri escaped an Iraqi air force raid that killed two of his bodyguards, including Saud Mohammed al-Kurdi, also known as Abu Abdallah, who was married to Baghdadi's daughter Duaa.
IS declared a cross-border ""caliphate"" in Syria and Iraq in 2014, seizing a third of Iraq during a sweeping offensive.
While the jihadists have lost much of the territory they once controlled, IS still controls pockets in Syria's central desert province of Homs, and areas along the border between Syria and Iraq.

Roger Federer extended his flawless winning streak at Wimbledon to 26 consecutive sets as the defending champion crushed Lukas Lacko, while Venus Williams battled back to beat Alexandra Dulgheru in Wednesday's second round action.
Federer delivered a Centre Court masterclass lasting 89 minutes as the Swiss star hit 48 winners and 16 aces in his 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 victory. The 36-year-old is now on his joint second longest streak of sets won at Wimbledon -- his best was 34 between the third round in 2005 to the 2006 final.
Next up for Federer is a third round tie against 39-year-old Croatian Ivo Karlovic or German world number 64 Jan-Lennard Struff.
In his 20th Wimbledon appearance, top seed Federer, a 20-time major winner, is bidding to become only the second player to claim nine singles titles at the All England Club after Martina Navratilova.
On the evidence of his ruthless demolition of Slovakian world number 73 Lacko, it will take something special to stop Federer making more Wimbledon history.
""I played very well. I felt good out there, less nerves than in the first round,"" Federer said. ""I'm happy how I am hitting the ball, good concentration on my service games and able to mix it up with some slices. Of course, you sometimes play the percentages, but if you do that too much it becomes boring, so I like to mix it up. I clearly enjoy the path more where it comes easier, not wasting too much energy is always nice.""
Milos Raonic slammed 34 aces as the 2016 Wimbledon finalist won 7-6 (7/4, 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/4) against Australia's John Millman. The Canadian 13th seed will play Austrian qualifier Dennis Novak, who beat French 17th seed Lucas Pouille 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (8/10), 3-6, 6-2.
Sam Querrey, the 11th seed, stepped up his bid to emulate last year's run to the semifinals with a 7-6 (7/4), 6-3, 6-3 win against Ukraine's Sergiy Stakhovsky.
Querrey's fellow American Madison Keys, seeded 10th, celebrated U.S. Independence Day with a 6-4, 6-3 win against Thailand's Luksika Kumkhum.
Five-time champion Venus Williams battled into the third round with a 4-6, 6-0, 6-1 win over Romanian qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru. Venus reached her ninth Wimbledon final last year, but the American star was denied a sixth title by Garbine Muguruza.
She returned to the All England Club stuck in a rut after losing in the first round of both the Australian and French Opens this year. Making her 21st Wimbledon appearance, 38-year-old Venus is the oldest woman in this year's tournament.
But she didn't look her age in making it 89 career match wins at Wimbledon by demolishing Dulgheru in the final two sets. Asked if her wealth of Wimbledon experience was a key factor, Venus said: ""I'd love to have that extra advantage. If that's working for me I'm all for it. It's just about winning the match. If that's your best or not doesn't matter.""
Venus next faces Dutch 20th seed Kiki Bertens, who beat Russian world number 107 Anna Blinkova 6-4, 6-0.
Croatian world number 55 Donna Vekic followed up her shock success against fourth seed Sloane Stephens with a 7-5, 6-4 victory against Sweden's Rebecca Peterson. Romanian 29th seed Mihaela Buzarnescu thrashed British teenager Katie Swan, 6-0, 6-3 to extend her remarkable renaissance. A year ago, Buzarnescu was ranked 213 and lost in Wimbledon qualifying -- yet now she will face Czech seventh seed Karolina Pliskova for a place in the last 16.
Former world number one Pliskova has finally made it to the third round on her seventh visit to Wimbledon after seeing off two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka 6-3, 6-3. Former Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwanska lost 7-5, 6-4 to Czech world number 66 Lucie Safarova.
Serena Williams powered to her 16th successive win at Wimbledon as the seven-time champion routed Bulgarian qualifier Viktoriya Tomova 6-1, 6-4. Williams was in dominant mood on Centre Court, brushing aside Tomova in just 66 minutes with 24 winners and four aces to extend her streak of consecutive match wins at the All England Club.
Caroline Wozniacki suffered fresh Wimbledon woe as the world number two suffered a shock 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 defeat against Ekaterina Makarova in the second round, before telling the Russian: ""You won't go far.""
Wozniacki, plagued by an invasion of flying ants during the Court One clash, saved five match points but has now failed to get past the last 16 in 12 visits to the All England Club.
It was a bitter defeat for the 27-year-old Dane, who was expected to challenge for the Wimbledon title after winning her maiden Grand Slam crown at the Australian Open in January.
Wozniacki then told Makarova not to get too optimistic about making a deep run at the All England Club despite the Russian winning the women's doubles title in 2017.
""I think she played above her level and really raised it and got a little lucky and played well when she needed to,"" sniffed Wozniacki who had lost to the 30-year-old in the second round of the U.S. Open last year.

"LONDON (AP) — Austrian qualifier Dennis Novak is through to the third round at Wimbledon, with a little help from the Thiem family.
The 171st-ranked Novak defeated 17th-seeded Lucas Pouille 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (8), 3-6, 6-2 on Wednesday to double his Grand Slam win tally.
Novak, in the main draw at the All England Club for the first time, trains alongside French Open runner-up Dominic Thiem and is coached by his countryman's father, Wolfgang.
""We speak a lot and I think he's played almost against everyone already,"" Novak said of Dominic, who quit his first-round match at Wimbledon with a back injury. ""So I ask him for advice if he can tell me something about the players.""
The tips on Pouille appeared accurate as Novak raced into a two-set lead in less than an hour.
However, after saving two match points in the third set tiebreaker, the Frenchman found his rhythm, hitting 15 winners in the fourth set to level.
Novak's self-belief was brought under further scrutiny when he allowed Pouille to cancel out an early break at the beginning of the fifth set, but the Austrian rallied to win four games in a row and seal victory in just short of three hours.
In the back of his mind were the words of encouragement he has received from seventh-ranked Thiem.
""He just tells me he knows how good I can play, and he really believes in me, and that's what makes me feel really good and comfortable,"" Novak said.
Novak, who made his Grand Slam debut in a first round defeat to Grigor Dimitrov at the Australian Open earlier this season, is playing the fourth grass-court tournament of his career.
His ranking prevented him from entering second-tier, let alone ATP, warmup events for Wimbledon, but having come through three rounds of qualifying in London, Novak is taking a liking to the surface.
""I don't know if I'm a specialist but I think my game is OK for grass,"" Novak said. ""I return good, I have a flat backhand and I serve good.""
His next challenge is a matchup with 2016 runner-up Milos Raonic, who at 147mph (236kph), delivered the second fastest serve in Wimbledon history as he advanced in straight sets against John Millman.
""I know he's around Dominic Thiem quite a bit, I think they train together,"" Raonic said. ""I know I haven't seen him play... I have 48 hours to learn as much as I can.""
Raonic's best preparation might be recalling what Thiem's tactics were last time he faced him.

"Joey ""Jaws"" Chestnut has extended his reign as champion eater at the Nathan's Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest, downing a record 74 sausages and buns in 10 minutes to take home the coveted Mustard Belt for an 11th time.
Miki Sudo held on to her title as the top women's competitor at the annual Brooklyn eat-off, chomping 37 franks and buns to take home the top prize for an unprecedented fifth consecutive year.
""I found a vicious rhythm,"" the 34-year-old Chestnut said after the stuffing session on Wednesday. ""I was feeling good today.""
But while Chestnut ate 10 more dogs and buns than second-place finisher Carmen Cincotti, a judging error cast initial doubt over their totals after jurists didn't see the eaters were taking the dogs and buns from two plates.
Eric Gonzalez, the Brooklyn district attorney, certified the final tally and Chestnut's record of 74, two more than he consumed last year.
""At the end of the day, Joey Chestnut came in here and ate 74 hot dogs, broke a world record,"" said Cincotti, who celebrated his 26th birthday on Wednesday. ""Apparently they were good dogs.""
A total of $US40,000 ($A54,000) in prize money was up for grabs, with the first-place winners taking home $US10,000 each.
Sudo fell short of the 41 hot dogs she consumed last year, but easily beat out second-place finisher Mischelle Lesco of Tuscon, Arizona, who chowed down 28 wieners and buns.
Thousands of attendees, many donning mustard-coloured hot dog caps, braved the temperatures to witness the annual July Fourth competition on the Coney Island boardwalk.

"The Thai official overseeing the rescue of a football team trapped in a flooded cave has said the boys and their coach may leave in stages.
Chiang Rai provincial governor Narongsak Osatanakorn said that ""all 13 may not come out at the same time"".
He added: ""If the condition is right and if that person is ready 100 per cent, he can come out.""
He said authorities will evaluate their readiness each day and if there is any risk, will not proceed.
Earlier, the Thai football teammates said they are healthy in a newly released video.
The 12 boys and their coach are seen sitting with Thai navy Seals in the dark cave with their visibly skinny faces illuminated by the beam of a flashlight.
The boys, many wrapped in space blankets, take turns introducing themselves, folding their hands together in a traditional greeting and saying their names and that they are healthy.
The video lasting about a minute was recorded some time on Tuesday and was posted on the navy Seal Facebook page on Wednesday morning.
The boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach disappeared after they went exploring in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in northern Chiang Rai province after a football game on June 23.
The teammates, who were trapped inside when heavy rains flooded the cave, were found by rescue divers late on Monday night during a desperate search that drew assistance from experts around the globe, including Australia, and British divers Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who were the first rescuers to reach the group.
Authorities said the boys, who had also been shown on Tuesday in a video shot by the British divers, were being looked after by seven members of the Thai navy Seals, including medics, who were staying with them inside the cave.
They were mostly in stable condition and have received high-protein drinks.
In both of the videos the boys appeared in good spirits.
Seal commander Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yookongkaew said there was no rush to bring the group out of the cave, since they are safe where they are.
The current flooding situation means the boys would have to dive, which rescue experts have said could be extremely dangerous.

GUATEMALA CITY: One month after Guatemala's Fuego volcano violently erupted, killing more than 100 people, the country's disaster agency has raised the number of missing by more than two thirds to 332 people.
Authorities scoured records from hospitals, shelters, schools and an online registry as well as Guatemala's utility company and health ministry to update the tally, disaster agency CONRED said in a statement on Wednesday.

It previously said 197 people had gone missing since the eruptions of dust, ash and super-heated gas known as pyroclastic flows that began on June 3 at the Fuego volcano, its strongest activity in four decades.
At least 113 people died, CONRED said on Wednesday, and some in the hardest-hit areas lost nearly all their family members.
The 3,763-metre (12,346-feet) peak, whose name means fire in Spanish, is one of several active volcanoes among the 34 located in Guatemala.
The volcano sits about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of the capital, Guatemala City, near the picturesque colonial town of Antigua, a UNESCO world heritage site.

"Bengaluru
THE Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) said on Wednesday it plans to make banks issuing credit cards set credit limits at no higher than what the customer can afford to repay in three years, after a review found many consumers were ensnared in credit card debt.
Asic said it found that 18.5 per cent of consumers were struggling with credit card debt, adding that credit cards present a debt trap for more than one in six consumers.
The three-year repayment period proposal is to strike a balance between ensuring consumers have access to credit cards and preventing them from being unable to repay debt.
sentifi.com Market voices on:
""Our findings confirm the risk that credit cards can cause financial difficulty for many Australian consumers,"" said Asic deputy chair Peter Kell. Asic also estimates that almost 525,000 consumers have paid more interest as a result of Citi, Latitude, American Express and Macquarie retaining old rules for credit cards taken out before June 2012.

"A LACK of understanding of indigenous culture has led to banks blocking some of their customers from their money, with a Cape York woman forced to fly nearly 800km for a replacement ATM card.
Identification issues among bank customers in remote and rural communities has emerged as a key problem within the nation's banking system, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has told a public hearing in Darwin.
The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry heard on Tuesday from ASIC senior policy analyst Nathan Boyle, who said Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were being excluded from basic financial products, partly due to a lack of being able to meet basic identification criteria.
Mr Boyle said it could be quite difficult for indigenous Australians to verify their identities over the phone.
""Sometimes we see financial services have policies about the types of questions that are asked and they can only ask questions in a certain way which might not make any sense to an Aboriginal person in a remote community,"" he said.
""One that we come across quite regularly is … they will be asked, 'what is your street address? And in a lot of remote communities, there aren't street names and the person will say 'I don't have a street address'.""

""(She) had lost her bank card, had failed the identification processes, and was then told to travel to Cairns to visit her local branch,"" he said.
""And it was during the wet season, so the only way that she could get to Cairns was to fly, which was quite expensive, and she was quite distressed when she contacted us.""
The hearing was also informed that poor financial literacy had led to indigenous people being routinely ripped off by unconscionable lenders, such as Channic Pty Ltd and Cash Brokers Pty Ltd.

"Defending champ Joey 'Jaws' Chestnut sets record with 74 hot dogs in annual US eating contest
Posted
Joey ""Jaws"" Chestnut extended his reign as champion eater at the Nathan's Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest, downing a world-record 74 wieners and buns in 10 minutes to take home the coveted Mustard Belt for an 11th time.
Miki Sudo held onto her title as the top women's competitor at the annual Brooklyn eat-off, chomping 37 franks and buns to take home the top prize for an unprecedented fifth consecutive year.
""I found a vicious rhythm,"" the 34-year-old Chestnut said after the stuffing session.
""I was feeling good today.""
But while Chestnut ate 10 more dogs and buns than second-place finisher Carmen Cincotti, a judging error cast initial doubt over their totals after jurists didn't see the eaters were taking the dogs and buns from two plates.
""Frankly, the judging was just off,"" George Shea, the longtime Coney Island announcer, said.
""Joey said, 'look at my plates' and Carmen said 'look at my plates.' We counted the plates that they had eaten and it was 64 and 74.""
Eric Gonzalez, the Brooklyn district attorney, certified the final tally and Chestnut's record of 74, two more than he consumed last year.
""At the end of the day, Joey Chestnut came in here and ate 74 hot dogs, broke a world record,"" said Cincotti, who celebrated his 26th birthday on Wednesday.
""Apparently they were good dogs.""
A total of $40,000 in prize money was up for grabs, with the first-place winners taking home $10,000 each.
Sudo fell short of the 41 hot dogs she consumed last year, but easily beat out second-place finisher Mischelle Lesco of Tucson, Arizona, who chowed down 28 wieners and buns.
Thousands of attendees, many donning mustard-colored hot dog caps, braved 28-degree temperatures and a heat index of 33 degrees to witness the annual July Fourth competition on the Coney Island boardwalk.
The outlandish tradition dates to 1972, though the company has long promoted what a former president acknowledged was a legendary start date of 1916.
Fan Martha Pleasant, 41, of Franklin, New Jersey, said she was attending the competitive eating competition to support her husband Dwight, who ""loves wieners"".
""We are trying to knock something off my hubby's bucket list,"" she said.

"Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Wednesday he expects to see the first results of the company's new majority stake in Bombardier's CSeries jetliner program within weeks, around the time of the Farnborough Air Show later this month.
MONTREAL: Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Wednesday he expects to see the first results of the company's new majority stake in Bombardier's CSeries jetliner program within weeks, around the time of the Farnborough Air Show later this month.
""I'm convinced we'll see first results already in the next couple of weeks,"" Enders told employees at a CSeries plane factory near Montreal.

Asked later about CSeries orders, Enders told reporters there might be something to see in time for the industry's flagship event, the Farnborough Air Show, which begins on July 16.
He did not elaborate on whether this meant new firm orders for the 110- to 130-seat planes.
Airbus SE took a majority stake in Bombardier Inc's CSeries after completing a tie-up with the Canadian train and plane maker on Sunday.
Bombardier agreed in 2017 to sell Airbus a 50.01 percent stake in its key commercial jet for a token fee of one Canadian dollar, after sluggish sales, high costs and low production rates pushed the plane program well over budget.

Enders repeated comments from 2017 that he expects to sell ""thousands"" of CSeries aircraft, although neither he nor plane program head Philippe Balducchi would give specific figures for new orders in 2018.
Balducchi told employees the European planemaker would have to ""drastically cut costs,"" reiterating the company's plan to bring down the cost structure of CSeries production.
While Airbus is expected to put pressure on CSeries suppliers to lower costs, Enders did not give specifics on whether there could be employee cutbacks.
""We're at the start of this partnership,"" he said.

Enders also told reporters he is worried that an escalation in a U.S. trade dispute with other countries could trigger retaliation that could impact air traffic. ""Of course we're worried if this escalates,"" Enders said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs of 25 percent for steel and 10 percent for aluminum from Europe, Canada and other countries, sparking retaliation.
The World Trade Organization said in a report on Wednesday that trade barriers being erected by major economies could jeopardize the global economic recovery and their effects are already starting to show. Enders, however, added that he was “very encouraged to see that more and more American companies are speaking up against the trade policy of the White House. I believe that will have an impact.""

"MORE than 30 eye witnesses could be called in the case against a Murwillumbah man accused of the stabbing murder of a father of four in broad daylight last year.
Charlie Larter tragically lost his life on his 46th birthday after intervening in a brawl in Knox Park, Murwillumbah, between noon and 2pm on June 6 last year.
James Paul Alderton, now 23, was subsequently charged with his murder.
Mr Alderton appeared in Lismore Local Court via video link on Tuesday, where he was represented by public defender Jason Watts.
The 23-year-old also stands accused of stabbing Mr Larter's son Zackary and another man, as well as the theft of a kitchen knife from a nearby Coles supermarket just prior to the alleged stabbings.
Mr Watts told the court he was seeking a further adjournment of the matter so the prosecution could consider some written submissions the defence provided late on Monday.
""I can indicate that Section 91 written submissions were given to the prosecution yesterday,"" Mr Watts said.
""I understand my friend needs some time to consider those.""
Mr Watts said the submissions included some 16 witness statements to the alleged events of June 6.
He also said the number of witnesses included in the defence submissions was ""less than half"" the total number of alleged eye witnesses to the events of the day.
Magistrate Annett Sinclair asked DPP prosecutor Alanna Coxon whether a two-week adjournment was sufficient for the prosecution to consider the submissions ahead of a possible committal hearing.
But Ms Coxon asked for an ""lengthier adjournment"" because of the large number of witnesses and the gravity of the offence.
Magistrate Sinclair agreed to adjourn the matter until August 7, to return to Lismore Local Court.

"An All Nippon Airways (ANA) Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner taxis in front of other aircraft at Haneda Airport in Tokyo.
Japanese airline ANA Holdings Inc said it will cancel 113 domestic flights between July 6 through July 12 to inspect Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc engines for compressor issues that have led to service interruptions for airlines globally.
The affected Rolls Royce Trent 1000 engines are used on ANA's Boeing Co 787 Dreamliner jets, the Japanese airline told reporters on Wednesday.
A compressor problem in the Trent 1000 package C engine has already led to planes being grounded by airlines such as British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Air New Zealand. In June, Rolls Royce said it had found the same issue on a ""small number of high life Package B engines.""
ANA has been conducting inspections on Trent 1000 package C engines under instruction from Japan's transport ministry, with an expansion of inspections to include package B engines leading to the flight cancellations, the airline said.
In total 136 engines are affected, said ANA, the world's biggest 787 operator by fleet size.
Progress on a fix for the affected engines has been hampered by a global shortage of replacement parts, the airline said.

"Delhi cannot be accorded the status of a state. Status of Delhi L-G is not that of a governor of a state.
New Delhi: In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court on Wednesday held that the lieutenant governor (L-G) of NCT of Delhi has no absolute or over-riding powers and he is bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. At the same time, the court upheld the L-G’s exclusive executive power over matters related to the Union Territories’ land, police, law and order and said that Delhi cannot be accorded the status of a state.
A five-judge Constitution Bench headed by the Chief Justice Dipak Misra, in a 535-page ruling, said, “The lieutenant governor has not been entrusted with any independent decision-making power. He has to either act on the ‘aid and advice’ of Council of Ministers or he is bound to implement the decision taken by the President on a reference being made by him.”
The Supreme Court, however, held that Delhi is a Union Territory with special status and cannot be construed as a state as a nine-judge Bench of the apex court has already made the position clear. This, in a way, ruled out any possibility of chief minister Kejriwal’s demand for full statehood being fulfilled.
The CJI said the elected representatives and the Council of Ministers of Delhi, being accountable to the voters of Delhi, must have the appropriate powers so as to perform their functions effectively and efficiently.
The CJI said a representative form of government should not become a government by elites where the representatives so elected do nothing to give effect to the will of the sovereign.
The verdict came on a batch of petitions filed by the Kejriwal government challenging the alleged obstructions caused by L-G Anil Baijal, who reports to the Union government, in the day-to-day administration.
CJI Misra for himself and Justices A.K. Sikri said, “It is clear as noon day that by no stretch of imagination, NCT of Delhi can be accorded the status of a State under our present constitutional scheme.
“The status of NCT of Delhi is sui generis, a class apart, and the status of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is not that of a governor of a state, rather he remains an administrator, in a limited sense, working with the designation of L-G,” the verdict said.
Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Ashok Bhushan gave different but concurrent judgments with additional reasons.
“The L-G must bear in mind that it is not he, but the council of ministers which takes substantive decisions and even when he invokes the proviso, the L-G has to abide by the decision of the President,” said Justice Chandrachud.
It held that though the L-G was not a “titular head”, he should not emerge as an “adversary having a hostile attitude” towards the Council of Ministers but rather act as a facilitator.
The differences of opinion between the LG and the Council of Ministers should have a “sound rationale” and there should be no exposition of the “phenomenon of an obstructionist”.
The Constitution Bench had heard arguments on a batch of special leave petitions filed by the Delhi government against a judgment of the Delhi high court, which held that the L-G was the administrative head of the Capital and was not bound by the aid and advice of the chief minister or Council of Ministers. The high court had held that the then LG, Najeeb Jung was its administrative head and all decisions will have to be taken with his consent and concurrence.
The Kejriwal government had complained that the L-G is acting as a stumbling block in every decisions as his approval is required for implementation.
The bench said the terminology used in Articles 239AA of the Constitution and the rules make it clear that the decisions of the Council of Ministers must be communicated to the L-G but this does not mean that his concurrence is required.
The CJI held that the control of the Centre is confined to three areas — land, police and public order — and there cannot be any attempt on the part of the Union government to seize all control.
“The Centre must allow the concepts of pragmatic federalism and federal balance to prevail by giving the NCT of Delhi some degree of required independence in its functioning subject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution,” the court said.
The CJI said the LG should not “usurp the powers” and act in a mechanical manner without due application of mind so as to refer every decision of the Council of Ministers to the President.
The difference of opinion between the L-G and the Council of Ministers should have a sound rationale and there should not be exposition of the phenomenon of an obstructionist but reflection of the philosophy of affirmative constructionist and profound sagacity and judiciousness.
Mr Kejriwal called the apex court decision “a big victory for the people of Delhi...a big victory for democracy victory.”
Immediately after the court ruling, Mr Kejriwal chaired a meeting of all Cabinet ministers at his residence to discuss critical projects and mounted attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“If Modi govt had not withdrawn the powers of elected govt thro illegal orders, precious three years wud have been saved. People of Delhi are grateful to judiciary. Today’s order reinforces people’s faith in judiciary (sic),” Mr Kejriwal tweeted.
The Union government sought to downplay the Supreme Court verdict on Delhi’s statehood issue, saying the Constitutional Bench has only underlined the special status of Delhi as not being a “state” in the conventional sense.
A senior government functionary, who did not want to be quoted, also said the judgment has made it clear that Delhi cannot frame laws which are in contravention of laws being implemented by the Centre.",www.asianage.com,2018-07-05 05:40:00,32,236626

The chairman of South Korea's Asiana Airlines on Wednesday apologised after many of its planes took off without any in-flight meals this week because the carrier was suddenly forced to switch caterers.
Since Sunday, many Asiana flights have been delayed waiting for meals and many others, mostly short-haul flights to Japan and China, have had to leave without any.
""I am sorry for causing public concern over Asiana's in-flight meal crisis,"" said Park Sam-koo, chairman of Kumho Asiana Group whose main subsidiaries include Asiana Airlines and Kumho Enginering & Construction.
The debacle at South Korea's second largest airline is seen to have stemmed from a decision by Asiana this year to switch its in-flight meal provider, in a bid to help improve finances of its struggling parent group.
Asiana in March ended a 15-year-old deal with Lufthansa's LSG Sky Chefs after LGS refused Kumho Asiana Group's demand that LGS invest 160 billion won ($143 million) in the group's holding firm, which was in dire need of cash.
The airline then chose a new catering firm that was a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, which subsequently injected the needed funds.
But the new caterer suffered a fire at its plant, forcing Asiana to seek help from a smaller firm which was unable to meet the airline's daily needs.
The episode took a tragic twist on Monday when the owner of one of subcontractor suppliers committed suicide after complaining of pressure for him to take responsibility for the debacle.
Park also apologised for his death.
""I also feel very sorry about the tragedy involving the owner of one of our subcontractor suppliers and offer my deepest apology to his family,"" he said, bowing deeply in front of cameras in apology.
""My father and his colleagues worked more than 28 hours non-stop to prepare meals but the demand from contractors put too much pressure on them,"" the subcontractor's son told JTBC TV.
The suicide sparked nationwide fury as many accused the airline of trying to shift responsibility for its mismanagement to a powerless subcontractor.

A SINGLE father with two young daughters is pleading for help after failing to secure a rental property in Casino for more than a year.
Casino local Dwayne Townsend has been pro actively applying for rental properties for himself and daughters' Ebony, 9, and Niquetta, 10, through ""all of the real estate agencies in Casino,"" and believes the property owners are rejecting him because he is receiving a disability pension, parenting payments and is not working.
""I can't work,"" he said.
""I broke my leg badly in an accident and suffer from severe osteo arthritis and gout ... I'm pretty much buggered.
""I've been trying for so long, I just wish someone would give us a chance.""
Dwayne Townsend and daughters Ebony, 9, and Niquetta, 10 are pleading for help after failing to secure a rental property in the Casino area for more than a year. Marc Stapelberg
Mr Townsend said he had previously rented a property through PRD Nationwide Casino for five and a half years and had good rental references, but at times, agents would tell him he did not meet the application criteria.
""It's because of the rental shortage in this town"" he said.
""It's also because rent is that dear here, but with my payments combined I can afford the rent.
""But it's also because I'm a single dad on disability...I get so down and depressed about it and just think I'm worthless.""
Mr Townsend and his daughters have been staying with his mother's partner in Casino while he looks for accommodation.
""We can't stay here much longer, we've been here long enough and mum's not real well,"" he said.
""I don't know what we'll do when we do have to leave.""
Mr Townsend said he had explored all of the avenues in terms of government support and has been placed on waiting lists for both Government housing assistance and North Coast Community Housing.
""They don't know how long the wait is for both, but we've moved up the list for housing assistance,"" he said.
He pleaded for anyone with a private vacant or upcoming rental property to give him ""a break"".
""Please give me a go, I have two little girls and they deserve their own rooms in their own home,"" he said.
Mr Townsend can be contacted on 0458 510 442.
Owner of Casino Real Estate Mark Simpkins said social media was partially to blame for the decline in owners choosing to rent their property through an agent.
""They can use it to find their own tenants,"" he said.
""People seem to know about a source or know when people are moving out of properties before the real estate does.
""People are going with people they know over real estates these days.
He advised Mr Townsend to keep applying for properties.
""I don't see anything about his situation as a problem,"" he said.
""If they can make the rent of a week, have a good rental history and have good references, that is basically what I work off in my business.
""Deciding on the tennant is the owners decision ultimately, we just present them with all the information.""
A Family and Community Services spokesperson said the NSW Government supports people to maintain tenancies in the private market with things like a loan to secure a rental bond or a subsidy if people get into rent arrears as a result of an unavoidable event.
""FACS Housing operates Rentstart to provide financial assistance for eligible clients to help them set up or maintain a tenancy in the private rental market,"" they said.
""Under Rentstart, FACS Housing may be able to assist a person with a loan of up to 75 per cent of their rental bond to establish a tenancy in the private market. The loan is interest free and repayable to FACS Housing.""

"Tassal salmon plan to win over King Island locals flounders after invitation bungle
Updated
Tasmania's biggest salmon company has cut ties with an American PR company it was using to sell its controversial plan to farm fish off King Island, after the firm spruiked an event using the names of people and groups who had not been invited.
Tassal engaged the US-based ""retail and food service consulting"" firm Route to Market, to set up a ""round table"" with King Island locals to promote its proposal to explore industrially farmed Atlantic salmon off the northern coast of the island, including near the world-famous surf break at Martha Lavinia.
The fish farming giant's plan has raised the ire of some King Island locals and like-minded surfers, who in January launched a boycott of Tassal products.
In an emailed invitation sent to various stakeholders and obtained by the ABC, Route to Market principal Jennifer Bushman described the two-day event in July as ""an important conversation about the fish farming that is proposed in your region.""
The invitation describes Ms Bushman as ""an award-winning author and chef"" and ""one of the food and lifestyle industry's most respected consultants, communicators, marketers and strategists"" who is ""deeply concerned with ocean wellbeing"".
Ms Bushman has ""spent more than a decade advocating ocean health and solutions that might lead to its sustained well being,"" it reads.
Aussie pro-surfer enlisted to 'change the tide'
Route to Market recently released Full Circle, a video featuring Australian-born, Hawaii-based champion surfer Jamie Mitchell, in what Ms Bushman has explained as an attempt to ""change the tide on how people feel about sustainable aquaculture"", with a visit to a fish farming enterprise in Chile.
""I don't ever want to have to explain to my daughters someday what a tuna tasted like,"" Mr Mitchell is quoted as saying.
After Full Circle premiered, Ms Bushman explained ""it was (surf website) Surfline that brought to our attention the issues surrounding aquaculture in Tasmania and specifically King Island"".
""We were invited to try and help begin a conversation and to be educated ourselves about what was happening in the region,"" she said.
In the email, Ms Bushman said the Tassal event on King Island was to be attended by ""scientists from your area, shark experts"" and representatives from ""Surfrider Foundation Australia, Surfline and World Wildlife Fund"".
""I believe that there is a solution somewhere within all of our passion and beliefs to all co-exist,"" she wrote.
The problem was, some of the groups mentioned as being involved had no knowledge of the meeting, or that they'd been included as stakeholders in the agenda.
Craig McIntrye from the Surfrider Foundation wrote to Tassal asking the company to remove the names of its members from the agenda and promotional materials.
""We have received no invitation to this event, or any contact from Tassal or Route To Market regarding our attendance,"" Mr McIntyre said in the letter.
""This gives the clear the impression to invitees who are being forwarded this information that we support the round table and will be attending, when in truth, we have not been invited, do not endorse the event and would not have known about it in the absence of receiving concerned calls from community members asking if the event was legitimate.""
'Astro-turfing' fail, says environment group
Mr McIntyre said he believed Tassal had ""sought to garner legitimacy for the event and induce community members to attend"".
Environment Tasmania's Laura Kelly said Tassal's decision to engage Route To Market was a ""cynical PR effort"" and an attempt at ""astro-turfing"" — a professional marketing method designed to give the impression of grass-roots community support.
Ms Kelly said the plan had ""reallly backfired on the company"" and that ""a lot of trust has been degraded"".
""It seems that our names were used to lend credibility to attract surfers who were undecided ... to convince them that industrial salmon farming was the best way to protect the environment.""
In a statement, a Tassal spokesman said ""the Route To Market concept is a globally accepted concept and has worked well in international salmon farming jurisdictions and we believe it has positive application here"".
Despite that, Tassal confirmed it was no longer using Route To Market.
Tassal planned to meet directly with the Surfrider Foundation ""one-on-one in the first instance, as we are keen to learn what the actual environmental concerns it has"", the spokesman said.
""We remain committed to learning from all interest groups and are always keen to explore programs which centre around shared values processes.""
In an email to the ABC, Jennifer Bushman said her intention was only to help ""community members to learn and possibly find common ground"".
""It was cancelled because we couldn't persuade the community to join us.
""We were extremely disappointed as we felt there was a lot to learn on all sides.""

"MSP is the price at which the govt purchases crops from the farmers, whatever may be the price for the crops.
MSP scheme serves the purpose of protecting farmers from distress sale and procurement of food for public distribution system.
New Delhi: Keen to address the concerns of farmers in the run up to Lok Sabha polls next year and with the aim of fulfilling its 2014 poll promise of doubling their income, the BJP-led NDA government on Wednesday announced a massive hike of upto 50 per cent in the minimum support price (MSP) of kharif crops.
The MSP for paddy has been raised by around Rs 250 per quintal and ragi saw an increase of Rs 997 per quintal. The move, though, could lead to inflation in the long run.
However, home minister Rajnath Singh, who announced the decision after the Union Cabinet meeting, dismissed fears of possible inflation.
“We are concerned about inflation. It is not correct to say that inflation will go up. We have controlled inflation in last four years and will succeed in controlling it in future as well,” he said.
The hike in MSP will cost the exchequer over Rs 15,000 crore, he added. Minimum support price (MSP) is the price at which the government purchases crops from the farmers, whatever may be the price for the crops.
The MSP scheme serves the purpose of protecting farmers from distress sale and procurement of food for public distribution system.
The MSP hike is clearly a political move as it has come just six months before the BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisg-arh and Rajasthan — where the party faces heavy anti-incumbency — go to polls in December this year.
The BJP is keen to bolster its prospects in these politically crucial states, especially Madhya Pradesh, which had witnessed a bloody farmers’ agitation in June last year, when six farmers were killed in police firing while protesting for better price for their produce. The three-BJP ruled states together send 65 MPs to Lok Sabha.
The Narendra Modi-led government has fast tracked the upward revision of MSP despite lack of unanimity among farmer leaders and states, till last week, on fixing prices for all summer crops.
Mr Modi had, however, clearly said after his meeting with sugarcane farmers last week, that the Union Cabinet will take a call on MSP for kharif crops soon.
Subsequently, the Union Cabinet hiked the price paid to farmers for paddy by a record Rs 250 per quintal and by up to 52 per cent fir the other summer-sown crops.
With this decision, the NDA government has fulfilled its election promise of providing farmers 1.5 times of their cost of producing a crop.
Wednesday’s decision covers 14 kharif crops including paddy, cotton, soyabean, ragi, bajra, maize and some pulses. MSP using the same principle for rabi crops, like wheat and mustard, is yet to be announced.
The previous highest hike in paddy MSP was Rs 170 a quintal in the 2012-13 crop year. In the last four years, the NDA government has raised the paddy MSP between `50-80 per quintal.
Reacting to the decision, Mr Modi said the government has fulfilled its promise of hiking the minimum support price to 1.5 times the production cost of farming produce and said the government is committed to the development of the agriculture sector.
“I am very happy that the promise made by the government to our farmer brothers and sisters of giving minimum support price at 1.5 times the production cost has been fulfilled. There has been a historic increase in the MSP. Congratulations to all farmers,” he tweeted in Hindi.
The government’s price advisory body Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) has calculated production cost of paddy at Rs 1,166 per quintal and the government has raised the MSP of paddy (common grade) by over Rs 250 to Rs 1,750 per quintal for 2018-19 season.
The support price of Grade A variety of paddy has been raised by `180 per quintal to Rs 1,770. The increase in paddy MSP is 50-51 per cent over its production cost.
Paddy is the main kharif (summer sown) crop, the sowing of which has already begun with the onset of southwest monsoon.
India is estimated to have harvested a record foodgrains production at 279.51 million tonnes in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) on all-time high output of rice, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses.
Reacting to the big hike in MSP of kharif crops, the Congress said the hike in minimum support price (MSP) for kharif crops, announced by the government today, was a “jumla” (rhetoric) and “electoral lollypop” aimed at wooing farmers ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election.
“The MSP declared today does not fulfil the promise of cost plus 50 per cent of produce. If this is not betrayal with farmers, what is it?” he asked.
“Farmers have been duped yet again. This MSP does not fulfil the promise of giving cost plus 50 per cent to farmers as per CACP recommendations. It is a betrayal with the farmers. This is merely a PR exercise on MSP and is a mere ‘electoral lollypop’,” he told reporters.
Reacting to the decision, Yogendra Yadav, president of Swaraj India and founder of Jai Kisan Andolan, while giving credit to farmers’ organisation for forcing the Centre to act on the issue, said that “it is a small victory for farmers. In this election year, the Modi government has been forced to partially act, at least on paper, on the promise of remunerative MSP that it had made before the previous election”.
Mr Yadav cautioned that the MSP announcement is not the price computed at 50 per cent above comprehensive cost (C2) being demanded by farmers’ organisations. Also it is not the price promised by Mr Modi in hundreds of election meetings and contained in the 2014 election manifesto of BJP.
“It is not an immediate relief to farmers. It is merely a promise, the fulfilment of which depends on government procurement and intensive support, something that has been lacking till now,” he added.",www.asianage.com,2018-07-05 05:32:00,45,236629

"rugby union
All Blacks captain Kieran Read will return to the Canterbury Crusaders lineup for their Super Rugby clash against the Otago Highlanders on Friday after recovering from back surgery.
The 32-year-old back-rower underwent a medical procedure late last year to correct a bulging disc in his back that was causing chronic leg pain.
Read, who trained with the All Blacks in June and made himself a ""pain in the butt"" according to coach Steve Hansen, played a warm-up match for provincial side Counties-Manukau last week and is now ready to step up to Super Rugby level.
He will start at number eight for the clash at Rugby League Park, which has been temporarily renamed ""Wyatt Crockett Stadium"" in honor of the loosehead prop, who will play his 200th Super Rugby match on Friday.
The 35-year-old Crockett has already announced this season would be his last in Super Rugby. He made his debut in 2006 and has won three titles in the southern hemisphere competition.
""I am honored to have represented a team that I am immensely proud of for the past 13 years,"" Crockett, who also earned 71 All Blacks caps, said on Wednesday. And to have the opportunity to reach 200 games at home, in front of my family and friends, is something I know I'll look back on fondly at the end of my Super Rugby career. I'm humbled by the support I've received this season and throughout my rugby career, which has made each game I've played for this club just as memorable and special as the last.""
Crockett is already the most-capped player in Super Rugby and consequently will be the first to reach 200 appearances in the competition.
""To play so many matches at this level is testament to his professionalism and strength of character,"" SANZAAR CEO Andy Marinos said in a statement.
""He has been an outstanding servant and ambassador to the game of rugby and, of course, to the Crusaders since his Super Rugby debut in 2006. We wish him all the very best on Friday against the Highlanders.""
The Crusaders top the Super Rugby table on 54 points and are looking strong favourites to defend their title, with Read's return ahead of the playoffs a massive boost to their chances.
Victory over the Highlanders would guarantee them top seeding and home advantage throughout the playoffs, which start in two weeks.

"Rohingya crisis: Bangladesh to deploy thousands of police to refugee camps to improve safety
Posted
Bangladesh is deploying thousands of extra police to Rohingya refugee camps in the south, officials said, after a series of mostly unexplained killings that have sown fear among hundreds of thousands of people who have fled from neighbouring Myanmar.
Key points: Since August, 19 people including community leaders have been killed in refugee camps
Killings are often conducted by groups of armed men, at night
UN rights chief says the cards are an attempt to continue marking Rohingya as non-citizens
Since August, when a military crackdown in Myanmar forced many of the Muslim minority to cross the border into Bangladesh and seek shelter in the crowded camps, 19 people, some of them community leaders, have been killed.
Police have made a number of arrests in connection with some of the killings, but say the motives often remain unclear.
Conducted after dark and often by groups of men wielding pistols, knives, and sticks, the killings have sent a chill through the camps, which are guarded by the Bangladesh army during the day but manned by fewer police officers at night.
AKM Iqbal Hossain, police superintendent of the coastal town of Cox's Bazar under whose jurisdiction the camps fall, said a special force of roughly 2,400 men was being formed to guard the refugees.
A second senior officer, Superintendent Afrujul Haque Tutul, said police numbers were already being increased.
""We have 1,000 police officers right now for a million people, so you can imagine,"" he said.
More than 700,000 Rohingya have taken shelter in Cox's Bazar district since August, joining thousands who were already living there, making it the world's largest and fastest growing refugee camp.
Even before the August exodus, there had been violence in the camps, which Bangladesh police and aid workers have previously blamed on a struggle for control of supplies to the camps.
The latest killing, of 35-year-old Arifullah, took place last month on a busy road outside the Balukhali camp, where he had been appointed a leader of thousands of refugees.
A group of men surrounded him on the evening of June 18, stabbing him at least 25 times, police said.
A pool of blood stained the spot the next morning.
Police said three Rohingya men had been arrested over the killing of Arifullah, who spoke English, had worked for international agencies in Myanmar, and often met foreign delegates who visited the camps.
Thousands still fleeing Myanmar: UN rights chief
So far this year, 11,432 have arrived in Bangladesh, where more than 700,000 have fled since an August 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state, United Nations human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.
""No amount of rhetoric can whitewash these facts,"" Mr Zeid said.
""People are still fleeing persecution in Rakhine — and are even willing to risk dying at sea to escape.""
Many Rohingya refugees also report being pressured by Myanmar authorities to accept a national verification card that says they need to apply for citizenship, he said.
The citizenship issue is at the core of discussions on their status, Mr Zeid said, adding that the cards ""mark the Rohingya as non-citizens, in keeping with the government's characterisation of them as foreigners in their own homeland"".
Authorities in mainly Buddhist Myanmar deny carrying out large scale human rights abuses.
Authorities say a crackdown in Rakhine is a necessary response to violence by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) militant group, which attacked Myanmar security posts.

"Asian teams will have high hopes for the next World Cup in 2022.
By Talek HARRIS
Asian teams weren't expected to make an impact at the World Cup but a record points haul and some stunning performances against top sides have lifted their hopes for Qatar 2022.
South Korea's 2-0 dethroning of defending champions Germany could have been viewed as a one-off, if not for Japan's heartbreaking defeat to star-studded Belgium days later in the last 16.
Iran also came desperately close to beating Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal, the European title-holders, in another sign that smaller teams may be closing the gap on the game's traditional powers.
None of the Asian Football Confederation teams reached the quarterfinals, extending a barren run which stretches back to the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea.
But Japan, South Korea and Iran departed Russia with their heads held high and positive expectations for Qatar 2022, when the World Cup returns to AFC territory for the first time in 20 years.
""The AFC nations can take great encouragement from this year's World Cup,"" Andy Jackson of FourFourTwo magazine told AFP.
""They can look forward to 2022 and an AFC-hosted World Cup in Qatar with the hope of being one of the nations causing some of the famous upsets we've seen so far in Russia.""
AFC teams amassed 15 points in Russia, their best showing yet -- and overshadowing Africa's representatives Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Tunisia and Senegal, who went home after the group stage with 11 points between them.
However, Saudi Arabia, another AFC side, never recovered from their 5-0 spanking by Russia in the tournament's opening game, and Australia -- the Asian champions -- also had a World Cup to forget.
Despite looking competitive in their group games against France, Denmark and Peru, the Socceroos failed to win a game and they went home without scoring a goal from open play.
Out of the Asian teams, Japan emerged with the most credit after they reached the last 16 and were 2-0 up against Belgium with 21 minutes to go -- before the Belgians launched one of the great World Cup comebacks, clinching a 3-2 win in injury time.
""Japan showed great quality and character to battle bravely with one of the best teams in the tournament,"" said AFC president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa. ""Their success exemplifies the great progress of Asian teams to stand proud with the world's elite.""
Japan's image was also burnished by images of their fans tidying up stadiums after games -- while a picture of Japan's spotless changing room, with a thank you note in Russian, went viral after the Belgium defeat.
""This Japanese team and its supporters left with their heads held high and their standing and respect in world football greatly enhanced,"" Jackson said.

"MEXICO CITY: Mario Sepulveda, one of the Chilean miners who was trapped underground for 69 days in 2010, had a moving message of encouragement on Wednesday (Jul 4) for the boys' football team trapped in a cave in Thailand: ""Hang in there!""
In a video message sent to AFP, Sepulveda - known as ""Super Mario"" for helping keep his comrades' spirits up during their ordeal - said his thoughts were with the 12 boys and their coach, so much so that he is trying to organise a trip to Thailand to help.

The mission to rescue the football team from their flooded cave has resurrected memories of the Chilean mining accident eight years ago.
Then, the world held its breath as Sepulveda and 32 others survived nearly 10 weeks underground before finally being hauled to the surface one by one.
Dressed in a yellow vest, orange miner's helmet and headlamp, Sepulveda sent a brief but energetic message to the members of the Wild Boar football team in a 40-second video.
""Mucha fuerza!"" he told them - which roughly translates as ""Hang in there"" or ""Much strength.""

He said he was trying to raise funds to travel to Thailand himself and help the rescue effort however he can.
""I'm going to see what's possible. I'm calling someone from the (Chilean) government to try to get some money together. I think it's important as a country for us to be there, after what we miners went through,"" he told AFP during a visit to Mexico City.
""I would love to go. I think it would be extremely important to support the families, give them a hug. Words of encouragement are important.""
MEMORIES OF 2010
The trapped boys, who range in age from 11 to 16, were exploring the cave with their coach 11 days ago after football training when rising flood waters trapped them inside.
British divers found them on Monday night, huddling on a muddy ledge above surging underground waters, more than four kilometres inside one of the country's longest caves. A new video on Wednesday showed them in good spirits.
A massive international rescue operation is exploring the options to get them out, none of them simple - just like in the case of the miners trapped in 2010.
""I don't have the slightest doubt that if the (Thai) government give it everything they have and make every humanly possible effort, the rescue will be a success,"" said Sepulveda, a gregarious dynamo who speaks in a swirling torrent of words.
FROM HELL TO HOLLYWOOD
Rescuers say there are three main options to extract the boys: diving out of the cave system, exiting through another hole if one can be found - or drilled - or waiting out the monsoon season underground.
Diving out is risky, since the boys have never dived before and some may not be able to swim. Sepulveda urged the authorities to waste no time and spare no expense.
""What we need here is for the Thai government to put in a lot of money, and whoever else wants to donate, and get professional divers in there to get those boys out now,"" he said.
""They need to teach them to dive as quickly as possible.""
Sepulveda, 47, was one of the leaders of the miners trapped underground at the San Jose copper and gold mine in northern Chile's Atacama desert.
Today, the married father of two has reinvented himself as a motivational speaker.

"Mary Shelley biopic: Elle Fanning stars in disappointingly conventional take on wildly unconventional creator of Frankenstein
Posted
The cinematic potential of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein was recognised in the very early days of the medium.
Since first being adapted for the screen in 1910, the novel has served as inspiration for a diverse bunch of filmmakers, including Paul Morrissey, Mel Brooks, and Tim Burton. As played by Boris Karloff, Frankenstein's monster is one of the most iconic characters in film history.
Meanwhile, the cinematic potential of Shelley's own life has been largely overlooked. The daughter of proto-feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft and political philosopher William Godwin, the wife of the interminably Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the mother of science-fiction, Mary Shelley's biography is as rich in historical significance as in scandal and tragedy, and so — in these biopic-happy times — seems ripe for dramatisation.
With the release of Haifaa al-Mansour's Mary Shelley — more than 100 years after Frankenstein's monster made his silver screen debut, and 200 years after his creation — Shelley gets her star treatment, a rosy-cheeked Elle Fanning stepping into the role.
The film spans the author's tumultuous late teenage years — from her elopement with Percy Shelley (played here by the vampiric Douglas Booth) at the tender age of 16, to the fateful stormy summer they spent with Lord Byron in Geneva, during which Mary would conceive of Frankenstein, and on to its publication in 1818, when she was merely 20.
It's a teen romance movie dressed up in period garb: her development as a writer is entangled with the development of her relationship with Percy, with all of its torrid ups and desperate downs.
Mary Shelley seems like something of a departure for director al-Mansour, who came to international attention in 2012 with her debut feature Wadjda — the story of a spirited 10-year-old schoolgirl (Waad Mohammed) living in Riyadh, on a mission to raise enough money to purchase a coveted green bicycle.
Wadjda broke new cinematic ground: not only was it the first film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia — a country that has only just lifted its 35-year ban on cinemas — but also the first made by a female Saudi director.
Certainly, no-one who saw Wadjda could have anticipated al-Mansour's next feature would be a polished period drama about a card-carrying member of the Western literary canon.
And yet, Wadjda and Mary Shelley have more in common than initially appears the case. Despite taking place in radically different places and times, both films are centred on a headstrong young woman in the process of learning how to navigate an ultra-patriarchal environment.
Both women push against the gendered boundaries imposed on them by society, and find society pushes back. Wadjda is scolded for her desire to ride a bike — an activity reserved for men. ""Ever seen a girl on a bike?"" cries her exasperated mother. Mary struggles to find a publisher for her manuscript. ""Curious subject matter for a young lady,"" one sneers.
As a feminist take on its subject's life, however, Mary Shelley falls short, ultimately unable to reconcile its critique of the men in Mary's life with the requirements of the romance genre.
The film insists Frankenstein was directly inspired by the misery Mary experienced due to Percy's philandering and neglect, but then presents its publication as vindicating their love, with Mary absolving her husband of responsibility for her suffering. ""My choices made me what I am, and I regret nothing,"" she states — a line presumably meant to be understood as a declaration of autonomy, but comes off sounding like internalised victim-blaming instead.
Impaired by clunky dialogue and an overbearing score, the film offers a disappointingly conventional account of a wildly unconventional relationship. As the story of someone who supposedly lost her virginity on her mother's grave, it's too vanilla by half.
Mary Shelley wants for a proper injection of Gothicism — a little less Jane Austen, a little more Ken Russell, if you will. As it stands, the sensational source material fails to scintillate as it should.

"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
Bank of Japan board member Yutaka Harada warned on Wednesday that raising interest rates quickly would severely damage financial institutions, underscoring market views that the central bank would go slow in exiting crisis-mode stimulus.
“If interest rates are actually hiked, that would lower bond and stock prices, hurt businesses through a rise in the yen, and increase credit costs, which would hit financial institutions hard,” Harada said in the text of a speech to business leaders in the western coastal city of Kanazawa.
Harada, a former academic known as a vocal advocate of bold monetary easing, has voted with the majority of the central bank’s board including its decision in 2016 to shift to targeting interest rates instead of the pace of money printing.
The central bank should continue its current easing policy, which is having its intended effects, in order to achieve its 2 percent inflation target, Harada said. Further easing would be needed if inflation lost momentum, he added.
While the BOJ is seen lagging well behind other central banks in unwinding crisis-mode stimulus, investors expect no further easing either because of concerns that its massive money printing is hurting the bond market and bank profits.
The central bank is likely to cut its price growth forecasts at a policy meeting ending on July 31 as long-term inflation expectations stall, sources told Reuters on Tuesday.
At that meeting, the central bank’s board will conduct a quarterly review of its long-term growth and price projections, and scrutinize why inflation remains stubbornly weak, despite the jobless rate at near 26-year low of 2.2 percent.
Annual core consumer inflation, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, held steady at 0.7 percent in May, well below the BOJ’s 2 percent target.
“To achieve the 2 percent price goal, the current jobless rate needs to fall further,” Harada said. “That doesn’t mean that we should continue monetary easing until the jobless rate hits 2 percent though.”
Harada is considered as among those on the nine-member board who promote the positive effect that massive injections of money could have on the economy and inflation, rather than the demerits of prolonged easing such as the hit to banks’ margins.
Still, he has steered clear of calling for ramping up stimulus, distancing himself from the view of board member Goshi Kataoka who argues the BOJ should ease further to ensure its price goal is met quickly.

A heatwave in Quebec has killed at least 17 people in the past week as high summer temperatures scorched eastern Canada, health officials said Wednesday.
Twelve of the dead were reported in the eastern province's capital Montreal, said regional public health director Mylene Drouin. The Tribune newspaper said five of the deaths occurred in the past 48 hours in the Eastern Townships, a rural area just east of the city.
""My thoughts are with the loved ones of those who have died in Quebec during this heat wave,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter.
""The record temperatures are expected to continue in central and eastern Canada, so make sure you know how to protect yourself and your family,"" Trudeau said.
Drouin said the victims were part of ""the very vulnerable population, the elderly or people suffering from chronic or mental illnesses.""
Temperatures soared to 34 degrees Celsius (93 Fahrenheit) with a humidity that made it feel closer to 40 degrees, the meteorological service said. The mercury has regularly topped 30 degrees since Friday in southern Quebec, accompanied by stifling humidity levels.
A government heat warning is in place for the region, but meteorologists are forecasting a drop in temperatures at the end of the week.
No deaths had been reported for the same period in the neighboring province of Ontario, which has also sizzled under extremely high temperatures.
In 2010, a heat wave killed around 100 people in the Montreal area.

Indie Armstrong was one of two babies born on the Leap Year on February 29, 2012. Her story featured in the March 1, 2012, edition of the Sunshine Coast Daily .
""Everyone was drawn to her and she was a soft, caring and friendly little girl,"" he said. ""She had a piercing smile with big brown eyes.""
Indie was the little sister of eight-year-old Lily, big sister to Sunny and dearly loved daughter of Jason and Emily.
Mr Armstrong said Indie had shared a wonderful bond with her siblings, recalling how she would help Sunny with his breakfast, ""mushing it up"".
""She always wanted to make sure everyone around her was okay and she had the biggest heart,"" he said.

"Melbourne housing affordability not helped by political party posturing, say experts
Posted
It's expected to take a small tumble by the end of the year, but the apparent softening of Melbourne's property market has little to do with the housing affordability measures being championed by Victoria's major political parties, according to experts.
Instead, the market's deterioration is being attributed to weaker trends in clearance rates and asking prices, and not to the political class, which has been accused of dragging its feet on a key issue for many Victorians.
""I don't think either party's doing enough,"" said Jason Byrne, a professor of planning at the University of Tasmania.
""We're just simply moving the pieces,"" he said.
More houses doesn't mean lower prices
On Tuesday, Victoria's Opposition Leader Matthew Guy announced that he would be an ""interventionist"" premier, who would flood the state's housing market with 290,000 lots for new homes in Melbourne's outer suburbs.
Labor's policies Abolished stamp duty for first home buyers for properties under $600,000, with sliding scale discounts on properties worth up to $750,000
Imposing a new one per cent tax on vacant residential properties
Doubling first home owner grant for buyers in regional Victoria for new dwellings only
Creating 17 new suburbs and rezoning 100,000 housing blocks Liberal policy Plan to 'flush the market with land', creating 290,000 lots for new homes in outer suburbs by 2020
First part of a five-pillar plan
More policy to be announced in the run-up to the November state election
It's the first part of his five-pillar plan to tackle housing affordability in the state.
But experts in Victoria and interstate have cast doubt on the policy's effectiveness.
""More housing does not necessarily translate to lower prices,"" Professor Byrne said.
""Simply releasing more lots is unlikely to result in price reductions,"" agreed Jago Dodson, who leads the Centre for Urban Research at RMIT University.
""Landholders and developers tend to drip feed into the market rather than collapse prices,"" he said.
Professor Byrne was also concerned that flooding the market with ""marginally cheaper"" housing will just mean other parts of a homeowner living on the edge of the city will become more expensive.
""If people still can't afford to live on the outskirts of a city, spend a lot of their income in commuting, don't have access to jobs nearby, we might just eventually see a transfer of cost to the individual,"" he said.
According to Peter Phibbs, a professor of urban planning at the University of Sydney, it's well known that cheap housing can come at more than just a monetary cost.
""There's a lot of research that shows those long commutes ... are pretty bad for your physical and your mental wellbeing, particularly over the longer term,"" he said.
Mr Guy's plan is comparable to Labor's, which has announced it's rezoning 100,000 housing blocks in Melbourne's north and west, and create 17 new suburbs.
Ben Phillips, from Australian National University, co-authored a paper which found that while increasing housing supply had some benefits, it was ""unlikely in isolation to create affordable housing in Australia"".
""Even though you're increasing land supply, you're really only doing it at the edges,"" Associate Professor Phillips said.
""Having a small increase in land supply over a number of years may only be a very small increase to what was already planned anyway.
""So the impact, whilst it might sound impressive, is probably only fairly limited.""
Services could be more than a decade away
Then there's the bipartisan problem of access to businesses, services and infrastructure.
""They're not just going to up and move in overnight,"" said Professor Byrne.
""If you want to attract the likes of IBM or google to an outer suburban location what's in it for them? They need to make sure they've got trained workforces nearby that they have the right skills in that locality,"" he said.
""Even if we're talking just regular small business owners to those localities, they want to make sure that there's enough of a market for them to set up.
""If businesses do start up eventually moving in five, 10, 15 years down the track, that's a long time for people to have to commute elsewhere to find jobs.""
Labor maintains all of its communities will be fully planned with access to key infrastructure.
Similarly, a Guy Coalition Government has announced it will fast track precinct structure plan approvals, which refers to the high-level master blueprints which map out roads, schools and services.
Tax plan panned
In addition to 17 new suburbs, Labor has also announced it's slashing stamp duty for first home buyers and levying a tax on vacant properties.
But that's been panned by Professor Phibbs.
""Some people just call them vendor grants,"" he said.
""You're essentially pushing up prices in markets that first home buyers can afford. It's not really an enduring benefit.
""What happens is ... you've got all these first home buyers that have got a bit of extra cash in their product courtesy of the Government and they simply bid more for the property.
""That's not really a sustainable housing affordability policy.""
In previous comments to the ABC, Mr Guy seemed to be against stamp duty concessions, instead pointing to a supply problem. He's yet to fully announce the rest of his housing affordability plan.
The Coalition's plans to unlock the land was welcomed by the Urban Development Institute of Australia, which said it would be ""music to the development industry's ears"".
The institute's Victorian chief, Danni Addison, said the current system was costing buyers.
""We must make sure new homes in our fastest growing communities remain within the reach of purchasers both in terms of price and accessibility,"" Ms Addison said.
""To make this work there needs to be fundamental reform in the way councils and state government agencies plan and deliver infrastructure to growth areas.""
Need to tackle negative gearing
Ultimately, the experts contacted by the ABC to dissect the future of Victoria's housing affordability plans agreed that not enough was being done.
""I think what both those policies show is [an] unfortunate continuation of an Australian trend,"" Professor Phibbs said.
""To look like you're doing something about housing affordability and housing policy, but not actually doing anything that's all that effective.""
They've called for a more comprehensive approach on a federal level, which would tackle capital gains tax and negative gearing.
""It's not something we'll certainly solve overnight,"" said Professor Byrne.
""It requires bipartisan support and it requires some careful strategising and thinking, rather than just a knee-jerk reaction of, 'Let's create another 300,000 properties on the outskirts of a city.""
""That's only going to exacerbate the problem.""

"Driverless, autonomous cars present ethical challenges — so how do we write the laws?
Updated
Driverless cars could make our roads safer and reduce congestion. But the algorithms driving them will also have to make life-or-death decisions.
At some stage in the future, a fully autonomous car may determine who lives and who dies on our roads.
These machines are being tested right now and Australian politicians are looking overseas for leadership, emboldened by the promise of fewer fatalities and less congestion.
At the moment, there must be a human behind the wheel of these cars at all times, but government agencies are already working on a legal framework for when machines are totally in control.
The Germans — with an established car industry — have developed some simple rules: the machine must harm the fewest possible people and treat all life equally.
So what would you do?
You're approaching a pedestrian crossing. The autonomous system is working but the brakes fail. A crash is unavoidable.
A car programmed to harm the fewest possible people would swerve into a wall, injuring you, rather than hit the three pedestrians.
Do you agree with this decision?
If you ask Australia's chief scientist, Alan Finkel, German lawmakers are trying to reduce a tough moral argument about the value of human life into a simple formula.
He says scenarios like this one trigger difficult but necessary discussions about ethics, the value of human life and how we regulate technology.
While Australia is a few years away from seeing fully autonomous cars hit the roads, Dr Finkel says it's time for a serious debate about whether a legal framework like the German one would work here.
These are the stages of autonomous cars:
A little help with steering, acceleration. More help keeping you in your lane, cruise control. The machine starts to take over, but only in very controlled environments. We're getting to this stage now. Fully autonomous but not in every circumstance. Completely autonomous with performance equal or better than human drivers.
In crude terms, the German rules specify that if a crash is unavoidable, a car would be programmed to hurt the fewest people possible.
The machine's algorithms wouldn't consider a person's family ties, profession, fame, criminal record, gender, age or any other factors.
""It's a sensible rule but is it the right rule?"" Dr Finkel asks.
""Well, that's for ethicists and politicians to debate.""
It's a debate that gets more complex and delicate when real humans are involved.
You're approaching road works. Your child is in the car. Pedestrians walk into the free lane without looking.
With no time to brake, a car programmed to harm the fewest possible people would hit the road works. That would injure you and your child, but save the pedestrians.
Would you buy a car that makes this decision?
Germany is home to some of the world's biggest car companies and these rules are an attempt to give manufacturers certainty before they develop fully autonomous vehicles.
""They must be able to rely on absolutely clear ethical principles being observed in the development and design of technology,"" the German guidelines say.
These are the German ethical rules:
Human safety must come first
All humans are considered equal
The fewest people possible must be harmed
Companies are liable
Companies must be transparent
Whether we agree with these rules or not, they raise a question about what role government should play in regulating an industry and technology that is still developing.
The Federal Government has been accused of lagging on driverless cars, but it's set aside $30 million to improve machine learning and develop a new ""artificial intelligence ethics framework"".
That will guide the ""responsible development"" of technology and could eventually serve a similar function to the German rules.
The National Transport Commission (NTC), which advises federal and state governments on this issue, is now working on new laws for driverless cars. It's already developed rules for trials across Australia.
Current driverless car trials in Australia:
The NSW Government and Transurban are testing stage-two autonomous cars from seven different companies until August
Driverless shuttlebuses are being trialled in Perth, Sydney and Ipswich
The ACT Government is supporting a two-year trial involving 40 drivers
The Victorian and South Australian governments allow trials on public roads. VicRoads has partnered with BMW, Mercedes, Tesla and Volvo
Some car manufacturers think it's too early to develop these laws, given we're a long way away from stage-five autonomous cars and we don't know what the technology will look like in a decade.
But others, like the Transport Workers Union, want the Government to act now to ensure difficult decisions are not influenced by commercial interests.
""Leaving these decisions to technology and its programmers is unacceptable,"" the union told a Senate hearing.
That would leave the Government to regulate tough decisions like these.
You're driving down a narrow suburban street when a child suddenly runs into the road. There's no time to brake.
Your car could swerve to avoid the child, but on either side it would hit an obstruction, injuring you. Alternatively, it could hit the child but save you. The German ethical guidelines are unclear.
Would you save yourself?
It's an uncomfortable reality, but a car programmed to harm the fewest possible people might be compelled, in some circumstances, to sacrifice passengers to save others.
This presents a challenge for companies trying to sell those cars.
Research from MIT shows while people overwhelmingly support driverless cars being programmed to hurt the fewest people possible in an unavoidable crash, they don't want to be in them.
Mercedes Benz boss Christoph von Hugo was widely misquoted in 2016 as saying his cars would prioritise passengers over pedestrians.
The company went on the front foot, saying it was simply illegal for a machine to weigh up the value of life and this could only be solved through a lengthy legal and ethical debate.
Hussein Dia, a civil engineer who researches driverless cars for Swinburne University, says this proves why some form of the German rules is necessary.
""We need to have that discussion quickly or it's going to be dictated to us,"" he told the ABC.
The German rules redefine our understanding of who is liable for accidents and highlight a change that's likely coming to Australia.
When humans make split-second decisions behind the wheel of a car, those decisions have consequences. If we're negligent we may face an insurance claim and, in serious cases, criminal prosecution.
So when an accident does occur, will it be the passenger or the manufacturer who is held responsible?
""Today, a lot of our liability regimes are premised on liability sitting with the driver, but in a world where the vehicle is completely in control, it doesn't make sense to attach liability to the passengers,"" Victoria's Urban Infrastructure Minister, Paul Fletcher, says.
The Federal Opposition takes a similar approach, saying we need to have these discussions now before fully autonomous cars become available.
These aren't hypothetical arguments, because driverless cars — even at this early stage, with a passenger behind the wheel — have killed people.
In March, Elaine Herzberg was killed while pushing her bike across the road. Her death was tipped as a legal test case, but the company settled with the family for an undisclosed fee.
As Dr Finkel points out, Australian courts may judge car companies more harshly than humans.
""The court understands that if you've only been given one second to make a decision, you might make a decision that another reasonable person might not have made,"" Dr Finkel says.
""We understand for human beings that it's complex. We allow a lot of different decisions to be made.
""Will we be as generous to a computerised algorithm that can run at much faster speeds than we can? I don't know.""
These questions are even more problematic when the rules don't give a clear answer on what a car should do.
When it comes to a court, how would a judge determine guilt?
You're driving through an intersection when three pedestrians cross illegally in front of you.
A car programmed to harm the fewest possible people would save the jaywalkers. With traffic in the other lane, it would have to swerve onto the footpath and injure you and a bystander.
Do you agree with this decision?
Many car manufacturers are coy when asked when fully autonomous cars will be on our roads.
In an incredibly competitive market, some are reluctant to put a date on a roll-out or give away well-guarded company plans.
But the consensus is, we're still some way away.
The majority of 300 industry figures informally polled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance say we won't see stage-five cars until at least 2030, but stage-four vehicles could roll out within the next five years.
But both sides of federal politics know they need to ensure regulation keeps pace with technological developments.
The argument is really whether they're acting fast enough.

"Benilde coach hopes to sustain momentum
1 SHARES Share Tweet
By Jerome Lagunzad
Buoyed by its strong showing in the pre-season, College of St. Benilde is being considered by many as this year’s darkhorse in the 94th NCAA seniors basketball tournament that gets going on Saturday at the Mall of Asia Arena.
But coach TY Tang knows it remains to be seen whether the Blazers really have what it takes to contend with the league’s heavyweights, guarding his optimism as much as possible for them to not get caught up with any kind of hype.
“We had a good showing in the pre-season but I don’t think it will be a real gauge on what will transpire in the coming season,” he said in a recent interview with Tempo-Bulletin, playing down their semifinals finish in the recent Filoil Premier Cup.
“I don’t think all the NCAA teams were serious enough back then. Some of them even experimented some plays and rotations and that’s exactly what pre-season is all about, especially for my veteran counterparts. They are just using those tournaments to prepare t their players for any possible in-game situations.”
Still, hopes are high within the Taft Avenue that the Blazers can finally regain the respect after they toiled in the cellar for more than one and a half decade, with their last trip to the Final Four dating back to 2002 when they even made it to the finals.
Fil-Am forward Justine Gutang, a double-double machine, could be the go-to-guy that the Blazers are looking for while highly-athletic big man Yankie Haruna will be back in the fold after sitting out last year due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury.

"Thousands of patients put at risk of exposure to tampered drugs by Queensland Ambulance Service
Updated
The Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) has been accused of botching an investigation into a drug-tampering scandal by ignoring evidence from a paramedic turned whistleblower.
The QAS also provided incomplete information to the Health Ombudsman who subsequently dismissed a complaint from an elderly patient who tried to raise the alarm.
Barbara Cook, 74, claims she was injected with water instead of the painkiller fentanyl while being treated for a broken leg in Brisbane's north in May, 2013.
Despite apparently receiving the maximum dose of 150 micrograms, she experienced no relief.
""I did a lot of screaming,"" Ms Cook told Background Briefing and 7.30.
""It was almost a primordial thing. I couldn't control the screaming.""
Given the potency of fentanyl, Professor Kate Leslie, an anaesthetist at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, said any patient in Ms Cook's situation should have felt something.
""It would be unusual for there to be no effect if a sufficient quantity had been given,"" she said.
Tampering evidence dismissed as 'faulty manufacturing'
Months later, Ms Cook developed an infection caused by bacteria called pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is commonly found in water.
""It can become life-threatening,"" said Professor Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at Canberra Hospital.
""It's much more difficult to treat because it's resistant to most of the antibiotics we've got.""
Ms Cook's son-in-law, Timothy Watkins, who had been working as a paramedic, was suspicious.
Mr Watkins had previously uncovered evidence of drug tampering in the Metro North region.
He photographed a broken morphine ampoule that had been refilled with water or saline and glued back together.
When he reported this to his managers, they concluded ""faulty manufacturing"" was to blame.
In August 2013, Mr Watkins found more tampered ampoules in his drug bag while on the road.
The discovery resulted in a drug bust.
""I know a significant amount of narcotics were found to have been tampered with,"" Mr Watkins said in an interview.
Recordings show paramedic tried to raise the alarm
According to an analysis of QAS records obtained by Background Briefing and 7.30, potentially thousands of patients who were administered narcotics for pain relief in the region over a two-year period were at risk of being exposed to a tampered drug.
When Ms Cook reported her concerns to the ombudsman, her complaint was not upheld, partly on the basis that her timeline conflicted with that of the QAS.
The QAS had submitted that drug tampering had only occurred in the region over a four-week period in July to August, 2013, and that Ms Cook was treated by paramedics before then.
But recordings obtained by Background Briefing and 7.30 reveal the QAS had been given evidence suggesting the problem dated back to 2012.
""My view is the investigation was based on a false premise,"" Ms Cook said.
In a meeting with a QAS manager, Ms Cook's son-in-law, Mr Watkins, said he had proof drug tampering was happening much earlier than his superiors realised.
""It was about 14 months ago when this was first noticed,"" he can be heard saying in one recording.
But two years later, the manager said he had no memory of Mr Watkins ever making this claim.
""I don't recall that,"" the manager said.
The QAS also overlooked the testimony of the paramedic who was caught stealing and tampering with painkillers around the same time as Ms Cook alleges she was mistakenly injected with water.
The paramedic, who asked to remain anonymous, pled guilty in the Brisbane Magistrates Court to a string of drug tampering offences beginning in October, 2011.
When asked how the QAS could have missed this crucial piece of evidence, medical director Stephen Rashford did not offer an explanation.
""All I can tell you that I wasn't made aware of that of that,"" he said.
Patients have 'no idea' they were put at risk of exposure
Mr Rashford denied the QAS intentionally misled the ombudsman during its investigation into the complaint from Ms Cook.
""The connotation is we intentionally tried to cover this up, we would never do that,"" he said.
Mr Rashford did, however, acknowledge shortcomings made by staff who were tasked with getting to the bottom of the unfolding public health crisis.
""There is the old saying that if it comes down to conspiracy or incompetence, in general, it's incompetence rather than conspiracy,"" he said.
""They're not incompetent people, they just made the wrong decision.""
Mr Rashford admitted little had been done to notify patients who may have been put at risk of being exposed to a tampered drug.
""We wouldn't be able to actually even trace who might have received it,"" he said.
After trying for years to resolve the issue from within, Mr Watkins, who now lives in the United States, decided to go public with his concerns.
""It's horrible to imagine what's happened or what could have happened to these patients,"" he said.
Ms Cook is also speaking out in the hope of protecting others from a similar fate.
""A lot of other people still have no idea whatsoever that they were exposed to harm merely by being treated for pain in an ambulance on the way to hospital.""

I'VE lived here pretty much my whole life.
I went to Centenary Heights school.
Growing up in Toowoomba was pretty good.
All my friends and family live here. It's all I've basically known from my teen years.
I've worked for SILVERSHOP for about six years. It's a beautiful shop.
But I do plan on travelling - though I think I will always come back to Toowoomba. It's a pretty city and I like it here.
Where am I travelling? I've got a visa for Canada, for a working holiday kind of thing.
Marisa Hurst
I'VE worked here at SILVERSHOP since October, so about eight months or so.
I wasn't really looking to get into the jewellery business, I was just looking for a new job at the time, but once I got into it I realised its something I actually really enjoy and love. It worked out well for me.
I don't have any grand plans at the moment, no. I'm just happy here for a while.
I was born here in Toowoomba. One thing I love about the city is that even though it's a bigger sort of city, everyone sort of knows each other and it's a friendly place.
Emma Benson
I WORK at Pandora. It's so much fun. Obviously, we get to interact with customers a lot and help them find pieces (of jewellery) that mean a lot to them.
It is really satisfying working there.
I've been working there for about nine months.
I want my career to be in retail. I'm currently studying a business degree at Griffith University, so definitely wanting a career in the retail field.
I'm from Melbourne originally. I moved up here about two years ago because my partner is in the Defence Force.
I just like the community. It's so much smaller than Melbourne, and you get more of a sense of who everyone is, you've got your local customers and people you remember.
I really love it. I'd love to live here forever.
Hannah Jervis
I GREW up in Toowoomba but moved to Noosa for a little while, and then I fell pregnant with my first son, so we moved back.
I just think Toowoomba is such a family-friendly community and such a good place to raise kids - we have fantastic schools here.
My partner and I renovated our first home and then had another child - a little girl - and I've always worked in hospitality but I really wanted to try retail, just because the hours suited more school times.
So I'd never done retail before, and two months ago I got a job at Pandora and it's just the best - I love it.
What's one thing I love about Toowoomba? Probably our parks - the botanical gardens, and picnic point is lovely too.",www.thechronicle.com.au,2018-07-05 05:00:00,42,384841

A RIVALRY between Toowoomba and Mackay has started to emerge with the announcement the two cities had been short-listed as possible locations for a Qantas Pilot Training Academy.
On Monday Qantas representatives met with Toowoomba Mayor Paul Antonio, Wellcamp Airport's John Wagner and State Development Minister Cameron Dick to take a closer look at Toowoomba's bid for the facility.
At a press conference before the tour, Toowoomba Mayor Paul Antonio was asked whether there was any rivalry between the two cities over the proposals.
""I know (Mackay Mayor Greg Williamson) and respect him highly,” Mr Antonio said.
""But on this particular subject... I really think that when you look at things, have a look at Toowoomba, then have a look at Mackay.
""I'll rest my case there.”
The next day The Chronicle ran 'Memo to Qantas: Choose Toowoomba over Mackay' on its front page and the Daily Mercury was not happy.
Yesterday, Toowoomb-nahh mate was splashed on the Mackay tabloid's front page, along with a cartoon showing a plane labelled Mackay shooting down a plane labelled Toowoomba.
The story featured quotes from a number of prominent Mackay residents, including controversial Dawson MP George Christensen.
""I've been once and it was cold enough that day to not make the mistake again,” Mr Christensen said.
""If they want to have to be push starting the planes down the runways because the fuel pipes have been frozen, then Toowoomba is the right choice.”
Whitsunday MP Jason Costigan also took aim at The Chronicle's editor Steve Etwell.
""Don't get me wrong, I love the Darling Downs. Great people, love the Carnival of Flowers,” Mr Costigan said.
""However, in terms of climate and lifestyle, Mackay in the tropical north is a no brainer.
""I think deep down, even the editor of The Chronicle knows that. After all, he comes from the same place as me, the city that I represent, a city which has put a strong case forward to bring the Flying Kangaroo to town.”
Toowoomba's bid for the pilot training academy was one of nine proposals short-listed across the country.
The other eight locations, including Mackay, are Alice Springs, Bendigo, Busselton, Dubbo, Launceston, Tamworth and Wagga Wagga.
Wagners director John Wagner said the company was prepared to invest heavily in the training facility.
""Wagners are prepared to put in significant infrastructure, to the tune of $55 million, to make this thing a reality,” he said.
""The single biggest thing we bring to the table is we are not capital constrained, we make decisions quickly.
""We've got a very strong track record of bringing projects to fruition. We built Wellcamp Airport in 19 months.
""So we can have this up and running in five to six months from when they sign a commercial agreement.”
The Chronicle editor Steve Etwell said he encouraged proud Toowoomba residents to get on social media and share the hashtag #Qantas4twba, to help highlight the community support for the proposal.",www.thechronicle.com.au,2018-07-05 05:00:00,25,384874

A MAJOR extension to Queensland's oldest nursing home will be unlike anything that Toowoomba has seen before in aged care.
That's according to Brodribb Home's CEO Pam Chipperfield, as the 119-year-old centre prepares to add a massive lifestyle and recreation section to its facility.
Brodribb Home, which has been a Toowoomba institution since 1898, lodged plans with the Toowoomba Regional Council this week to demolish two of its oldest wings in favour of a two-storey extension.
Brodribb CEO Pam Chipperfield (centre) shows residents (left) Lyn Ferguson and May Hass plans for Brodribb’s $5 million expansion. Kevin Farmer
If approved, the new ""Maple Wing"" would feature a new multi-function centre, diversional therapy, staff amenities, chapel, cinema, beauty salon, gym, library and electrical services.
Ms Chipperfield, who has been in the head role for 38 years, said it was part of the charity organisation's plan to appeal to the next generation of retirees.
""We're knocking down the two oldest wings and building something that Toowoomba will not have seen before,"" she said.
""Having been here so long, we've always changed to know what that incoming generation is looking for.
""This baby boomer generation is used to eating out and having fun.
""It's essential that people don't come and get told, 'here's your room'.""

Ms Chipperfield said the extension was the latest part of a massive redevelopment that started nine years ago.
""This is coming down the home straight,"" she said.
""It's been a lot of planning, we've done new wings, redone old wings and this is the central area that brings it all together.""

I was born in Mackay, grew up there and raised my children there.
It was a great place and I loved every minute of my time there.
But that was 30 plus years ago.
Mackay, sadly, is not the glamorous, prosperous city portrayed by its civic leaders in the Daily Mercury.
It is easy to understand their desperation to secure a new industry.
The city is in a slump - as anyone who has invested in a rental property there can attest. Conversely, look at Toowoomba.

Toowoomba has its own university with graduates rating the highest for starting salaries.
We have a $500 million CBD shopping centre redevelopment that has brought capital city shopping here.
We started the First Coat public art festival - recognised nationally.
We have Australia's newest and most modern airport - Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport - connecting us to the world.
A major $1.6 billion infrastructure project - the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing - is scheduled to be finished next year.
We are part of the massive inland rail project.
We have three major hospitals and a huge number of medical specialists in town.
Our schools - private and public - are the equal of any in Australia.
Sport - we have punched above our weight for decades.
Think where Johnathan Thurston started his career. Think NRL games played here. Think national champions in so many areas. Think Will Power. Think Tim Horan. Think Shane Webcke. Think Queensland PGA championship and the Hutchinson Builders Tennis International.
Our housing is affordable and available now ($350,000 still buys you a very nice four-bedroom home).
Our business leaders are innovative and future looking - with 90 leaders returning from an AccessNZ trip to scout business opportunities. This followed on from a vastly successful AccessChina trip in 2016.
And our business leaders back us with their money.
John Wagner has committed $55 million for infrastructure for the academy. I've heard nothing but crickets from Mackay's business community.
So Mackay, thanks for the memories.
But Toowoomba is the future - for so many reasons.

"OUTLOOK: The Maranoa Regional Council is developing a new strategy that promotes its existing, and emerging attractions.
OUTLOOK: The Maranoa Regional Council is developing a new strategy that promotes its existing, and emerging attractions. Contributed
TRAVELLING across the Tasman, Ed Sims was on a mission to learn from the Land of the Long White Cloud and how it went from being two lonely islands to a global tourism powerhouse.
As Economic and Community Development manager for the Maranoa Regional Council, which oversees cultural and sporting portfolios, grant applications and funding arrangements, Mr Sims is across every element of the region's growth strategies.
And where better to turn to than New Zealand and its 100% Pure campaign which for almost two decades has transformed the country's profile in an award-winning and successful way.
It uniquely promotes New Zealand as both a destination and experience, plays to the country's strengths in agriculture and innovation while paying homage to its traditional owners and heritage.
""Over the past two years, we've been redeveloping our strategies for both tourism and agriculture value-adding, and development of our industry,” Mr Sims said.
""Agriculture is our mainstay in the Maranoa and always has been, always will be.
""The resource sector looks after itself (and) tourism is the major opportunity for us.
""We haven't done it well.”
Each Maranoa Regional Council town is set for a marketing overhaul in a sort of hub and spoke arrangement in the region.
While Roma will continue to be the region's ""capital” or main centre, its surrounding towns will feed off it, drawing visitors in for different experiences unique to them and the region.
Mr Sims was inspired by the Toowoomba and Surat Basin Enterprise's Access New Zealand trade mission which included a conference in Auckland in June.
""At the conference what we heard from a whole bunch of speakers was branding - finding something unique that you can sustain,” he said.
""We're doing the same things in the Maranoa with the strengths of the hub and spoke tourism arrangement where you attracted tourists or visitors to the major centre and equip visitor information centres and major businesses with what they need.”
If all goes to plan, it will mean visitors to Cobb & Co Changing Station Museum and an Aboriginal Interpretive Shelter at Surat, tourists to the Heritage Complex and Railway Station at Wallumbilla, and tours of the infamous Kenniff Courthouse and Arrest Creek Monuments at Mitchell or understanding of the coal seam gas sector and its operations at the Big Rig at Roma.
Each offers an experience at its own destination, Mr Sims said.
""We are going through a re-branding exercise,” Mr Sims said.
Simultaneously, the council will also be trying to boost the region's agricultural production with a particular focus on reinvigorating the sheep industry, possibly emulating the success of New Zealand's dairy farm co-operative.
Fonterra is renowned for its 10,500 dairy farming members and owners which have the collective buying and production power to drive the industry and keep it viable, sustainable and productive.
In the Maranoa region once known for its sheep and shearing industry, the business model could deliver huge benefits to the beleaguered sector.
Wild dog exclusion fencing, he said, could see the wool industry return to the region, bringing with it shearing gangs and, ultimately, the revival of a bygone era.
""We need to capitalise on what we have,” Mr Sims said.
Plans are due to be lodged before the council by the end of the year with the strategy developed in consultation with the towns and community.

RUGBY LEAGUE: St Mary's College has progressed through to the final four of the Confraternity Shield after defeating Aquinas College 36-4 in Tuesday's quarter final at Charters Towers.
St Mary's was never headed en route to the comfortable victory, as they enjoyed a day off yesterday after playing in four games on the opening two days of the carnival.
It continues a dream run towards glory after sweeping through their pool matches without defeat.
They will now come up against Ignatius Park College after the Townsville school edged past Rockhampton Grammar 20-18.
Like St Mary's, Ignatius Park is undefeated throughout their four games to date.
The semi final will be live streamed on the QISSRL Facebook page, and will start at 3pm with a spot in tomorrow's final on the line.
NETBALL: St Ursula's claimed bragging rights over Downlands on day three of the QISS netball tournament in Townsville to book their spot in the quarter finals.
Downlands needed a victory to claim top spot in Pool C, but were ultimately unable to get the job done, as St Ursula's caused the 21-18 upset, snatching fourth place in the process.
Both teams will now battle it out today in the division three quarter finals as they aim to make the final.

"SEVERAL people have written in to air their discontent at the Mcdonalds' outlets encouraging customers to use the automated ordering system.
I absolutely refuse to use the automated system as by doing so, I am taking away someone's job.
That of course is the mission of management. They cut jobs by installing automated machines. The big banks are the same. It is appalling.
Every time I venture into any banking institution, I am encouraged by ""the greeter"" to use the ATM machines.

Yes, it would be nice not having to wait in a line up but no, no, no, I will not stand out on the side walk of Ruthven St to deposit or withdraw cash - fully exposed to all and sundry within grabbing distance.
""Oh"" says the bank ""We have installed the machines so our customers have a choice when they do their banking"". What utter nonsense.
People have always managed to get to their bank within business hours. Obviously no thought has been given by the bank's ""planners"" as to the safety of their customers when they are using the street machines.
Banks rarely do anything for the benefit and convenience of their customers. Everything is geared to the bank's convenience and their ultimate profits.
I hope that everyone will refuse to use the automated systems and perhaps then these ""big guns"" will think twice about what and what does not, constitute customer service.
But more importantly, what they should be doing to preserve the jobs of their employees.

"THE Toowoomba Golf Club is facing a community backlash against its plan to build a 78-unit retirement village in the heart of Middle Ridge.
Ahead of its impending decision on the $30 million facility, the Toowoomba Regional Council has received submissions from at least 17 residents against the proposal, including a petition.
Lead petitioners Tony and Mandy Mott wrote that the facility, a joint venture between the club and three other developers, was a ""dramatic"" change of use compared with the rest of Middle Ridge.
""We understand that the golf club has to make some changes to remain viable, (but) we believe there are other options which could be contained with the golf course area that would have a lot less negative impact on the surrounding area,"" they wrote.
A second petition has been circulating across the neighbourhood, which outlined issues with the scale of it and impacts on vegetation and transport.
Check out the Spring-Ramsay Sts detention basin: Middle Ridge resident Leona McIntyre talks about the look of the Spring-Ramsay Sts detention basin.
""The size and scale of this development is not permitted in Middle Ridge under the current Toowoomba planning scheme,"" the letter wrote.
""However, council and developers are determined to push this development through regardless.
""It will set a precedent for developers and open the rest of Middle Ridge, including rural residential areas, to be developed for large scale, multi-storey residential developments.""

Golf club general manager Johnathon Zirkler said he respected the views of the opposing residents, but denied the proposed facility would have negative impacts on transport.
""There is always going to be concern, (but) it might be that they don't have as much researched information,"" he said.
""With the development going ahead, it will be keeping with the character of the neighbourhood.""
""They will be over-50s, so they're much more relaxed than families.""

BURN TO SHINE: Dallas Blacklaw (pictured with wife Catrina) will cycle 521km to raise money for DV. John McCutcheon
FOR fitness fanatic Dallas Blacklaw, 521km on a cycle was his idea of a fun time.
When he realised he could raise money for a worthy charity in his effort, he was all in.
Over the course of four days, the personal trainer and keen cyclist will compete in the Velothon Sunshine Coast and the Noosa Classic, in the hope of raising $1521 for Guy Sebastian's charity, The Sebastian Foundation.
The Yaroomba resident's campaign is Burn 2 Shine: Cycle Conscious, named after his personal training business and the singer's most recent album, Conscious.
The campaign is his first fitness fundraiser, but he and his wife Catrina felt a calling to help those less fortunate.
""I couldn't tell you why exactly we're doing it, it's just something we had to do,” he said.
Mr Blacklaw will cycle the events, and his wife has been identifying domestic violence shelters on the Sunshine Coast that The Sebastian Foundation would be able to help.
""They [The Sebastian Foundation] do some really good work for people looking to transfer accommodation after DV relationships,” he said.
""Their work is about making it a little more liveable and comfortable.”
The trainer knew people who had been through violent relationships and come out the other side, so he wanted to bring aware- ness to the taboo issue.
""It was a cause that was close to my heart,” he said.
He has a profound love of fitness, ranging from his work with Les Mills studios in New Zealand to his own personal training businesses, and cycling is just the cherry on top.
""I stay relatively active in my day-to-day work so I won't be racing in the events,” he said.
""I'm just doing it in my own time and enjoying it as much as I can.”
Mr Blacklaw believed keeping fit was rewarding in more ways than physical. He noticed the mental benefits, in particular, were unlike anything else.
""I think movement in general is the most underutilised medicine in world,” he said.
""If people got to move more, if people knew how good exercise felt then we would have an epidemic.”
The Velothon is later this month, and the Noosa Classic is in August.

""TOUGHEN up princess,” ""harden the f--- up”, ""just be a man”.
It's lingo that's heard on any given construction site, pub or sporting club around the country, men talking to other men.
Rarely are real-life questions around one's mental health raised. Even in 2018, some men don't feel comfortable talking about themselves and their problems.
If Caloundra's Blase Grinner had his way, the conversations like this would be eradicated.
BlokesVenture: Blase Grinner's company BlokesVenture takes 12 men into the wilderness for one and three days trips to climb mountains, hike, kayak and more.
""Men are always so busy providing for the family, or focused on their own career or friends, they forget about themselves,” Mr Grinner said.
""There is a massive, macho masculine ego issue with tradies especially. Not being okay is not okay.”
It was a similar situation he found himself in not too long ago.
Working as a foreman he'd hear his alarm ring and immediately have the feeling of dread wash over him.
He worked only to pay the bills.

Unsatisfied, he knew he wanted to help people, but first he had to help himself, before allowing his vision to come to life two years ago.
The 34-year-old has started a monthly men's meet-up program called BlokesVenture.
He takes 12 men into the wilderness for one and three days trips to climb mountains, hike, kayak and more.
They do traditional manly activities but, importantly, get the conversation started on the tougher questions.
""A question I like to start off is to ask the guys for one thing that they love about themselves; it takes them out of their comfort zone,” Mr Grinner said.
""We still have that tall poppy syndrome, where if we share from our heart we get chopped down.
""The things we talk about stay within the group, nothing is shared. I wish every man could feel his own greatness.”

Mr Grinner was just 22 when suicide touched him. Someone close to him was inches away from ending it all and didn't feel safe talking about the issues.
Since then, he's had several footy mates take their own lives.
He says BlokesVenture is gaining rapid traction, and it's not just men making inquiries about it.
""The people who reach out to me often are also women,” he said.
""They're thanking me for providing this space. Women supporting their husbands who won't talk about it, or feel too ashamed.

"Damian Bathersby reckons it's funny that John Butler might have some competition in the Bathersby home.
Damian Bathersby reckons it's funny that John Butler might have some competition in the Bathersby home. Lyn McCarthy
THERE was great excitement at our place this week when they announced that John Butler would be playing at the Caloundra Music Festival.
Actually, they may have announced it a while back and I may have been keeping it quiet.
Because you know what that means, don't you?
It means I'll be spending at least one day of the music festival without my wife.
Based on previous experience with her fixation on Mr John Butler Esquire, our day will go something like this ...
She'll insist we get to the festival venue long before the gates open - maybe 4am.
And we'll have to be sober.
Once we get in, she'll race to the stage and position herself in the prime spot, front and centre, where she'll happily stand for 10 hours enduring bands she's never heard of and music she hates.
She'll be jostled by teenagers and drunks, forgo such niceties as food and toilet breaks and, worst of all, share her personal space with hipsters.
Standing in the front row of a venue waiting for John Butler concert is the only time I've ever seen her put up with the inane chatter of 15-year-olds without saying something sarcastic or tripping them.
But none of that will matter when the great man finally comes on stage and she'll stand transfixed, hanging on his every word and riff.
And when the last notes have died away and the crowd's attention has moved on, she'll rush back to me with a grin a mile wide and announce ""he smiled at me!”.
Followed by ""I'll bet he smells like patchouli and dope”.
Then she'll demand a bourbon and details on the quickest path to the toilets.
Now the last time this happened, I was foolish enough to suggest that JB (as she likes to call him) smiles at everyone when he's on stage.
It's his job, after all, and the lights shining in his eyes mean that all he can see is glare.
And that even if he could see faces in the crowd, he's not opposed to the occasional spliff and would probably smile at just about anything - even one of those funny cat videos she's so keen of watching online.
But I won't say that this year.
No, this year I will take her in my arms, kiss her tenderly and say ""that's so cool, my baby”.
Then I'll buy her a bourbon and show her where the nearest toilets are.
Because that's the sort of bloke I am.
And also because I think Mr John Butler might have a bit of competition in the idol stakes.
Why do I say that?
Well, she was listening to a Rob Thomas song the other day and halfway through it she turned to me and said ""can you please breath a bit softer when I'm listening to Rob? Honestly, I can barely hear him over you inhaling end exhaling.
""Surely you can hold your breath for three or four minutes.”
So if Rob Thomas ever comes to Caloundra Music Festival, we're in trouble.
You hear me, Mr Johnny Butler?
You and I have some serious competition.
I'm used to it but I bet you don't hear it every day.",www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au,2018-07-05 05:00:00,30,428029

Sunshine Coast Council has proposed planning scheme amendments to rezone a large parcel of rural land in Yandina for residential purposes. Contributed
HUNDREDS of new homes on a Coast town's outskirts are a gut-wrenching prospect for Linda Whittington as she fights to maintain her rural outlook.
Sunshine Coast Council's rezoning plans prompted a community meeting in Yandina on Tuesday night where Mrs Whittington and others voiced their concerns.
The council has proposed planning scheme amendments to make three large rural-zoned lots into emerging community zones.
Those lots make up the vast majority of a 35ha parcel on the town's south-west fringe.
Mrs Whittington's home of the past 29 years adjoins one of those blocks, with hers and her neighbours' rural-zoned lots proposed to be changed to low-density residential.
She fears the clear view over her back fence could fill with two-storey homes on blocks as small as 300sq m.
""If we wanted to live in a community where we could reach out and touch our neighbours' roofs we would have moved to Nambour or something,” Mrs Whittington said.
""It's gut-wrenching.”
Yandina residents attend a meeting about Sunshine Coast Council's plans to rezone a large parcel of land for residential purposes. Contributed
She said she would rather the land be purchased by the council to be an environmental reserve.
But she said she thought the council was much more likely to opt for residential development.
""I'd be very surprised if it comes out as anything other than an emerging community zone.”
Wappa Falls Rd resident Cindy Lidington, who was also at the meeting, said she always expected the former cane growing land would be subdivided, but didn't expect small blocks would be a possibility.
Mrs Lidington said she hoped any development would bring better access for pedestrians and cyclists between the area and town as well as to Wappa Falls.
She said she only found out about the plans three weeks ago and called for better communication to residents.
""Have the conversation with the residents of the town because we are the ones who live here,” Mrs Lidington said.
Yandina resident John Mason also attended the meeting, saying an increase in traffic and lack of road infrastructure were high on his list of concerns.
He was also critical of the language used in council documents to explain the changes and the way in which they were displayed on its website.
""It's all bureaucratic double talk so nobody can find it,” Mr Mason said.
""To me it is pretty clear they wanted to hide it.”
Reference to the changes was advertised in the Daily by the council last month, mentioning Yandina as one of nine areas where amendments were being considered.
On the council's website, the changes were detailed under a heading Proposed Sunshine Coast Planning Scheme Amendment- Site Specific (Including South East Regional Plan Bring Forward Sites) and Operational Matters.
Cr Greg Rogerson, who attended the meeting with council planning officers, said he was surprised by the amount of people there.
One attendee said the crowd reached 90 people.
""It was bigger than I expected,” Cr Rogerson said.
He said the block of former farmland had ""no vegetation on it” and was within half a kilometre of Yandina.
""Unashamedly I said to to them... when we looked at this particular block... it really stood out for residential.”
He noted its inclusion in the urban footprint after a review of the State Government's South East Queensland Regional Plan 2017.
Cr Rogerson said residents would have a chance to have input in a masterplanned development under the emerging community zoning whereas they wouldn't have if it was zoned low-density residential.
""This way, everything is impact assessable.”
He urged residents to ask for a buffer and to ask for lower density near their boundaries, noting the development would be a mix of smaller and larger blocks.
""They certainly won't be 300sq m blocks.”
Cr Rogerson said people who were in favour of the rezoning approached him after the meeting.
He said the potential for more business, more parks and playgrounds and better infrastructure were among their reasons for supporting it.",www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au,2018-07-05 05:00:00,29,428013
"WITH a bit of fire, food and fun, the Sunshine Coast Rotary Community Corps is helping destitute Afrikaans families living in squatter camps in South Africa.
The group is hosting a camp oven cook-off competition this Saturday, with all money raised going towards the purchase of products to help the Afrikaans' families.
Corps member Charmaine Wheatley, who was born in South Africa, said she had seen just how tough the conditions were.
""Because these people only speak Afrikaans, they can't get jobs due to the political environment and they have lost their homes and have ended up living in these camps on the streets,” she said.
Ms Wheatley said this was the second year the cook-off had been held and organisers were hoping to make this year's event even better to be able to take more supplies.
""We supply the fire and people pay $20 to enter the comp and they cook the dishes all day and, at the end, we plate them up and people can buy them for $15,” she said.
""All the money raised goes to help the Afrikaans people.
""It will be a fun day with live entertainment on offer as well.”
A panel of judges will select the winners and, thanks to some Coast businesses, there are great prizes to be won.
The cook-off will be held at Crunch 2/354 Mons Rd, Forest Glen.
Entries to cook must be made by Friday, July 6.

"Police divers search the river near the Woodburn Memorial Hall for a missing man.
Police divers search the river near the Woodburn Memorial Hall for a missing man. Marc Stapelberg
PROSECUTORS won't pursue more serious charges against a man accused of assaulting his drunk friend on the banks of the Richmond River, moments before the friend rolled into the water and drowned.
Luke James Mote, 43, will also fight the police charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm levelled against him in the wake of the tragic June 12 incident at Woodburn, in which homeless man Robert Doyle lost his life.
Mote faced Lismore Local Court on Tuesday, where his solicitor Rachel Thomas entered a not guilty plea to the assault charge.
Wearing a charcoal hoodie and matching tracksuit pants and trainers, Mote was supported by two loved ones in the public gallery.
He has been granted bail since his last court appearance, despite being initially refused bail by a magistrate on June 13.
Police prosecutor Brett Gradisnik told the court he had asked the matter to be adjourned on the last occasion for referral to the DPP in case more serious charges were filed.
However, he said there was ""no election by the Director"" in relation to the matter.
The court has previously heard that Mote and Mr Doyle, 45, were sleeping rough behind the Woodburn Community Hall on June 12.
Mote allegedly told police he had prodded his sleeping and intoxicated friend with his foot twice and attempted to move him away from the river with a ""monkey grip"" when the men both rolled into the water.
Mr Doyle never resurfaced, and his body was found by police divers on the morning of June 14.
After Mr Doyle fell in, Mote rushed to a nearby service station to raise the alarm saying his friend had fallen into the river without his involvement.
But he allegedly later admitted to police that he had tried to move Doyle away from the river edge by kicking him twice to wake him up and then gripping his hands.
He was subsequently charged with assault prior to Mr Doyle's body being located.
Police have since conducted detailed forensic analysis of the evidence and there was no suggestion in court on Tuesday of any evidence that contradicted Mote's story.
Sgt Gradisnik also did not object to the lifting of all conditions on Mote's bail status, making it unconditional.
Magistrate Annette Sinclair ordered the brief of evidence be served on July 31 and adjourned the matter until August 10.",www.northernstar.com.au,2018-07-05 05:00:00,18,150862

TWO men were locked-up for arriving to court 75 minutes and two-hours late in a move labelled by a magistrate as ""outrageous"" and ""over-the-top"".
Dylan Shae Poulton faced Maroochydore Magistrates Court yesterday from the watchhouse where he'd spent almost 24 hours behind bars.
The court heard he'd arrived to the Noosa Court House at 11.30am instead of 9am the day before, prompting a warrant to be issued for his arrest.
Poulton waited in the foyer of the police station for two hours while officers retrieved the warrant from the court so they could arrest him.
Magistrate Matthew McLaughlin discharged Poulton and apologised.
Poulton went on to plead guilty to a number of other charges he was facing, including possess dangerous drugs and possess drug utensils and not-guilty to seven charges which will go to hearing at a later date.
Mr McLaughlin warned Poulton to arrive on time for his next court appearance.
""It's not a public bar you're going to, it's court.
""Court starts at 9am, you need to be here at 9am.""
Matthew Gerard Furner, 29, was also behind bars after arriving to court in Noosa late on the same day.
His lawyer told the Maroochydore Magistrates Court yesterday his client was late because his daughter's kindergarten bus didn't show up.
Furner had called the courthouse at 9.40am and told them he would be there by 10.10am - when he was five minutes later than expected a warrant was issued.
Mr McLaughlin also discharged Furner on the one charge of failing to appear.
Furner then pleaded guilty to fraud and receiving tainted property after he bought a $100 Bunnings gift card which had been stolen from a car in Golden Beach in May.
On June 5, Furner used the card to buy plumbing equipment.
Mr McLaughlin ordered Furner serve 14 days in prison, with immediate parole eligibility.

Damage done to marine plants at Scooter Farms in Maroochy River. Contributed
THE Minister for Fisheries has praised the tough penalty imposed on a Sunshine Coast company that destroyed 620sq m of marine plants in an indigenously significant area.
Scooter Farms, adjacent to Boggy Creek on River Rd, Maroochy River, was fined more than $29,000 after the director Scott Dwan ordered building materials dumped on the site to be covered in soil.
As a result, common reed and rusty sedge were killed in the area which plays a part in the Maroochy River Dreamtime story.
Minister for Agricultural Industry Development and Fisheries Mark Furner said the fines imposed sent a clear message that the wilful damage of marine plants and the rights of traditional owners would not be tolerated.
""Queensland is blessed with a highly diverse range of marine plant species and a rich indigenous cultural heritage neither of which should be taken for granted or abused.
""Effectively managing and protecting all marine plants is vital in ensuring sustainable fish habitats and fisheries production whilst preserving precious links to ancient stories and traditions helps maintain indigenous cultural identity for future generations.""",www.news-mail.com.au,2018-07-05 05:00:00,8,86772

""The man will face court next month.""
Sen-Const Graham said police made it a priority to patrol all beaches in general, but patrols of the Mon Repos specifically had increased over the past week.
""He obviously didn't read the NewsMail article because he was caught just a few days after the story appeared in the paper,"" he said.
Last week the NewsMail published the story of reporter Tahlia Stehbens' uncomfortable experience at the beach.
Senior Constable Nigel Schultz said people had historically been charged with offences committed along the Mon Repos strip with people sometimes behaving inappropriately.
""It happens mostly away from the walking tracks, in the bushland area,"" Sen-Const Schultz said.
""Unfortunately, some websites give false information about it being a meeting point.
""The Mon Repos area is patrolled daily down Moores Rd and we do motorbike patrols through the bike path.
""We also walk through the bushland behind and check licence plates of cars to ensure they aren't wanted for anything.""

LIFE-LONG LOVE: Stanley and Eole Hoptin will celebrate their 65th year of marriage on July 4. TAHLIA STEHBENS
THEY say opposites attract, and for Stanley and Eole Hoptin, it couldn't ring more true.
The couple celebrated 65 years of marriage yesterday, and while the two can't remember what initially drew them together, they're both glad it happened.
Stanley always knew he wanted an Italian girl, and Eole had been told never to marry her own kind.
""My brother always used to say 'Eole, never marry an Italian, you'll be out in the field all day',” she recalls.
""Funny thing, I married an Australian, and what happened? I was out in the field all day!”
The country couple met through Stanley's sister, who Eole was close with.
""We were at the pictures one night, up in Gin Gin at the open-air theatre, and I didn't know he was there,” Eole said.
""Just at the end of it he came down and said 'Can I see you for a minute?'.
""He said 'Well, will you go with me?' and I said 'Are you barmy?'
""And he never spoke to me for about two years, and I can't blame him. But here we are 65 years later.”
Eole was 17 when they married and Stanley was just a week off his 23rd birthday.
""We had nine months of dating and nine months engaged, getting to know one another,” Eole said.
""We had two children, who then went on to have five children between them, and now we have 14 great-grandchildren.”
The pair worked their backs to the bone running cane farms in both Cloyne and McIlwraith and finally retired to Bundaberg in 1980.
""Hard work don't kill nobody, and that's what it's been,” Stanley said.
""I had done my back in - it was either get off the farm or end up in a wheelchair.
""At the time, money and prices were good, so we got off.”
With rest and therapy Stanley was able to mend his back almost completely, but they both still face their own challenges.
""He's spent the past two Christmas' in hospital with (angina),” Eole said.
""Last time the doctor said, 'We'll book you in now for this Christmas then?' but you've got to have a sense of humour.”
A lifetime later, the two are able to sit and reflect on their relationship and the little things, such as local dances, fishing trips and band groups that have made their story whole.
""Friendship is the most important part of a relationship,” they said.
""And if there's troubles, talk it out. Sort it out that way, don't bottle it up.
""It wasn't easy let me tell you, because he's a crab and I'm a Capricorn, a goat,” Eole said.

Act Insp Cameron said the officers would also be exposed to crime scenes, detectives, the Bargara station and other special areas like the road policing unit.
""It's important to have the on-the-job training because the first seven months (at police academy) are mostly theory and scenario-based training,"" he said.
""This is the first opportunity that they'll get to put that training into play in a real life situation.""
Originally from the Gold Coast hinterland, first year Constable Cameron Bass said while he was both nervous and excited to start working as an operational police officer, he wanted to be a role model for the younger generations.
""I was fortunate enough when I was younger to know quite a number of police officers and they were always really good role models ... and that inspired me to try and follow in their footsteps and hopefully inspire some other young people eventually as well,"" he said.

"RUDE: Boss-to-be's response to teen after she declined job offer. Facebook
A SHOCKED mother has been left dumbfounded after a business owner sent her daughter a harsh and degrading text message.
Peta Burrows spent last Wednesday driving her 16-year-old daughter Brianne around town in the hopes of finding her a part-time job.
She told the NewsMail Brianne was all smiles when she returned to the car after handing in her resume to a local business owner.
""(The business owner) sat her down and gave her the job right then and there,"" Mrs Burrows said.
""She was obviously over the moon that she'd gotten the job, especially as it was the first place she handed her resume in to.
""She texted a couple of her friends to tell them because she was so excited, and that's when all the messages started flooding in, telling her not to work at (that business).""
Mrs Burrows said after hearing from a number of people that her daughter would be better off not taking the job, she and Brianne decided to decline the offer.
""But she forgot to send it and ended up only telling him really late the night before,"" she said.
""Fair enough, she left it too late, we both know and acknowledge that, and she did apologise for that, but when we got his reply message I was shocked.""
In his response to Brianne, the business owner made a slur at the young teenager and called her out for messaging him so late at night. It read: ""You little b--tch messaging me at this hour you and family are nothing and hope you find nothing.
Mrs Burrows said she was left speechless by the rude text.

"Why the Chronicle and the Daily Mercury are trading jabs Tobi Loftus Full Profile Login to follow
A RIVALRY between Toowoomba and Mackay has started to emerge with the announcement the two cities had been short-listed as possible locations for a Qantas Pilot Training Academy.
On Monday Qantas representatives met with Toowoomba Mayor Paul Antonio, Wellcamp Airport's John Wagner and State Development Minister Cameron Dick to take a closer look at Toowoomba's bid for the facility.
At a press conference before the tour, Toowoomba Mayor Paul Antonio was asked whether there was any rivalry between the two cities over the proposals.
""I know (Mackay Mayor Greg Williamson) and respect him highly,"" Mr Antonio said.
""But on this particular subject... I really think that when you look at things, have a look at Toowoomba, then have a look at Mackay.
""I'll rest my case there.""
The next day The Chronicle ran 'Memo to Qantas: Choose Toowoomba over Mackay' on its front page and the Daily Mercury was not happy.
Yesterday, Toowoomb-nahh mate was splashed on the Mackay tabloid's front page, along with a cartoon showing a plane labelled Mackay shooting down a plane labelled Toowoomba.
The story featured quotes from a number of prominent Mackay residents, including controversial Dawson MP George Christensen.
""I've been once and it was cold enough that day to not make the mistake again,"" Mr Christensen said.
""If they want to have to be push starting the planes down the runways because the fuel pipes have been frozen, then Toowoomba is the right choice.""
Whitsunday MP Jason Costigan also took aim at The Chronicle's editor Steve Etwell.
""Don't get me wrong, I love the Darling Downs. Great people, love the Carnival of Flowers,"" Mr Costigan said.
""However, in terms of climate and lifestyle, Mackay in the tropical north is a no brainer.
""I think deep down, even the editor of The Chronicle knows that. After all, he comes from the same place as me, the city that I represent, a city which has put a strong case forward to bring the Flying Kangaroo to town.""
Toowoomba's bid for the pilot training academy was one of nine proposals short-listed across the country.
The other eight locations, including Mackay, are Alice Springs, Bendigo, Busselton, Dubbo, Launceston, Tamworth and Wagga Wagga.
Wagners director John Wagner said the company was prepared to invest heavily in the training facility.
""Wagners are prepared to put in significant infrastructure, to the tune of $55 million, to make this thing a reality,"" he said.
""The single biggest thing we bring to the table is we are not capital constrained, we make decisions quickly.

"A Syrian rebel fighter aims his Kalashnikov assault rifle near the frontline outside the southern city of Daraa on July 3, 2018
By Layal Abou Rahal
Syrian rebels were facing a deadline Wednesday in negotiations with regime ally Russia to either agree to tough surrender terms in the south or come under a renewed military onslaught.
Moscow has been backing a two-week offensive by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces against rebels in the southern provinces of Daraa and Quneitra.
But it is simultaneously brokering talks with rebel towns for negotiated surrenders in a carrot-and-stick strategy that Russia and the regime have successfully used in the past.
More than 30 towns have already agreed to return to regime control and talks were focused on remaining rebel territory in Daraa's western countryside and the southern half of the city.
Rebels were set to meet with a Russian delegation on Wednesday afternoon to deliver their decision on Moscow's proposal for a regime takeover of the rest of the south, a spokesman for the opposition's southern operations said.
Ibrahim Jabbawi told AFP that rebels were ""now discussing its content with key figures and fighters in the south on whether to return to the negotiating table.""
""We hope to reach an agreement so that the displaced can return home and the fighting can stop,"" Jabbawi said.
A source close to the talks said the meeting would take place at 4:00 pm local time (1300 GMT). It follows a tense hours-long meeting on Tuesday.
In that session, rebels proposed a ceasefire, the army's withdrawal from towns it had already taken, and safe passage to opposition territory elsewhere for fighters or civilians refusing to live under regime control.
But Moscow roundly rejected the terms, the source said, and responded with a counter-proposal. It told negotiators that population transfers were not on the table in the south, although it had agreed to them in other areas like Eastern Ghouta and Aleppo.
Russia insisted the army would return to its pre-2011 positions, and local police would take over towns in coordination with Russian military police.
The Russian delegation warned opposition factions that Wednesday ""would be their last day to negotiate, and that they'd have to submit their final answer in the afternoon meeting,"" the source said.
Moscow has used tough deadlines in the past with rebel negotiators but has extended them at times. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, air strikes had stopped for several days to allow for negotiations.
""Today will be the last round -- either the rebels agree to these terms, or the military operations resume,"" the source said.
That blend of military pressure and negotiated surrenders has expanded the regime's control of Daraa province to around 60 percent -- double what it held when it began operations on June 19.
The violence has displaced between 270,000 and 330,000 people, according to the U.N., many south to the border with Jordan or west near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
Both countries have kept their borders closed to those fleeing the violence, despite mounting calls by rights groups to let Syrians escape to safety.
On Wednesday, Human Rights Watch demanded both Jordan and Israel allow asylum-seekers in.
""The abject refusal by Jordanian authorities to allow asylum seekers to seek protection not only goes against their international legal obligations, but against basic human decency,"" said HRW's Lama Fakih.
Some displaced families whose hometowns had fallen back under regime control have been returning, but even that journey is dangerous.
Eleven members of a single family were killed overnight in a land mine blast as they returned to their hometown of Al-Mseifra, which had ""reconciled"" with the government, the Observatory said Wednesday. That brought the number of civilians killed since the offensive began to more than 140, including children.
World powers have criticised the operation for violating a ceasefire announced last year by Washington, Amman and Moscow, but they have not managed to halt the blitz. The United Nations Security Council will hold a closed-door emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the offensive.
Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi was in Moscow on Wednesday for talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Safadi called for a ceasefire in the south, saying the developing situation was of ""great importance"" to Jordan.
Lavrov, meanwhile, said Moscow was hoping rebels would lay down their weapons.
""We are helping the Syrian army carry out its work with the armed groups, to convince them to sign a reconciliation agreement, drop their arms, and resume a peaceful life,"" he said.

"Why some Nationals want Tony Abbott to stay in the dark on the National Energy Guarantee
Posted
In his latest attempt to skewer the Federal Government's energy policy, Tony Abbott has attached himself to the National Party's push for government-owned and funded coal-fired power stations.
The Nationals are not convinced the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) will reduce power prices as much as they would like, and they have a proposal for the Prime Minister, which includes building new power stations and funding existing traditional ones.
Mr Abbott has declared he thinks that sort of deal would make the NEG, which he dislikes intensely, ""much more supportable"".
He stressed on 2GB radio yesterday he wanted to see the policy, not the party leadership, changed.
But anyone who remembers the events of the Liberal leadership spill in 2009 could be forgiven for doubting his motives.
Nine years ago, Mr Abbott and the Nationals were in lock-step to ensure Malcolm Turnbull, then the opposition leader, lost his job because of his support for Labor's emissions trading scheme.
The issue boiled over in the Coalition and Mr Turnbull lost the leadership by one vote in a partyroom spill.
The ousted Mr Turnbull then forlornly crossed the floor to vote with the Rudd government.
Now the Nationals find themselves again embroiled in a pivotal energy debate involving Mr Turnbull and his prime ministerial predecessor, Mr Abbott.
This time, it is about the National Energy Guarantee, the Government's push to tweak the market to ensure supply and reliability while also meeting our Paris climate commitments.
But most Nationals say this time it is not about ""rolling Turnbull"" or ""tearing apart the Government"".
In fact, a number of them would rather Mr Abbott retreat and quieten down.
They worry he has politicised an important policy debate by muddying it with questions about leadership.
As one Nationals MP told the ABC: ""Tony probably wants it to be like the ETS. That is not where we're coming from. He decided he's onto a winner. But he doesn't have our support. It's really a waste of time.
""No-one wants to tear down the Government.""
Nationals' plan to cut prices a free marketer's nightmare
The Nationals are not convinced the NEG will go far enough to reduce people's power bills and that is a big concern for the party, given its base is in rural and often-poorer areas.
Mr Abbott's latest intervention has drawn greater attention to what some Nationals have been working quietly on behind the scenes — a proposal which they strongly believe will address concerns about energy affordability.
But their ideas come with a multi-billion-dollar price tag and a radical, government-ownership model.
Queensland National Keith Pitt, a former electrical engineer, was warning of an energy crisis long before it became a frequently used term in today's politics.
He wrote the 'working document' Nationals leader Michael McCormack is discussing with the Prime Minister.
It proposes a $1 billion grant fund to encourage state governments and business to keep existing traditional power stations open by helping with modernisation.
The Nationals have consistently argued in favour of carbon capture and storage and High Efficiency Low Emissions (HELE) technology, which they describe as 'clean coal'.
Applications would be assessed by the Energy Security Board and the Infrastructure and Project Financing Agency, which falls under Nationals leader Michael McCormack's infrastructure portfolio.
There would need to be proof that keeping a plant open would help provide more electricity into the grid, thus lowering prices.
One example some Nationals have raised is the ageing Liddell power station in the New South Wales Hunter Valley.
The Government has lobbied the company, AGL, to keep it open but to no avail.
But the bigger prize Nationals have their hopes hung up on is a $4 billion equity fund, which would see the Government able to build new coal-fired power stations, off budget.
It would operate in a similar vein to the National Broadband Network and the Inland Rail project. The Government would rely on the coal plant making enough money down the track to cover the overall cost.
But the idea of a government building and owning a coal-fired power station, and intervening in the market, would horrify free-market liberals and respected economists.
The Coalition announced billions more dollars in 'off budget' infrastructure spending this year, and Chris Richardson from Deloitte Access Economics points out there is no guarantee all of the money will be paid back.
""Increasingly, the politicians have been shoving stuff off budget which may not pay its way,"" Mr Richardson said.
""If you're putting something off budget, you're saying it will earn enough to pay the money back into the budget. That's a risk for Inland Rail, for coal, for everything. But it's more of a risk for some things than others.""
Negotiations put alliances and leaders to the test
Energy analysts like Tony Wood from the Grattan Institute have argued building new coal-fired power plants would take so long, the return on investment would kick in too late and prices would not come down.
Discussions on the National Party's draft proposal to the Prime Minister are ongoing and will continue over the parliamentary winter break.
Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg is still talking with the states, who all need to support the NEG before it is put to a vote in Parliament.
The National Party's latest intervention makes Mr Frydenberg's task even more difficult.
He is still trying to connect Nationals backbenchers with industry figures who desperately want a resolution to the energy stalemate. But that is unlikely to sway them.
Some Nationals argue guaranteeing government funding for coal-fired power stations would help win One Nation leader Pauline Hanson's support for the Government's company tax cuts policy.
Senator Hanson has previously said she wants a new coal-fired power station, as well as a crackdown on multinationals who do not pay their fair share of tax.
If the Prime Minister refuses to concede to any of the National Party's requests, party leader Michael McCormack could face his first big test.
Some Nationals could cross the floor to vote against it, or in a more dramatic development Mr McCormack could withdraw that whole party's support.
That could rattle his relationship with the Liberals but the alternative would leave a number of more outspoken Nationals poised to privately or publicly accuse their leader of failing to flex his muscle.
As for Tony Abbott, there is no end to his interventions in sight.

"Sudan, the last northern white rhino, died early this year, but it may not be the end of the line.
Scientists have created hybrid white rhinoceros embryos in the lab using frozen sperm from extinct male northern white rhinoceros.
Rhino teaser Key points This is the first time artificial reproductive technologies have been used to extract eggs from rhinos
The eggs from southern white rhinos have been combined with frozen sperm from northern rhinos to produce hybrid embryos in the lab
The embryos will be implanted in surrogate mothers
It has a long way to go, but scientists hope this technology could eventually be used to save the northern white rhino and other endangered species
Their work is the latest step in an attempt to bring the most endangered mammal on Earth back from the brink.
Only two female northern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) still exist.
The last male northern white rhino, Sudan, died earlier this year.
Global pioneer in reproductive science Thomas Hildebrandt has watched the decline of the subspecies of the iconic animal over the past 20 years.
""I think science can bring back this magnificent creature,"" Professor Hildebrandt said.
""We may need a little bit of luck, but I think what we can demonstrate already is quite impressive.""
Professor Hildebrandt and colleagues have shown for the first time that artificial reproduction techniques can be successfully used to create rhino embryos, they report in the journal Nature Communications.
They have also proven the ability to generate embryonic stem cells, which could potentially produce more eggs and sperm.
Creating embryos using frozen sperm
Artificial reproduction techniques have never been attempted before in the rhino, said study co-author Marilyn Renfree.
""This is the first time it's been done in this species because it's a very large animal and has a particular shape to its reproductive tract,"" Professor Renfree of the University of Melbourne said.
About the size of an SUV, the white rhinoceros is the largest of all rhino species.
There are two subspecies: the almost-extinct northern white rhinoceros, and their cousins the southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum)
Share Southern white rhinoceros will play surrogate mothers to embryos created through artificial reproductive technologies.
Using a specially designed tool, the team harvested eggs from live southern white rhinos and combined them with frozen sperm that had been previously collected from northern white males and stored in sperm banks.
The frozen sperm was a bit sluggish at first, but after zapping it with electricity the team were able to successfully produce early-stage embryos known as blastocysts.
The team also used eggs and sperm from the southern white rhinoceros to create pure embryos.
Three of the early-stage embryos — two hybrid and one pure — have been cryofrozen.
The team plan to implant embryos into southern white rhino females to see if the surrogate mothers can carry a pregnancy to term.
""We have several of these embryos in high quality,"" Professor Hildebrandt said.
The quest to create a northern white rhino baby
While this phase of the work aims to create hybrid calves, the goal of the project is to create a pure northern white rhino calf.
To do this, the team plan to harvest eggs from the last two females —Sudan's daughter Najin and granddaughter Fatu, which live at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Laikipia national park in Kenya.
Share Fatu and Najin graze at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Laikipia national park, Kenya.
""Before we collect the [eggs] … we need proof of concept that the embryo transfer with hybrid embryos is working,"" Professor Hildebrandt said.
It is also unclear at this stage whether or not Najin and Fatu will have viable eggs, he said.
""Nobody has any idea about how they look inside. The younger female is 18, the older female is 26, so we're running out of time.""
If the team can produce a pure white rhino calf they could use the stem cell technology, which they used in this paper, to produce a line of northern white rhino eggs from embryonic stem cells.
""We need one or two northern white rhino female calves, then I think we are all go for sure,"" Professor Hildebrandt said.
Professor Renfree said the work still had a long way to go, but it was a proof of principle.
""This is a stunning result,"" she said.
""I don't know if it'll ever save the northern white rhino … but it certainly is a great step in the right direction.""
Should we bring animals back from near extinction?
While powerful in their scope, using artificial technologies to save near-extinct species, such as the northern white rhinoceros is controversial.
Conservation biologist Guy Castley of the Environmental Futures Research Institute at Griffith University applauded the team's work.
""They've made some big strides in advancing what has been known about artificial reproductive technologies and using IVF potentially to rescue genetic material for a species on the brink of extinction,"" said Dr Castley, who was not involved in the research.
Video Player failed to load. Play Press play then disable your screen reader. Use space bar to pause or play, and up and down arrows to control volume. Use left arrow to rewind and right arrow to fast forward.
But, he said, it does not address the bigger picture issues such as poaching and habitat loss that led to demise of the species in the first place.
""If we were able to secure those rhinos they may end up with a life kept in captivity because there's just no space for them to go in their natural environment.""
It would also take time to build up a viable herd, said Dr Castley, who has worked with the southern white rhino in the past.
""You'd have to have multiple surrogate females and multiple [embryos] that you can then generate an insurance population,"" he said.
""Once that happens, the rhinos would have to get to an age where they would be able to breed, so you're looking at 10 years old.""
With only two live northern white females and sperm from four males available, genetic diversity has been raised as another issue.
But Professor Hildebrandt is optimistic boosting the genetic gene pool could be achieved by using stem cell technology to create eggs from frozen skin cells of 12 different northern white rhinos stored in cell banks around the world.
""It is not just our goal to produce one live northern white rhino — we are now pretty sure we can produce it in the next three years — but we can also produce a wider genetic population.""
The technique, inspired by the work of the 2012 Nobel Prize winners, has been proven to work in mice by Japanese scientist Katsuhiko Hayashi, another member of the team.
""The southern white rhino was nearly extinct at the beginning of the 20th century, there were less than 50 individuals left and now we have more than 20,000,"" Professor Hildebrandt said.
""And their genetic variation is lower than what we have with these 12 samples.""
Last-ditch effort could save other species
Professor Renfree said having low biological diversity was better than not having the animals at all.
""There have been many, many, many attempts to save rhinos by classical conservation methods and they've all failed,"" she pointed out.
""This is the last possible step to save these guys.""
The technology and the techniques developed by the team could also be used to help prevent the extinction of other large animals and related species such as the Sumatran rhino.
Share It is estimated that there are fewer than 100 Sumatran rhinoceros left in the wild.
""If you really want to be successful you start doing it a lot earlier than the last few animals.""
Dr Castley agreed.
""I would hate to see another species go extinct,"" he said.
""We weren't able to take control of the situation and read the signs fast enough to do anything for the northern white rhino … but we might still be able to do something for other threatened species.
""If this research can assist with the progression and the development of novel technologies that can assist with those efforts then we should be using that,"" he said.",www.abc.net.au,2018-07-05 04:50:26,61,570481

PARIS: Italian fashion label Fendi played with textures in its Haute Couture collection in Paris on Wednesday, overlaying see-through bodices with fur trimmings and creating shimmering, scaly skirts.
Elaborate winter coats and dresses in apricot pink and lavendar hues melded together chiffon, mink and other fabrics such as cashmere, to create cascading effects. Some looks included intricate, sequin-filled latticework.

Rome-based Fendi has long been known for its furs, and has continued to put them forward at a time when many other brands are dropping them from collections, under pressure from changing consumer tastes and animal rights campaigners.
Italy's Gucci, owned by Kering one of the fastest-growing labels of recent years, is going fur-free as of this year, and independent fashion house Versace recently said it was following suit.
The Fendi show was octogenerian German designer Karl Lagerfeld's second outing at Haute Couture week in Paris - the season of fashion shows celebrating one-off creations by a select group of houses.
Lagerfeld, who forms a creative duo at Fendi along with the founding family's scion Silvia Venturini Fendi, also presented his latest turn at France's Chanel on Wednesday against an elaborate catwalk backdrop that recreated Parisian street scenes.

SILVERSTONE, England: Four times world champion Lewis Hamilton says Formula One is not worth dying for but he feels 'God has his hand over me' when risking all on the racetrack.
In a podcast interview published by Formula One on Wednesday, the Mercedes driver discussed the strength of his faith - along with a wide selection of topics ranging from his hatred of school and his dyslexia to the frozen sperm and US$700-a-day modelling career of his pet bulldog Roscoe.

Formula One, said the 33-year-old who will be favourite for a fifth British Grand Prix win in a row this weekend, had given him a life and a purpose but had also 'broken' him.
""It's broken me and built me, broken me and built me,"" explained Hamilton.
""When you go through it, you put so much into it, it breaks your heart and kills you when you fail, when you stumble, when everyone’s watching when you stumble,"" he said.
""But when you get back up and when you succeed it lifts you up. You fall and you break a bone, you heal and you keep going. That’s what I mean by it.""

Hamilton, who is Roman Catholic and has a cross tattooed on his back as well as 'family' and 'faith' on his shoulders and a sacred heart on his right bicep, has always been open about finding strength in religion.
""I go with a couple of my close friends, we meet, we go for breakfast and then we go to church together. We leave most often feeling enlightened and empowered. It's like a re-centring,"" he said.
""Sometimes you leave, and you are like 'I didn't get that today', but most of the time you leave and you are like 'Wow, I know where I am going'.""
The most successful British F1 racer, who came from an under-privileged background as the grandson of Caribbean immigrants to debut with McLaren in 2007, said he still loved racing but not at any cost.
""I wouldn’t say F1 is worth dying for,"" he said. ""Your dream, passion, ambition and goals can be worth dying for.""
Hamilton said he was well aware of the dangers of his profession.
""Anything can happen any day, but I feel God has his hand over me,"" he said.
""Nothing is a given and there's nothing that's written that says I am going to live until 100 years old, or that I will live to see my next birthday. I'm just going to make sure I get everything in between now and the next day.""

"Fans watch the 2018 Russia World Cup round of 16 football match between Brazil and Mexico at a China Sports Lottery outlet in Shanghai
By Albee ZHANG
At Xia Lugen's run-down, smoky betting shop in downtown Shanghai, hordes of young men cluster around banks of computers, as betting slips and a huge World Cup chart adorn the walls and a projector beams matches onto a makeshift screen.
China may not have a team at the World Cup in Russia but this has not dampened the enthusiasm of the country's gamblers, with bets in the first three weeks already outstripping the whole of the 2014 tournament in Brazil.
Energetic betting in these technically illegal, but officially sanctioned shops reflects the prevailing attitude towards sports, which are seen as a chance to make money as much as a spectacle to be enjoyed.
Before the first knockout game between France and Argentina, punters -- known as caimin, or ""lottery citizens"", in Chinese -- queued up to place large bets.
Gao Liushun, 55, had previously lost a bundle on Argentina, so doubled down on an Argentinian win because ""I need to win back what I lost, right?"" He lost 1,000 yuan ($150) after France's thrilling 4-3 victory, his heaviest loss of the World Cup so far. Fellow gambler Xia Junmin, a 25-year-old freelancer, lost five times that amount after wagering on a draw.
The World Cup-inspired surge in betting is borne out in the official figures. China has spent 28.6 billion yuan in football betting in the three weeks up to July 1, dwarfing the less than five billion wagered in the three weeks previous to that, according to figures from the China Sports Lottery Management Centre.
This is more than double the roughly 11.5 billion yuan wagered during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and does not take into account underground betting and syndicated gambling, which is widespread in the country.
China's underground gambling networks are often cited as an impetus for match-fixing incidents worldwide, usually in obscure leagues but also in Italy's Serie A and occasionally in World Cup qualifiers.
Although all gambling is technically illegal in China, it is permitted in the country's hundreds and thousands of ""lottery shops"".
These are run by China's Sports Administration with part of the proceeds ploughed back into sport ranging from financing stadiums to training the next generation of Chinese athletes.
However, the government remains vigilant and dozens of unauthorised ""lottery ticket"" apps, which enable punters to place a bet with a single click, were closed down in the first week of the World Cup.
Xia converted his auto dealership into a ""lottery shop"" six years ago and business has boomed during the World Cup, with hundreds of thousands of yuan being bet daily -- more than 10 times the stakes for a normal day. Despite the absence of home interest, the World Cup ""has brought out the passion from people who were not interested in football before"", he told AFP.
""Everyone is watching it. People who didn't bet are all betting now,"" said the 59-year-old Shanghai local, who also has cashiers taking bets over the phone.
Like punters all over the world, many gamblers in China lost a packet during some of the tournament's more surprising results, especially the demise of defending champions Germany, who failed to get out of the group stage for the first time since 1938.
Li Feng, a gambler who has rigged up a big screen at his fried chicken joint to show the games, said he had lost 1,000 yuan betting on Die Mannschaft to beat the unfancied South Koreans in the group stage. But in one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history, South Korea beat the footballing superpower 2-0 with two late goals to break German hearts -- and Li's.
""No sane person would have bet on South Korea to win,"" he complained bitterly.
Gao Liushan, a regular at the bookies, said he was disappointed that China did not make it to the World Cup finals this time around. ""To be frank, China not making it was harmful to us,"" he said. ""But President Xi Jinping said don't forget your first love. The Chinese dream will be realised one day. I also believe in Chinese football. The dream will be realised in the near future.""

"LONDON (AP) — Serena Williams' recent marriage has shined a spotlight on one of Wimbledon's many quirky traditions.
Suddenly ""Miss Williams"" has become ""Mrs. Williams"" in the words of chair umpires — a small change that has led to bigger-picture questions about whether the All England Club is too old-fashioned.
Only the women at the grass-court Grand Slam are addressed with a title before their names to reflect their marital status.
In other words, when a chair umpire announces that Serena has won a game, it's, ""Game, Mrs. Williams.""
For her sister Venus, it's, ""Game, Miss Williams.""
And for Roger Federer, it's simply: ""Game, Federer.""
It's a difference that is in contrast to other moves in the name of gender equality in tennis. Since 2007, there is equal prize money for men and women at all Grand Slam tournaments. And over the first three days this week, there were more women's matches scheduled for Centre Court than men's — something that decades ago just wouldn't happen.
However, the players themselves seem rather indifferent — or even unaware — when it comes to how they are addressed.
""They call Serena 'Mrs. Williams'?"" Venus asked after her second-round victory when the subject was raised. ""That's cool. I mean, I remember Janet Jackson had that song and she said, 'Miss Jackson.' I like that. I am Miss Williams, so ... .""
The ""Miss"" or ""Mrs."" used to be included on scoreboards as well, but that tradition was dropped in 2009.
Federer said he hadn't realized that the women are addressed differently depending on their marital status. He's also perfectly fine with chair umpires not using a ""Mr."" in front of his and other male players' names.
""For me, I'm happy if they say whatever they say, as long as it is 'game' and my name somewhere, and not 'game' and the other name,"" Federer said with a laugh Wednesday. ""That makes sense, right?""
This is Serena's first Wimbledon since she married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in November. That union has given her a new place in Wimbledon's official fact book as well — in the list that details the marriages of all past women's champions, runners-up and semifinalists.
There are no such marriage lists for the men.
""I actually never knew they had that,"" Williams said after her second-round victory on Centre Court. ""It will be interesting to know why it's not for both sexes.""
The tournament fact book shows multiple marriages as well — 1923 doubles runner-up Joan Austin had four husbands, for instance — although Williams is confident that will never apply to her.
""Hopefully,"" she said, ""it will be just one.""",www.taiwannews.com.tw,2018-07-05 04:39:00,29,2080

FIFA's patience with Diego Maradona's World Cup antics finally ran out on Wednesday.
Soccer's world body said it ""strongly rebukes"" comments by the Argentina great criticizing American referee Mark Geiger's handling of England's win against Colombia in the World Cup round of 16.
It was yet another controversial moment involving Maradona —an official FIFA ambassador and figurehead of its ""Legends"" program celebrating former players — at a World Cup he has mostly attended as a VIP guest of FIFA.
FIFA hit back at Maradona for telling Venezuelan broadcaster Telesur the outcome of Tuesday's game in Moscow was a ""monumental theft.""
Maradona had been photographed before the game wearing a yellow Colombia jersey.
England advanced to the quarterfinals in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw in a feisty game slowed by stoppages and players arguing with Geiger, a former high school teacher from New Jersey.
FIFA said Maradona's ""insinuations"" were ""entirely inappropriate and completely unfounded.""
""FIFA is extremely sorry to read such declarations from a player who has written the history of our game,"" it said in a statement.
FIFA had tolerated previous incidents by Maradona at games in Russia, which the 1986 World Cup winning captain was left to explain on his Facebook page.
He apologized for making an offensive gesture toward a South Korean fan at Argentina's opening 1-1 draw with Iceland in Moscow. He then suggested media were trying to make headlines from an innocent incident and also broke World Cup stadium rules by smoking a cigar.
Maradona was filmed on FIFA's official television broadcast aggressively raising his middle fingers after Argentina scored a late winning goal against Nigeria in St. Petersburg.
He was also seen on footage circulated on social media seeming to be unwell and assisted from his seat into a private dining area.
FIFA has had a turbulent relationship with Maradona in his career as a player and coach.
He tested positive for a cocktail of banned substances at the 1994 World Cup in the United States and was sent home from the tournament.
As Argentina's coach in 2009, a FIFA suspension for a tirade aimed at reporters after a World Cup qualifying game barred Maradona from attending the 2010 finals draw in Cape Town, South Africa.
Maradona was an outspoken critic of previous FIFA president Sepp Blatter, but was brought back into the fold when Gianni Infantino was elected in 2016.
He came to the Kremlin in Moscow last December wearing a gold bow tie to take part in the 2018 draw.

As the new general manager of Gladstone Power Station, announced this week, Charles Mason will bring years of experience in management positions at three United States NRG power stations.
Mr Mason also had 20 years of service in power plant operation and maintenance with the US Navy.
He will take over the role from acting general manager of 20 months Nigel Warrington, who guided the company through organisational changes, and a lengthy dispute with unions about changes to the enterprise bargaining agreement.
The power station's new general manager Charles Mason.
The dispute ended in June 2017 with employees voting in favour of what the company was proposing.
Mr Warrington said his core priority was to manage a number of organisational and safety changes.
""With those now in place, we look to continue this momentum and success with the operational and engineering expertise Chuck will bring to the station,"" Mr Warrington said.
Currently living in Prospect at Kentucky, Mr Mason and his wife Karen said they were excited about their move to Gladstone.
Mr Mason is particularly keen about working with a new team.
""It's a great honour having been selected to lead one of the largest and most successful power stations in the NRG fleet,"" he said.
""I'm looking forward to the opportunity to work with all of the team to continue the station's success for the future.""
With a firm understanding of the importance of employee safety, Chuck is committed to ensuring that this remains a priority at the station.
""The safety of our employees is paramount and we'll focus on continuing the recent excellent safety performance, alongside our responsibility to be a great environmental steward - both of which are NRG's core beliefs - all the while managing the assets to deliver on our long term power contracts for our customers.""
He will begin his role at the Gladstone Power Station in late July.

"Brazil are the favorites in what Belgium coach Roberto Martinez described as a ""dream match"" for his players when the two countries meet in a World Cup quarterfinal in Kazan on Friday.
""These two teams are constructed to score and to win matches. Against Brazil, it will not be about ball possession, but what you do with it. That's what this World Cup is all about,"" the Spaniard told Belgian media on Wednesday.
""We know what we are capable of but Brazil are the favorites, putting us into a different role,"" he added. ""But it's a dream match for our players, they were born to play in a match like this. Naturally we want to win but we are not expected to and that is an important difference.""
Martinez saw his side rally from the brink of elimination to snatch a last-gasp 3-2 win over Japan in the Round of 16 on Monday, booking a meeting with the five-time World Cup winners.
At times in Rostov-on-Don, Belgium looked hamstrung by Japan's pressing tactics and needed more than an hour to unshackle themselves and set about a dramatic come-from-behind victory after falling 2-0 down.
For Friday's match, the tactics might be simpler.
""Against a team like Brazil, you must attack and defend with 11 players. We are not talking about a system but understanding what we must do when we have possession,"" the coach added. ""I don't think it will be a game with many secrets. We have to defend as well as we can and then cause them pain when we have the ball. It can be that simple and this squad is ready for that.""
Martinez now faces a tricky decision concerning his line-up with Nacer Chadli and Marouane Fellaini pressing for starts after coming off the bench against Japan to turn the game around in the last half an hour.
""As a coach, I have a lot of options with this team but I know in my head what I want to do. We will need power,"" he said in a hint that the physical presence of Fellaini might be deployed from the beginning.
""If we show the same mentality as we did on Monday, we have a big chance.""
Belgium play in a second successive World Cup quarterfinal, looking to reach the semifinals for the second time after they advanced to the last four in Mexico 32 years ago.
""We have worked hard over two years for this and we are as ready as we ever can be. We've won all our games, everyone has played and we've scored 12 times. The game against Japan gave us a big boost,"" he said.
""There is something special about this squad. If we play well, we can create a lot of chances. But there is no margin for error. If we give Brazil a chance, they will take it. I think it will be the match of the tournament.""
The winner of the tie will face either France or Uruguay in St Petersburg on July 10.

"By Osamu Tsukimori
Japan's Inpex Corp has delayed gas production from its giant Ichthys field off the coast of Australia just weeks after giving assurances that output would start imminently.
Inpex's new chief executive officer told Reuters the company was yet to start churning out gas from the $40 billion project and did not give a timetable for when that would happen.
Japan's biggest oil and gas producer had said on June 1 that commissioning of all onshore and offshore facilities at the much-delayed project was complete and that gas would start flowing within a week or two.
""There are various minor issues to address in the final safety checks ... but there are no major problems with the facilities,"" Ueda, 61, said on Tuesday in his first interview with overseas media since taking the helm at Inpex last month.
The liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, already hit by multiple delays, is a major test for Inpex as it marks the first time it has operated a major energy development on its own.
""We can start production in the not too distant future,"" Ueda said, without giving details. He added that the company is keeping its target to ship its first LNG cargo by the end of September.
Delays are common with large projects like Ichthys, but the development has been plagued by a wide range of issues, including contractor disputes, technical difficulties and bad weather.
At full operation, Ichthys is expected to produce 8.9 million tons of LNG a year, along with about 1.7 million tons of liquefied petroleum gas and around 100,000 barrels per day of condensate, an ultra-light form of crude oil.

"BANJA LUKA, Bosnia: The parliament of Bosnia's autonomous Serb Republic approved a bill raising wages by up to 12.5 percent on Wednesday, violating terms agreed under a loan deal with the International Monetary Fund, in a move seen as a sweetener ahead of October elections.
Last week, the IMF Executive Board postponed at the last minute a meeting called to conclude a review of Bosnia's loan programme which would unlock fresh aid, saying its staff needed more time to evaluate recent cabinet decisions to increase spending.

The lender's move came after the Serb Republic government announced it would reduce income tax, raising net wages, while keeping overall pay unchanged, violating a deal with the lender under which it pledged not to increase salaries.
Bosnia's other region, the Bosniak-Croat Federation, has also caused the IMF concern by planning to pass a law next week expanding the rights of veterans from the country's war in the 1990s, a move that has not been agreed with the lender.
In a hastily called session, the deputies in the 83-seat Serb parliament approved the new income tax and wage bills with 44 lawmakers voting in favour. Opposition MPs left the session earlier over an unrelated dispute with the deputies from the ruling coalition.
Finance Minister Zoran Tegeltija denied that the terms of the IMF deal were violated, saying that payment allocations were changed only for employees that receive the lowest wages and who account for 1.1 percent of the total workforce in the region.

""If I have to choose between the IMF and these workers, it's clear what I will choose,"" Tegeltija told the parliament.
The bills will come into force in August.
The new spending legislation in Bosnia's two regions is widely seen as part of campaigning by ruling parties ahead of the Oct. 7 parliamentary and presidential elections.

"Months after the death of Sudan, the world’s last male northern white rhino, scientists said they have grown embryos containing DNA of his kind, hoping to save the subspecies from extinction.
With only two northern white rhino known to be alive today – both infertile females – the team hopes their breakthrough technique will lead to the re-establishment of a viable northern white rhino breeding population.
“Our goal is to have in three years the first NWR calf born,” Thomas Hildebrandt, head of reproduction management at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin, told journalists of the work on Wednesday.
“Taking into account 16 months (of) pregnancy, we have a little more than a year to have a successful implantation.”
The team’s work, using a recently patented, two-metre (6.6-foot) egg extraction device, resulted in the first-ever test tube-produced rhino embryos.
Now frozen, these “have a very high chance to establish a pregnancy once implanted into a surrogate mother”, Hildebrandt said.
The hybrid embryos were created with frozen sperm from dead northern white rhino males and the eggs of southern white rhino females, of which there are thousands left on Earth.
The eggs were harvested from rhinos in European zoos.
The team now hopes to use the technique to collect eggs from the last two northern white rhinos – Najin and Fatu, the daughter and granddaughter of Sudan. They live in a Kenyan national park.
By fertilising these with northern white rhino sperm and implanting the resulting embryos in surrogate southern white rhino females, the team intends to create a new, fledgling northern white rhino population.
“Our results indicate that ART (assisted reproduction techniques) could be a viable strategy to rescue genes from the iconic, almost extinct, northern white rhinoceros,” the team wrote in the journal Nature Communications.
The researchers have sought permission to harvest eggs from Najin and Fatu in Kenya, hopefully before the end of the year.
But the procedure is not without risk: “we have to do a full anaesthesia, the animal is down for two hours, and it is quite a risky situation” for the last two of their kind, Hildebrandt conceded.
“We are highly afraid something unexpected would happen that would be a nightmare.”
In the meantime, the team will practice, implanting some of their hybrid embryos into southern white rhino surrogates “to test the system”.
Any hybrids born as a result may play a crucial future role as surrogates, sharing more genes with northern rhinos than purely southern surrogates.
There is, however, a key obstacle to the team’s envisaged northern white rhino repopulation.
With only two northern white rhino females left and all the available semen from only four dead males, assisted reproduction techniques alone would likely lead to a population without the genetic diversity required for a species to thrive.
To this end, the researchers hope to use stem cell technology to engineer eggs and sperm from the frozen skin cells of 12 dead northern white rhinos, unrelated to one another.
“This would enlarge the founding diversity of the future NWR population substantially,” the team said in a statement.
There is time pressure, they pointed out, with only two animals still around to socialise the babies in the mysterious ways of northern white rhinos.
“It is a motivating aspect to succeed as soon a possible so the calf that we produce can grow up with Najin and Fatu,” Hildebrandt said.
Terri Roth and William Swanson of the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, in a comment on the study, said assisted reproduction techniques alone cannot save a species from extinction.
“Impressive results in a Petri dish don’t easily translate into a herd of healthy offspring,” wrote the duo, not involved in the research.
“Achieving the latter requires navigating an untrodden path fraught with obstacles, and it remains unlikely that a viable population of northern white rhinos will be restored.”
For the researchers, however, a combination of assisted research techniques and stem cell techniques could “provide a blueprint on how to save highly endangered species that have already dwindled to numbers that make conventional conservation efforts impossible”.",www.scmp.com,2018-07-05 04:15:00,24,501168

"MOSCOW (AP) — The wine was flowing under the chandeliers of the luxury London hotel ballroom when Gareth Southgate was given a painful reminder of the most agonizing moment of his playing career.
Surrounded by current and former players, Southgate was trying to look forward to his World Cup as England coach when he was taken back 22 years.
Inside the awards' dinner speech at the Grosvenor House in April, Southgate had to endure the penalty miss that led to England losing the 1996 European Championship semifinal being a punchline in a speech by Professional Footballers' Association chairman Ben Purkiss.
Many athletes would have recoiled at being the object of derision in an audience of their peers. Purkiss later felt compelled to contact Harry Kane to explain a joke at the England striker's expense.
But Southgate hasn't tried to hide away from his own misfortune in the glare of the world — from the self-deprecating Pizza Hut advertisement at the time to talks with the England squad now under his command.
""When something goes wrong in your life,"" Southgate advises, ""it doesn't finish you.""
You can even lead the national team.
Progress at the World Cup in Russia has been secured by the shootout that has haunted England for so long. A victory over Colombia on Tuesday carried the English into their first World Cup quarterfinal since 2006 and was the work of meticulous planning.
England teams have been practicing penalties for years without being able to find a way of coming out on top when games end tied after extra time and the winner is determined by a test of strength between a striker and goalkeeper separated by 12 yards (meters).
So much of Southgate's job has been about changing the mindset of a country that is credited with inventing soccer but has been scarred by failures on the international stage, aside from the senior team's only title at the 1966 World Cup.
Players had been told for years that penalties were a lottery. Southgate told them it was a process they could own.
""It's not about luck,"" he said ahead of the 4-3 shootout win over Colombia. ""It's not about chance. It's about performing a skill under pressure. There are individual things you can work on within that. We have to know who is in charge, who needs to get out of the way, who can speak with clarity to the players.""
Not fearing failure was a significant psychological hurdle to overcome.
Southgate embraced his own public humiliation to help the current generation of players prepare to cope with setbacks. At the St. George's Park training complex in central England, the messages and tactics have been transmitted through the age groups of England teams.
Slowly, England is shaking off its losing mentality. Victory in the under-20s World Cup in June 2017 was followed by glory in the under-17s edition in October, and now Southgate's squad remains on track to add a third FIFA title.
Whereas past England sides might have recoiled after conceding a stoppage time equalizer to Colombia, this group held on through extra time and broke the penalties' curse.
Before Tuesday night in Moscow, England since 1990 had been knocked out of three World Cups on penalties and three European Championships. The only success came at the Euro '96 against Spain before Southgate's miss in the semifinal against Germany.
With England fans outnumbered by Colombians in the Spartak Moscow stadium, it was an even greater test of nerves for Eric Dier to make the winning kick against Colombia.
""It was like an out of body experience,"" Dier said Wednesday. ""I just tried to stay in the moment.""
Southgate has been working to remove players from their comfort zone after seeing — as a UEFA technical observer — how Roy Hodgson's England froze under pressure and was eliminated by Iceland in the Euro 2016 round of 16. Players were taken last year to the Royal Marines' Commando Training Centre. One exercise at the boot camp saw players submerged in water.
""(Southgate) wanted to change the way we are and try something different,"" Kane recalled. ""Because in recent times we haven't been great for England in tournaments. It's about trying to change that mental attitude.""
Southgate had initially rejected the chance to succeed Hodgson after the Euro 2016, believing he lacked experience, having only coached a senior team for three years at Middlesbrough until 2009.
But after three years as England's under-21s coach, Southgate was jettisoned into the top job in September 2016 by an unexpected vacancy when Sam Allardyce lasted just one game before his brashness and unguarded bar talk forced the English Football Association to part company.
At 47, Southgate has been keen to look beyond soccer for inspiration, particularly on trips to NBA and NFL games. He has retained steeliness while bringing compassion and warmth to the job.
The defining image, perhaps, of Tuesday in Moscow was not Southgate celebrating but of him consoling Mateus Uribe, whose eyes were covered by his Colombian jersey after his missed kick. That's a reflection of the human touch England players have come to expect from Southgate.
""We have spoken a lot about togetherness,"" Kane said, ""and we've got a great bond off the pitch.""

"LONDON (AP) — As Roger Federer was winning 35 consecutive service points at Wimbledon on Wednesday — yes, 35 in a row — a Centre Court spectator cheered him on while wearing a red shirt with white lettering that said, ""PeRFect.""
The Swiss great comes pretty close to living up to that at times.
Federer moved into the third round at the All England Club as he chases his record-extending ninth championship there, using close-to-impeccable serving to beat 73rd-ranked Lukas Lacko of Slovakia 6-4, 6-4, 6-1.
The 36-year-old Federer compiled 48 winners and just 11 unforced errors. He won 40 of 43 first-serve points, never faced a break chance, and delivered 16 aces.
""Sometimes your serve matches up better against certain players,"" he said. ""There's no doubt about that.""
Talk about an understatement.
At 4-3, 40-30, Federer hit a 118 mph ace to hold and start his roll that included the last five points he served in the first set, all 20 in the second, and then the first 10 of the third. By then, it was so dominant that one television announcer was moved to jokingly exclaim, ""Come on, double-fault!""
Federer did not oblige, but moments later, he did lose a point he served at 4-1, 30-love, when Lacko smacked a down-the-line backhand passing winner.
""I think (what's) important when you want to serve well is your point-for-point mentality, saying, maybe, 'The first point is as important as a break point,' so the concentration is the same,"" Federer explained. ""Trying to remember all the things you've done throughout the entire match — what has worked, what hasn't worked.""
Very little did not work on this day, and he's allowed his two opponents to collect a total of 17 games through six sets.
Very little hasn't worked for him over the years at Wimbledon, even now that he's in his mid-30s.
Wednesday's result increased Federer's streak to 26 straight sets at Wimbledon, equaling his second-best run, which came in 2003-04. His best was a 34-streak sequence from 2005-06.
A year ago, Federer became the first man since Bjorn Borg in 1976 to win the title at the grass-court Grand Slam tournament without ceding a single set.
So what, Federer was asked, makes him so successful on grass ?
""I don't know. I don't know,"" he began, before offering quite a list for someone who doesn't know.
""Maybe it's that it helps my slice. That maybe the footwork on grass comes easier to me than for other guys. I'm not sure. Then because I have a decent speed on the serve, and I can serve kick and slice. Maybe also the grass helps me just a little bit to get a few more free points than what it would on some other surfaces.""

"Narco cop gunned down in drug bust
1 SHARES Share Tweet
By Aaron Recuenco
Anti-scalawag operatives of the Philippine National Police (PNP) gunned down on Tuesday a cop from Morong, Rizal in a drug-bust that stemmed from an intelligence report that he was engaged in recycling confiscated shabu.
Police Officer 2 Gemmo Meneses was the second active policeman who died at the hands of the Counter-Intelligence Task Force CITF) under Senior Supt. Romeo Caramat who earlier warned erring cops to just resign from the service.
“The operation stemmed from a validated intelligence packet stating that suspect police officer is involved in recycling illegal drugs (shabu) and distributing it to his street drug pushers,” said Caramat.
That place, according to Caramat, is Morong town where Meneses was assigned.
CITF operatives and agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) immediately conducted a drug-bust which resulted in the death of Meneses at around 4:30 p.m. in Barangay Maybancal in Morong town.
“He immediately drew his firearm when he sensed that he was dealing with a poseur buyer policeman and aimed towards the operative, prompting the operatives to return fire hitting the suspect on his body,” said Caramat.
Meneses was taken to the hospital for treatment but he was declared dead on arrival.
Nearly a hundred policemen have been arrested since the CITF was formed in February last year following the death of a South Korean businessman at the hands of erring cops.

Thirty contestants from around the world, including a hearing-impaired, were presented to media Tuesday at Resorts World Manila as official candidates to this year’s Man of the World pageant.
Richard Montoya, Prime Event Productions Philippines, Inc. Foundation Director for Legal, described this year’s contest as “competitive.”
“The number of candidates would have been higher than 30. But for unknown reasons, some of them were not allowed by their talent management to compete,” he says.
Juan Carlos Cabrera Torres, a hearing-impaired looker from Lima, Peru, says he joined the pageant to inspire others like him. “I want to inspire the handicapped that we can do more.’’
Clint Karklins Peralta, a registered nurse from Camarines Sur, is the country’s representative to the pageant.
The Bicolano hunk says the contest would be his last.
“Win or lose, after my reign in Misters of Filipinas, I am going to London to work as a nurse. I have no plans of competing in other pageants anymore,” says the Filipino candidate who also has Polish and Latvian blood.
During the pre-pageant show, five contestants received the Media Choice Awards.

The budget Surface would be designed to better compete with Apple iPads.
WinFuture reported Wednesday that sources inside the company say the new device will use Intel Pentium chips, which are less expensive and less powerful than Core chips. Current Surface Pro tablets use Intel Core chips and start at $800.
Meanwhile, a series of FCC filings this week back up reports that a new Surface device will launch this year.
Some details about the rumored tablet have come via Bloomberg, which reported earlier this year that the new Surface will have a 10-inch screen. Current Surface Pro models have 12-inch screens.

"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has taken great pride in firing nearly two dozen officials in an anti-corruption drive since he came to power two years ago. The catch: about a quarter have already been rehired.
Duterte has fired 21 officials and accepted the resignation of seven, delivering on a promise to dismiss anyone on “just a whiff” of corruption.
“If you go to the national government just to look for an opportunity for money, go look for another job. I will really fire you,” Duterte told employees of the Department of Agrarian Reform on June 20.
I will stop corruption. I have been firing officials left and right every day
Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte
On June 14 he told local officials: “I will stop corruption. I have been firing officials left and right every day. Undersecretaries, chiefs of offices, education officials, all of them.”
Corruption remains a significant barrier to trade and investment in the Philippines, the US trade representative said in a report released in April.
Under Duterte, the country ranked 111th of 180 nations in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index for 2017, down from 101st in 2016.
Investors want to see courts and anti-corruption institutions strengthened, said Bob Herrera-Lim, a managing director for Teneo Strategy, a global business advisory firm.
In Duterte’s firing spree, all of those accused of corruption, excessive travel and accepting bribes have so far gone unpunished. Seven have been rehired.
“If you’re a foreign investor, you don’t care about the internal politics,” Herrera-Lim said. “You just want to know if people are investigated, if the system functions to see things through to its natural conclusion.”
Of those who left their posts, 12 were agency heads, including Tourism Secretary Wanda Teo, who was accused of giving her siblings 60 million pesos (US$1.1 million) to broadcast television ads. Teo referred questions to her lawyer, who has not responded.
Duterte has given new jobs to at least seven officials who left their posts under a cloud.
That includes Nicanor Faeldon, who quit his post as head of the Bureau of Customs last year amid a scandal involving the smuggling of 6.4 billion pesos (US$118 million) worth of crystal methamphetamine that dragged in Duterte’s oldest child, Paolo.
Faeldon, who was the subject of Senate, Justice and Ombudsman investigations, is now a deputy administrator in the Office of Civil Defence. Faeldon did not respond when asked to comment on his reappointment, but he denied the bribery allegations in an earlier televised briefing.
Jose Gabriel La Viña, who worked on Duterte’s social media campaign during the 2016 election, has been reincarnated more than once – first as Social Security System commissioner, where he was said to have “abused” public funds, then as tourism undersecretary and, recently, as agriculture undersecretary.
La Viña said in a text message that he would issue a statement addressing his reappointment. In an earlier television interview, he said he had never abused public funds.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said that it was Duterte’s prerogative to reassign people and that this was “more the exception than the rule.”
Duterte’s decisiveness in firing reportedly corrupt officials is a positive step in the short term for a nation where courts have been slow to fight corruption, American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines legislative chairman John Forbes said.
“It seems that when he gets reports on corruption, he doesn’t even wait to investigate,” Forbes said. “How can he send a stronger signal than that?”
Others take a dimmer view.
The government is like a “merry-go-round of appointments and abuse,” Ronald Mendoza, dean of the Manila-based Ateneo School of Government, said via email.
He warned that corruption scandals may lower the president’s waning popularity, adding that it remains to be seen “whether the people will associate corruption with key officials only, or begin to link these to the president himself”.
Although the problem has improved slightly in the private sector, petty corruption remains pervasive, said Eufracia Taylor, a senior Asia analyst at global risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.
“Despite government’s efforts, the culture of corruption appears unchanged, and the issue continues to rank highly in foreign investor concerns in the country.”",www.scmp.com,2018-07-05 03:57:27,30,501008
"LONDON: The FIFA rankings state Switzerland are the sixth best soccer team in the world but Roger Federer said his ""lethargic"" countrymen got what they deserved at the World Cup after they were beaten 1-0 by Sweden in the Round of 16.

As Switzerland's most famous sporting export, did Federer wish he could have given them a pep talk?
""Now the pep talk is too late anyway,"" said the 36-year-old, who is five wins away from claiming a record ninth Wimbledon title.
""It's important that they understand you've got to bring the energy every single day. It's throughout the year. It's not just in the World Cup, last 16 or quarters. That's why you need to bring it every single day.
""When you step out on the pitch, or on the court in tennis, in practice, in the match, you have to always try to be able to perform as high as possible. Then it's actually not a big deal to bring it also in a match like yesterday.""
Federer's disciplined training regime has helped him to prolong his career well into his 30s and as he approaches his 37th birthday, he remains the man to beat at Wimbledon.
It is a doctrine he feels the country's soccer team should follow.
""What I know from knockout play throughout the course of my career is (that) you can't afford to come in lethargic,"" Federer said.
""You just think it's going to happen by itself, just because you play one good match the day before. You're only as good as your next performance really.""",www.channelnewsasia.com,2018-07-05 03:55:24,25,204541
"MAYOR Tom Tate is powering ahead with his ambitious plan to create a pyramid dive site off the Gold Coast and is already setting up a panel of experts to nut out the design details.
The project has been welcomed by the State Government with Tourism Minister Kate Jones offering to tip in half the estimated cost of $5 million and last night, Ian Banks, one of the city's leading dive figures, threw his weight behind the project.
Cr Tate said a working committee was being set up with the State Government's Department of Innovation and Tourism Industry Development, council's Infrastructure Directorate, key representatives of the city's dive and marine industries, as well as marine engineers.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, Cr Tate’s inspiration.
He confirmed the City would pursue a design-construct project for the artificial dive attraction in response to the Gold Coast losing the HMAS Darwin to Tasmania.
""The initial structure will be a pyramid design, first mooted by council in 2014, and council will need to vote on the final design and funding model,"" he said.
""In the lead up, the City will consult with the dive industry to finalise which features a pyramid structure would require to attract marine life and the interest of divers.""
Cr Tate said the pyramid would be the first installation in a broader, artificial dive precinct.
""We will develop and expand the artificial dive site over the years, starting with the pyramid structure as the signature piece,"" he said.

Other structures to be added to the site could include 20m-high, concrete trees in an underwater garden and the aim was for each precinct to attract its own marine life.
""The site we are looking at is two nautical miles off Narrowneck, east of the existing wreck known as the Scottish Prince,"" Cr Tate said.
""It will take divers about 25 minutes to access the site from the Broadwater - less than half the travel time it takes to access HMAS Brisbane, off the Sunshine Coast. I am confident divers will flock to the Gold Coast for this.""

The mayor said the skeleton-type, pyramid would allow divers to swim through it.
""Beginners will be able to go down 10m-18m on the pyramid, while advanced divers will be able to dive down to the bottom of the structure, which will be more than 30m deep.
""This will be an evolving project and divers will be able to dive on one precinct and then return another day to dive on another, if they want to,"" he said.
Cr Tate said the dive precinct would not just be about attracting marine life, but also about offering opportunities for memorable photography.

""We wanted a warship but they are expensive. Some divers are saying there are already so many of them. This pyramid and its precincts would be unique,"" he said.
Meanwhile, leading dive expert Mr Banks has welcomed the proposed underwater pyramid and precinct.
""It's a really good idea. The extra habitat and marine life would be great,"" he said.

""A pyramid structure would attract all sorts of marine life to the area, including a range of fish species, and I think the precincts are also a great idea.""
Mr Banks, who has 40 years' experience in the dive industry, said he was part of the planning group for sinking a warship off the Gold Coast.
""I surveyed the proposed site for a warship and I agree this would be the easiest location for this pyramid structure. We had to go a long way out to get clear water,"" he said.
He was confident coral could also grow on the structure at certain depths.
""It's not ideal for coral because there is a lot of turbidity but soft coral and sponges could grow at the bottom of the pyramid. Other coral would have to be within the top 10m of the structure to thrive,"" he said.",www.dailyexaminer.com.au,2018-07-05 03:53:06,33,692446
"EU lawmakers gave approval on Wednesday for the European Investment Bank (EIB) to do business in Iran, overcoming a blocking attempt and keeping alive plans to save the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran that Washington has abandoned.
BRUSSELS: EU lawmakers gave approval on Wednesday for the European Investment Bank (EIB) to do business in Iran, overcoming a blocking attempt and keeping alive plans to save the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran that Washington has abandoned.
The EIB, the European Union's not-for-profit long term investment arm, is a key pillar of the bloc's attempts to maintain business links with Iran in the face of Washington's decision to re-impose sanctions on the Islamic Republic.

However, the EU lawmakers' decision does not oblige the EIB to work with Iran, a move that could jeopardise its ability to raise money on U.S. markets and so have far reaching consequences for its operations.
The European Parliament overwhelmingly blocked a motion by far-right lawmakers seeking to prevent the European Commission from lifting restrictions on the EIB in Iran, setting the stage for the measure to come into effect at the start of August.
The blocking motion, put forward by the far-right Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group (EFDD) that includes Britain's eurosceptic United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), failed with only 93 votes for, 573 against and 11 abstentions.
""We are granting the EIB the capacity to invest in Iran if suitable projects are found,"" said Siegfried Muresan, a lawmaker from the centre-right European People's Party (EPP), which led the preparatory discussions on the Commission's proposal.

""The Iran deal is good for Europe's security,"" he told Reuters, referring to the accord signed by world powers in 2015 that curbs Tehran's ability to develop nuclear weapons.
EU governments can technically still block the Commission proposal but are not expected to do so given EU leaders publicly backed the EIB lending plan at a summit in May.
The parliament's decision is likely to be a morale boost for EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who will chair a meeting of the foreign ministers of Iran, China, France, Germany and Britain in Vienna on Friday to discuss progress on salvaging the nuclear deal.
Iran requested the meeting to discuss European efforts to protect the nuclear pact in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's May 8 decision to pull out and revive Iran-related sanctions, after the expiry of 90- and 180-day periods.
The sanctions start to come into effect in August but some European companies investing in Iran and with big operations in the United States have announced they will pull out of business deals with Tehran.
The pillars of the EU's strategy are: EIB lending, a special measure to shield EU companies from U.S. secondary sanctions and a Commission proposal that EU governments make direct money transfers to Iran's central bank to avoid U.S. penalties.
However, the Luxembourg-based EIB is concerned about the proposal that it do business in Iran, EU sources told Reuters in June, fearing the threat of U.S. sanctions could imperil its ability to raise funds on U.S. capital markets.
""Maintaining access to these markets is a quasi life-or-death issue for the EIB,"" bank Director General Bertrand de Mazieres told a European Parliament budget committee hearing in late May, saying there were US$120 billion (90.7 billion pounds) of outstanding bonds issued by the EIB worldwide.
The EIB currently steers clear of engaging in jurisdictions listed as high-risk under the FATF, a global group of government anti-money-laundering agencies. That includes Iran.

"Two attendees of the disastrous Fyre music festival, which promised Caribbean glamour but delivered chaos, have been awarded US$2.5 million each in compensation and damages after they sued the organiser Billy McFarland.
Seth Crossno and Mark Thompson each paid US$13,000 for VIP tickets to the festival on the Bahamas island of Great Exuma, which, after promotion by social media influencer supermodels such as Bella Hadid, was set to feature music from Migos, Major Lazer and Blink-182 in a luxurious setting.
But the festival quickly became notorious when the accommodation turned out to be dome tents and the food cheese sandwiches; attendees also found themselves stranded at the airport when they tried to leave.
Crossno and Thompson filed a lawsuit in May 2017 and were awarded damages based on losses for hotels and flights as well as the “mental anguish” they faced.
“This was more than just a scam,” Crossno said. “It was fraud that was way over the top.”
Their lawyer, Stacy Miller, said McFarland “lured these young men away from their homes to another country. It was a very dangerous and scary situation.”
McFarland is currently in jail, awaiting sentencing for fraud charges he pleaded guilty to in March.
He has since been accused of a scam in which he produced fake tickets for the Met Gala and a Victoria’s Secret fashion show. McFarland’s lawyer said they would “vigorously contest” those accusations.
McFarland is believed to have some remaining assets – US$50,000 in cash and a monthly US$40,000 income – though it is uncertain how much of their award Crossno and Thompson will be able to secure.
“I think there’s going to be a lot of people looking to collect, but we’ll be first,” Miller said.
The rapper Ja Rule, who co-organised the festival with McFarland, was initially named in the lawsuit but was later removed after an unspecified agreement was reached.",www.scmp.com,2018-07-05 03:48:55,12,501024
"The party of Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and its allies will have an outright majority in Congress but will not surpass the two-thirds threshold needed to change the constitution, estimates show.
MEXICO CITY: The party of Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and its allies will have an outright majority in Congress but will not surpass the two-thirds threshold needed to change the constitution, estimates show.
Lopez Obrador, a leftist, won a landslide victory on Sunday, and will wield considerable power in a Congress set to have the highest concentration of female lawmakers in Mexican history.
Advertisement
For the first time, there may be more female senators than male, and a nearly 50-50 split in the lower house, Mexico's electoral institute projects, underlining the far-reaching consequences of Lopez Obrador's win.
Tapping into widespread disillusionment with years of violence, corruption and inequality in Latin America's No. 2 economy, Lopez Obrador won about 53 percent of votes.
His victory has upended Mexico's political status quo, in which just two parties have held the presidency since 1929, and drawn a line under decades of technocratic rule. No ruling party has held an absolute majority in Congress since 1997.
Lopez Obrador's triumph extended to both houses of Congress, where his National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party and its partners are seen winning 61 percent of seats in the 500-member lower house, projections by pollster Consulta Mitofsky show.

His coalition, which includes the leftist Labor Party and the Social Encounter Party (PES), a religious, socially conservative anti-abortion group, is projected to win 53 percent of seats in the 128-member Senate, Mitofsky said.
The congressional advantage will help Lopez Obrador deliver on his pledge to radically reshape Mexico, which he intends to do by helping the poor while also keeping investors happy.
""It makes the day-to-day easier,"" Carlos Urzua, Lopez Obrador's pick for finance minister, told Reuters on Monday.
Though the estimates suggest Lopez Obrador will lack the two-thirds majority in both houses needed to make constitutional changes, he may still benefit from defections in Congress. Urzua said the government had no plans to change the constitution.
Final congressional results are expected by Saturday.
NEW CONGRESS
The results are a severe blow to the established parties.
The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which governed Mexico continuously from 1929 to 2000, and again from 2012, is seen with 45 seats in the lower house, according to Mitofsky, down from over 200 in the 2012 election.
The PRI is likely to get 13 seats in the Senate, Mitofsky said, down from over 50 six years ago.
Tainted by corruption scandals, the PRI has become increasingly reviled under Enrique Pena Nieto for failing to get a grip on security and lift the economy.
The National Action Party, which ruled between 2000 and 2012 and became embroiled in a grisly drug war, was seen winning 82 seats in the lower house and 24 in the Senate, according to Mitofsky, well below their 2012 tallies.
Still, Lopez Obrador's coalition may prove unwieldy.
The 64-year-old will have to balance interests of leftist nationalists, social liberals and religious conservatives.
So far Lopez Obrador has kept a lid on potential conflict by adopting ambiguous stances on contentious issues such as abortion, gay marriage and economic liberalisation.
But his tie-up with the PES may prove tough, and it faces resistance from supporters on the left.

"Four-time Tour de France cycling race winner Chris Froome of Britain answers questions during a TV interview after a press conference in Saint-Mars-la-Reorthe, Vendee region, France, Wednesday, July 4, 2018, ahead of upcoming Saturday's start of the race. (AP Photo/Christophe Ena )

By JOSEPH WILSON
Chris Froome has asked Tour de France fans to let him race in peace, even if they doubt the recent ruling that cleared him of doping allegations.
The British cyclist has been targeted by spectators in the past. During the 2015 Tour, he said a man threw a cup of urine at him while yelling ""doper"".
With the latest edition beginning on Saturday, five days after the International Cycling Union finally ruled Froome had won last year's Spanish Vuelta cleanly, the four-time Tour winner offered an alternative way for skeptical fans to show their distrust.
""Support the race in a positive way, don't bring negativity,"" he said on Wednesday in western France. ""In terms of safety I obviously would encourage fans of the sport to come watch the race, and if you are not necessarily a Chris Froome fan or a Sky fan, come to the race and put a jersey on of another team you do support. That would be my advice.""
A cloud hung over Froome after a urine sample taken during the Vuelta in September showed a concentration of the asthma drug salbutamol that was twice the permitted level.
After months of silence, the UCI said Froome's result did not represent an adverse finding, which could have led him to be stripped of his Vuelta victory, and a suspension.
The UCI's ruling ensured he could compete at the Tour after race organizer ASO had informed Team Sky it would forbid Froome from entering until the doping case was decided.
His use of asthma medication has been well documented and he often uses inhalers during races. World Anti-Doping Agency rules state an athlete can be cleared for excessive salbutamol use if he proves it was due to an appropriate therapeutic dosage.
Froome said he understands it may take time for fans to believe he is not a cheat.
""But that data is available, and I would like to think that as people understand that more, they will understand my decision to keep on racing knowing I have certainly done nothing wrong,"" Froome said. ""Of course it has been damaging. As it is right now I'm just happy to draw a line in the sand and move on and focus on bike racing.""
UCI president David Lappartient has also issued a call for calm.
""(Froome) has the right to operate in a safe environment. I have heard calls, sometimes completely irrational, to violence on the Tour de France,"" Lappartient said. ""I cannot accept that and I call on all spectators to protect all the athletes and to respect the judicial decision so that Chris Froome can compete in a safe and serene environment.""
Teammate Geraint Thomas said Froome has shown poise even when fans are at their worst.
""I've always been impressed by the way he is off the bike,"" Thomas said. ""But the last nine months have been the most impressive, really, how he was able to still perform and train and commit to all that while everything else was going on.""
Thomas, however, said possible run-ins with the public are part of riding down roads lined by people, most of who are there to cheer on the athletes.
""It's not like football — it's not in just a closed stadium when you can check everyone,"" he said. ""So there is that element of risk so to speak.""
Froome is aiming to join Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain as the only riders to win the Tour five times.

"The family believed everything Lalit had been saying over the years
For the last 11 years, Lalit Chundawat had been hallucinating about getting instructions from his dead father and kept passing them on to his niece, who noted the messages down in diaries. On Sunday, 11 members of the Chundawat family were found hanging in their house in Delhi's Burari, mouths gagged, hands tied.
The police say 11 diaries found from the house, also being called Delhi's House of Horror, chronicle the messages Lalit Chundawat, 45, dictated over the years. The diaries, which listed how exactly the family members were to hang themselves, also had two entries that may have led the Chundawats to have complete faith in Lalit.
The family believed everything Lalit had been narrating over the years had been coming true, police sources said.
One entry, on June 19, 2015, reads: ""Maine jo kaha tha aaj woh hua hai, aage bhi aise hi karte rehna hai. Vishwaas bana ke rakhna hai (What I had predicted, it has come true today. We have to keep believing)""
The police believe this refers to the financial status of the family. They had a plywood business, and were able to expand from one shop to 11. To achieve that, they had allegedly done exactly what Lalit had asked them to do.
Another factor that might have contributed to them believing Lalit completely, police sources say, is his niece Priyanka's engagement. For a long time the family had been trying to find Priyanka a match, but to little success. Diary entries reveal that Lalit instructed his family to follow certain rituals, following which Priyanka got engaged two weeks ago.Sunday's suicide was meant to be a thanks offering to Lalit's dead father, police sources said, adding that the family members believed they would not die, but be saved at the last moment by Lalit's father's spirit. The last sentence in the final diary, written on the day of the suicides, read: ""...keep water in a cup, when it changes colour, I will appear and save you."" After the ""ritual"", everyone was to untie each other.

"HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh (File Photo) HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh (File Photo)
HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh has said housing finance companies (HFCs) should be permitted to fund developers for affordable housing and help reduce the cost for a homebuyer. Parekh also came down on “lazy housing finance” and batted for compensation when a home loan customer is poached by other firms.
The regulators have not allowed banks and housing finance companies to fund land transactions, yet non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and private equity players are permitted to do so in the past 12 years. “This regulatory arbitrage allows NBFCs and private equity players to levy prohibitively high interest rates on developers borrowing to acquire land,” Parekh said.
“My key question is if NBFCs are allowed to cross over into activities of HFCs, then why can’t HFCs be permitted to fund developers to buy land for affordable housing?” Parekh asked.
According to him, one can understand the RBI’s predicament of not wanting banks at this juncture to fund land transactions. “But the core role of HFCs is to support housing. If HFCs of a certain threshold size are permitted to fund developers to acquire land for affordable housing, then the current high rates are likely to get rationalised. This in turn will help reduce the ultimate cost for a homebuyer,” Parekh said.
“HFCs are well regulated. The National Housing Bank, the regulator for HFCs, understands the nuances and can ensure there is sufficient vigilance to guard against any speculative funding of land transactions,” he said.
Coming out against poaching customers, Parekh said: “The growing practice of housing finance players picking loans off each other’s balance sheet needs to be carefully monitored.” With the regulators prohibiting prepayment charges on most home loans, no one gains in this game, except the agent who keeps collecting commissions. “Lenders do incur costs while originating loans. It is thus logical that there be some compensation to a lender — especially when a customer is poached within a timeframe of say, less than two years,” he said.
“To my mind, regulators should not encourage lazy housing finance,” Parekh said.
Parekh said the single roadblock in the sector today is the cussedness of state governments and local authorities in embracing a transparent process. “…the government has been ahead of the curve in adopting digitisation to make processes more efficient. Yet, one fails to understand the reluctance to put in place an online, time-bound, single-window clearance mechanism for fast-tracking the approvals required for affordable housing,” he said.
Succession planning key agenda, says Parekh
HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh has said succession planning both within HDFC and its group companies is a key agenda. “Personally, the task of ensuring frictionless transitions is and will be on the top of my mind. That said, it is not as if there will be any announcements right away. All the boards of the HDFC group of companies believe that succession planning needs a time frame of 18 to 24 months to ensure a smooth transition,” he said in his letter to shareholders.
“I am confident of the strong pipeline of talent for various functions across all companies within the HDFC group. Yet, positions at the helm require the respective boards and nomination and remuneration committees to evaluate options of both, internal and external candidates,” Parekh said “As passionate and energetic as some of our leaders within the HDFC group are about their jobs, the reality is that individuals do get on in age.”
At HDFC, the board and Keki Mistry have agreed that he will continue in his present capacity as Vice Chairman and CEO for a period of three years, subject to shareholders’ approval, Parekh said. —ENS

However, when till late afternoon there was no movement or sound from inside the house, we broke open the door to find the adults and one child unconscious,” said a neighbour, Sunita Patil.
“We found a soft drink bottle, which prima-facie, has traces of some chemical. We have sent it for forensic test,” the officer added. “It seems to be a case of (attempted) suicide as the family appeared to have drank the cold drink. We have not yet found a note and are investigating why they drank it,” he added.
According to the neighbours, the family didn’t show any sign of being disturbed. “They were out, like all of us, till late into the night. Around midnight, I went to sleep, as did many others,” Sunita Patil said.

"Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is not closed to the idea of selling opium for pharmaceutical use, a senior aide said on Wednesday, a sign of the deep changes the next government is considering in the war on drugs.
MEXICO CITY: Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is not closed to the idea of selling opium for pharmaceutical use, a senior aide said on Wednesday, a sign of the deep changes the next government is considering in the war on drugs.
""Why not sell it to pharmaceutical companies?"" said Olga Sanchez, a former Supreme Court judge who is the incoming president's pick to run the interior ministry.

She said the next president, a 64-year-old former mayor of Mexico City, supported a public consultation on the possibility of regulating opium and decriminalising marijuana.
Lopez Obrador did not take a clear stance on decriminalising drugs before Sunday's election, but says he will try out new approaches to tackling Mexico's violence, including possible amnesty for some cartel employees.
The United States has been engulfed by an epidemic of opioid addiction in recent years that has led to tens of thousands of overdose deaths. The Drug Enforcement Administration says 93 percent of the heroin on U.S. streets is produced in Mexico.
In Mexico, the battle for control of heroin production and trafficking is held partly responsible for the country's record violence, which led to nearly 30,000 murders last year.

Regulation of opium poppy farming for morphine production is a model used in Turkey and India, among other countries, but some experts believe changes in the market thanks to the rise of synthetic opiates make it hard to achieve.
To legally grow and export opium poppies for painkillers, Mexico first would need authorization from the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), a United Nations body.
Lopez Obrador takes office in December. The current government also explored regulating poppy production to make pharmaceutical opiates.
Lopez Obrador upturned Mexico's political status quo in Sunday's election with more than half the country voting for him, and his coalition will have a majority in Congress, projections show, ending 89 years of rule by just two parties.
Sanchez said the newcomers were also exploring decriminalising marijuana for recreational use, saying it no longer made sense for Mexican authorities to engage in a violent struggle against the drug when Canada and several U.S. states had adopted more lenient policies.
""What are we thinking? Tell me. Killing ourselves. Really, keep on killing when ... North America is decriminalising?"" she told W Radio.
Sanchez said any such move would be in parallel to rehabilitation programs and strict punishments for anyone who sold drugs to children.

The regulator has issued the notice under the Sebi Act for alleged violation of Securities Contract Regulation Act (SCRA) and Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices (FUTP), said a source. “Sebi’s investigation report is based on statements of individuals, documents, emails and reports obtained by it,” said the source.
A NSE official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the exchange has received the Sebi notice and is examining it. Phone calls and text messages to Ramakrishnan and Narain did not elicit any response.
Earlier on June 21, Sebi chairman Ajay Tyagi had said the regulator has initiated enforcement action against various institutions and entities in the algorithm trading case. “We have received the NSE investigation report in the co-location case and have initiated enforcement actions,” said Tyagi.

"Japan’s biggest auto-parts supplier has joined the industry chorus warning of disruptions from US President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on cars and components.
Denso Corp, whose US$37 billion market value exceeds Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, sees the threat of US tariffs of as much as 25 per cent and reciprocal levies from trade partners as a “grave concern,” Executive Director Yasushi Matsui said.
The duties are set to hit right as Denso readies an expansion in China, along with a war chest worth at least US$9 billion for investments aimed at broadening its business beyond top customer Toyota Motor Corp.
“A trade war is not the correct course,” Matsui said last week at Denso’s headquarters near Toyota City, about halfway between Tokyo and Osaka. “As long as the rules are free and fair, we have confidence we won’t lose to anyone.”
The US will impose tariffs on US$34 billion of Chinese goods on Friday – unless Trump walks back his hard-line stance – and China will the same day impose countervailing levies on products including car imports from the US.
The Trump administration is also considering additional tariffs of up to 25 per cent on national security grounds, prompting companies from Toyota and General Motors to Continental and Magna International to warn of higher prices for consumers, less investment and fewer jobs.
Denso imports parts from Hong Kong, making the possible levies a direct concern.
The fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement is also a worry because Denso components criss-cross the US-Mexico border multiple times, Matsui said, and the company is currently trying to calculate the potential cost should the agreement get torn up.
Escalating trade friction creates a quandary just as Denso considers spending billions of dollars in acquisitions or investments to procure new technologies and skilled staff aimed at strengthening its position in autonomous driving and vehicle electrification.
Denso could pay as much as a trillion yen (US$9 billion) “in one shot” for the right company, but targets on the scale of tens of billions of yen are more likely, Matsui said.
Denso also aims to increase venture investment to as much as 10 billion yen (US$90.5 million) annually, he said.
Denso sees the maturing of automated-driving and electric-car technologies as a chance to increase its customer base.
From near-total dependence on Toyota in those areas now, Denso aims to have 20 per cent to 30 per cent of business related to automated driving from outside Toyota by 2020, Matsui said.",www.scmp.com,2018-07-05 03:16:24,12,501236
"Sheena was allegedly murdered on April 24, 2012, by Indrani, along with her former husband, Sanjeev Khanna and driver-turned-approver, Shyamvar Rai, in conspiracy with her media-baron husband, Peter Mukerjea. Sheena was allegedly murdered on April 24, 2012, by Indrani, along with her former husband, Sanjeev Khanna and driver-turned-approver, Shyamvar Rai, in conspiracy with her media-baron husband, Peter Mukerjea.
In the Sheena Bora murder case, Angele Chung, the owner of a beauty parlour in Worli, who deposed in the court on Wednesday, said Indrani Mukerjea visited the parlour hours before the alleged murder. Chung told the court that Indrani, the main accused in the case, took an appointment for 10.30 am on April 24, 2012. She left after nearly one-and-a-half hours, Chung told the court.
The CBI claims Sheena’s murder took place the same evening. Chung told the court that she knew Indrani for 10-12 years as she was a regular customer. She identified Indrani in the courtroom. Sheena was allegedly murdered on April 24, 2012, by Indrani, along with her former husband, Sanjeev Khanna and driver-turned-approver, Shyamvar Rai, in conspiracy with her media-baron husband, Peter Mukerjea.
Another witness, a garage-owner, Mohammed Syed Riyaz, told the court Wednesday that Rai had brought a car for cleaning to him on April 25, 2012. According to CBI, Indrani, Khanna and Rai had, in the wee hours of April 25, allegedly, dumped Sheena’s body in Raigad district. After their return, Rai had gone to the garage to get the car cleaned.
Riyaz told the court Rai had come through the reference of one Raja, whom Riyaz had paid a commission. Rai reached the garage in Worli Sea Face at 11am and asked for an Optra car to be polished and cleaned. Asked by Indrani’s defence advocate, Sudeep Pasbola, if Riyaz had seen blood in the car, he replied in the negative. Riyaz also told the court that he had not seen Rai after that day.

Lucknow University was closed and the admission process suspended till further orders after a group of youths allegedly assaulted the proctor and a dozen teachers and staff on campus Wednesday afternoon. Three of the attackers were arrested while a case was lodged against several others at Hasanganj Police Station.
The attack took place around 500 metres from an ongoing hunger strike by undergraduate students who were denied admission to the varsity’s PG courses, near Vice-Chancellor S P Singh’s office. The V-C said that the youths tried to attack him and alleged that the attackers were outsiders, who claimed to be affiliated to the Samajwadi Party.
A few hours after the attack, 15 protesters participating in the hunger strike, including Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha leader Pooja Shukla, were detained. Police are probing whether the attack was linked to the protest.
SP (Trans-Gomti) Harendra Kumar said, “Around 1.30 pm, a few teachers and the proctor were standing around 500 metres from the dharna when a group of youths arrived and attacked them. The group tried to intercept the V-C’s car, but the driver somehow managed to take the car out. The youths assaulted the teachers and proctor and hit them with stones.”
“Policemen on campus rushed to the spot and caught two of the youths — identified as Ayush Kumar and Ankit Singh — while they were trying to escape. The two are former students of the university. Ashish Mishra alias Boxer, another ex-student, was also arrested later,” he said.

Mahanagar Circle Officer (CO) Anurag Singh said 15 protesters were later detained. “These include Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha leader Pooja Shukla… For now, they are at the Gosaiganj police station.”
Pooja Shukla claimed she had nothing to do with the attack and she would continue her hunger strike.
Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha state president Digvijay Singh said, “Anyone can come and claim anything. None of those arrested or named belong to the Chhatra Sabha.”
Asked about the hunger strike, V-C Singh said, “If someone does not fall under the rules, how can we allow them admission?”

"Donald Trump's spelling mistakes in tweets have been quite regular leading to confusion
Donald Trump has goofed up once again. The US President who gave us the infamous covfefe went on another round of self-praising and boasting about his writing skills in a tweet. But it all backlashed when he made a spelling error in the tweet. Instead of ""pore over"" he wrote ""pour over"" and later corrected the tweet making author JK Rowling burst out in fits of laughter.
The other error was the word bestselling, which is either one word or hyphenated however Mr Trump made it two words which made his self-praising not only questionable but also laughable.
The original tweet was edited and the ""pour over"" spelling changed after around 2 hours but not before everyone had a good laugh at the President's narcissism.
After having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pore over my tweets looking for a mistake. I capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized! - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2018
Ms Rowling found the original tweet hilarious, repeatedly typing ""haha"" in three successive replies. In one, the Harry Potter books' author sarcastically called him the ""Gratest Writer on earth."" She also gave him the correct spelling of the word.
After Mr Trump corrected his tweet, JK Rowling tweeted again saying someone told him the correct meaning of the word.
*wipes eyes, tries to control breathing*
Seriously, @realDonaldTrump is the Gratest Writer on earth. - J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) July 3, 2018
Many other Twitter users also trolled Mr Trump including the Merriam-Webster dictionary who posted the correct meaning of the word.

'pour over' ""to make expensive coffee""

The bank said it has embarked upon a credit restructuring exercise that will ensure that large accounts and lending operations are concentrated in a few specially designated branches.
Punjab National Bank has started shifting most of its the borrowal accounts above Rs 50 crore to over 60 branches across the country, which are being turned into Systemically Important Branches (SIBs), the bank said Wednesday. The bank said it has embarked upon a credit restructuring exercise that will ensure that large accounts and lending operations are concentrated in a few specially designated branches.
“Creation of these branches will not only mean better servicing of these accounts but will also ensure better checks and balances over large accounts. The bank is in the process of shifting most of the large accounts to SIBs,” the bank said. Apart from these SIBs, most of the bigger accounts will be operated from branches designated as Large Corporate Branches (LCBs) while regular branches will concentrate on regular accounts.
The state-owned lender started rejigging its branch operations and is in recovery mode after it was hit by a loan scandal over Rs 14,000 crore in February which originated in a single mid-corporate Brady House branch. The bank will designate two to three branches as SIBs in metropolitan cities depending upon geographical convenience.
The bank said it has no plans to close operations in branches like the Brady House branch. “Reallocation of some of the accounts is part of the restructuring process aimed at centralization of critical functions and large corporate accounts. Retail operations for PNB customers continue to operate from the branches like Brady House,” it said.
PNB posted a net loss of Rs 13,416.91 crore for the January-March quarter, the biggest ever by any domestic lender.

"Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has defended the country's new social media tax, saying Ugandans were using such platforms for ""lying"", and squandering the nation's hard currency on fees to foreign-owned telecoms firms.
KAMPALA: Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has defended the country's new social media tax, saying Ugandans were using such platforms for ""lying"", and squandering the nation's hard currency on fees to foreign-owned telecoms firms.
In May Uganda's parliament passed new tax laws that introduced a levy of 200 shillings (US$0.05) per day for access to a range of online services.
Advertisement
The platforms that have been identified by the country's revenue service for the tax include Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Google Hangouts, YouTube, Skype, Yahoo Messenger and many others.
The tax, collected by mobile phone internet service providers since July 1, is equivalent to about 20 percent of what typical Ugandan users pay for their mobile phone data plans.
In a statement on Twitter, Museveni described social media as a ""luxury by those who are enjoying themselves or those who are malicious...all the moral reasons are in favour of that tax.""
Ugandan social media users, he said, were ""endlessly donating money to foreign telephone companies through chatting or even lying.""

Uganda's two biggest telecom firms are owned by South Africa's MTN Group and India's Bharti Airtel, while other small players are also mostly foreign-owned.
The tax has proven extremely unpopular with Ugandan mobile phone users, who say it is unfair and stifles free speech.
""The tax is an absolute insult to Ugandans...we already buy data which the government taxes, why should we again have to pay this money to government to access these platforms?"" said Dickens Kamugisha, a Kampala-based charity worker.
""And in any case these are now essential communications channels that people use to reach loved ones, communicate with friends, socialise and mobilise civically...the tax reflects the highest form of greed.""
This week Amnesty International called on the government to scrap the tax, which it called an attempt to smother dissent disguised as a measure to raise revenue.
In power since 1986, Museveni, 73, has come under increasing criticism from local and international rights groups who accuse him of using security forces to clamp down on the opposition and other critics.
Last year parliament, controlled by the ruling party, amended the country's constitution and removed a 75-year age cap for presidential candidates. The opposition says the move effectively cleared the way for him to be president for life.
In the past officials have expressed anger at the use of social media to post content critical of the government and some social media users have faced criminal charges over such posts.
There has also been anger over a new tax on all transactions on Mobile Money, a popular platform used widely in Uganda and across East Africa to transmit cash between individuals and pay for goods and services.
In the statement Museveni said there had been a ""miscommunication"" and that the levy would be 0.5 percent of the value of transactions, not 1 percent passed by parliament.

"TASHKENT: A court in Uzbekistan convicted an Uzbek-born U.S. citizen for links to militant Islam and calling for the government's overthrow, but imposed only a US$67 fine for the almost 20-year-old offences.
Zokir Aliyev, 46, an American citizen since 2014, was detained on June 16 by Uzbekistan's state security service on suspicion of belonging to an Islamist militant group.

He was freed after six days in detention and then stood trial in the former Soviet republic that has traditionally been tough on Islamists after an insurgency in the 1990s.
The Uzbek Supreme Court's press office said on Wednesday that a provincial court had convicted Aliyev of publicly calling for the toppling of the government and participating in an extremist group.
But it said the court imposed only the small fine based on a multiple of the official minimum wage as of December 1999 when the alleged offence occurred.
No further explanation was given. But the Uzbek criminal code says the punishment for such offences can be as mild as a fine, or a fine plus prison time.

Aliyev, who could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, earlier denied any involvement with the militant Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) and said he had only taken part in some Uzbek opposition activist meetings in Turkey in the 1990s.
Uzbekistan's state security service said via the state news agency UzA last month that Aliyev had been on its wanted list since 2005 over suspected affiliation with the IMU.
IMU fighters fought alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan after retreating from their home country and the intelligence service told UzA they suspected Aliyev had trained there.
According to what appears to be Aliyev's Facebook page, which gives his name as Zokir Ali, he has lived recently in the U.S. state of Virginia and studied at the University of Nevada.
The U.S. embassy in Tashkent declined comment on his case, citing privacy concerns.

"Gol Masjid on Anandilal Podar Road. Karma Sonam Bhutia Gol Masjid on Anandilal Podar Road. Karma Sonam Bhutia
ANANDILAL Podar Road in south Mumbai that stretches from Marine Lines station to the Metro Cinema junction is home to an iconic hundred-year-old Parsi bakery, a Masjid curiously located in the middle of a busy road, and a cinema house, originally built by a Hollywood studio.
The road that was once called the 1st Marine Street — a name still visible on some shop hoardings — was recently in the news after a section of the road caved in following heavy rain on June 25. The road was repaired urgently, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi due to visit the city the following day. Anandilal Podar was known to have contributed to the freedom movement and towards education.
Hailing from Nawalgarh in Rajasthan, Podar, in 1921, established the Anandilal Education Society, now called Anandilal Podar Trust, with Mahatma Gandhi as its first chairman trustee. City historian Deepak Rao says: “He was known to have contributed towards getting people educated. His family continued the work done by him. Hence, there are several educational institutes and hospitals in his and his family’s name.” Right at the beginning of the road is the Metro INOX theatre, built in 1938 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), the Hollywood studio. Rao says: “The Parsis residing in the area were not too happy with an American studio movie theatre. Only Hollywood movies played there. There were massive protests by the community at the time. Eventually, the movie theatre was purchased by someone else in 1970 after which Bollywood movies started playing there.” As one walks further, there is Gol Masjid, oddly positioned in the middle.
Imam Israel Ahmed from the Masjid says: “The Masjid was first formally opened here in 1958 though it had stood here a good 10-12 years before that.” Mehboob Khan, another person, who has served the Masjid all his life, says the road is a poignant symbol of religious harmony. “There is a very popular sight of how we were doing our jumma prayers outside the mosque, and from one of the side road, a Ganesh statue was being taken for puja. The road often sees large crowds coming to pray at the Masjid, sometimes stretching right down the road till Metro Cinema.” Khan adds how he “remembers former Maharashtra Chief Minister Abdul Rehman Antulay would visit the Masjid, especially during Eid, even when he was Chief Minister.”
Rao says that when the structure of the mosque first came up, it was not in the middle of the road. “When the mosque came up, there were five old structures on the left side. The stretch of the road to the right of the mosque was the only one to travel. But not many vehicles passed by that spot hence it wasn’t a problem. However, a few years after the mosque came up, the five buildings had to be demolished thereby placing the mosque in the middle of the road like a traffic island,” Rao said. Further down is Walter D’Souza garden named after the hockey player who represented India at Olympics. A few metres away on the opposite side is the 105-year-old Irani Cafe Sassanian Boulangerie. The cafe was started by Rustom Yazdabadi in 1913, Sassanian was in 1947 taken over by the Kola family later. “The pride of place the cafe enjoys can be seen from the celebrations that took place when the it completed 100 years in 2013,” Rao adds.

Report: ""Current exploration levels are certainly a far cry from the $653.8 million spent in 2011, the last time coal prices were at present levels"".
BOOMING coal prices have failed to lure explorers back to Queensland, according to the State Government.
The government's mining journal said record and near record coal prices had been reached over most of past the year, but coal exploration expenditure in Queensland remained ""fairly subdued'' at only $99 million for the 12 months to March.
""Current exploration levels are certainly a far cry from the $653.8 million spent in 2011, the last time coal prices were at present levels,'' it said.
The spending was up on the $82.1 million spent for the same period in 2017, ""suggesting that many explorers are still struggling to recover from the effects of the poor prices of late 2015 and early 2016.
""While global coal demand fell marginally for the first time in decades in 2015, largely on the back of major structural changes in China, 2016 saw a significant proportion of this demand gradually come back on line.
Coal mining industry has failed to lure explorers back to Queensland.
""Some analysts predict the international thermal coal market to grow by almost 50 million tonnes, or 5 per cent, in 2018, based on new power station construction, particularly in South and East Asia.
""Imports to India in particular are anticipated to rise again after falling in the last two years as domestic supply there struggles to meet expanding demand.''
Investment in the Queensland mining since the beginning of 2016 appears to have stabilised at around $2 billion a quarter.
Total investment in the year to March 2018 was $8.7 billion, up from $7.96 billion expended in the 12 months ended March 2017.
Copper exploration expenditure in Queensland jumped 65 per cent in the year to March at $53.9 million compared with the previous year's $32.7 million, but this is still only a third of levels seen in 2011 and 2012.
Gold exploration expenditure in Queensland was also up strongly for the March year at $61.8 million, an increase of 20 per cent.
This was still well down on the $75.2 million achieved in the 12-month period ended September 2013.",www.dailyexaminer.com.au,2018-07-05 03:07:36,15,692337

The Supreme Court Wednesday held that the concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor was not required for decisions taken by the Delhi Council of Ministers. This is in contrast to the judgment of the Delhi High Court, which had ruled in 2016 that the L-G’s concurrence was a must, and that he was the administrative head of the national capital.
How the two judgments approached some of the issues:
Article 239AA
While dealing with Article 239AA, which grants Special Status to Delhi among UTs, HC had said that the position of the L-G was different from governors of states, and that the L-G may act in his discretion with regard to all matters in respect of which he is required to act in his discretion “by or under any law”.
SC held that Delhi cannot be accorded status of a state but added that L-G has no “independent decision-making power” and has to act on the aid and advice of the elected government.
Transaction of business rules
On the Transaction of Business of the Government of NCT of Delhi Rules, 1993, the HC said it was always open to the L-G to “differ with the decision of the Council of Ministers, in which event, he has to follow the procedure as prescribed” under rules.
The Supreme Court said the L-G must work “harmoniously” with the ministers and not seek to “resist them every step of the way”. It said that barring issues of public order, police and land Delhi Assembly had powers to make laws on all other subjects.
Contentious issues
The High Court bench had held the appointment of commissions by AAP government to probe the alleged CNG fitness scam and alleged irregularities in the Delhi and District Cricket Association as illegal, saying they were done without the L-G’s concurrence. SC said all contentious issues would be deliberated on by the apex court’s smaller benches, on the basis of the SC verdict.

Even agri-chemical, pesticides and fertiliser manufacturing companies saw a jump in share prices on expectations of higher spending by farmers because of the increase in income.
Following the Centre’s move to hike the minimum support price (MSP) for paddy by Rs 200 per quintal Wednesday, shares of companies related to the agriculture sector jumped by up to 15 per cent.
The MSP announcement also resulted in gains for the broader market as the benchmark Sensex at the Bombay Stock Exchange rose by nearly 200 points after the announcement came and closed the day with gains of 0.75 per cent or 266 points at 35,645.
While shares of Kohinoor Foods jumped 15.6 per cent during the day, it closed with a gain of 12.96 per cent. Similarly LT Foods, which owns the Daawat rice brand, also saw its share price jump 9.4 per cent after the announcement, before closing with a gain of 7.1 per cent.
The promoter of a leading rice exporting company said that the jump in share price may be driven by sentiments and will be temporary. “I think that the market perceives that rice exporting companies may earn higher income on their existing inventory and thus make higher profits. However, that may be temporary,” the promoter said.
Even agri-chemical, pesticides and fertiliser manufacturing companies saw a jump in share prices on expectations of higher spending by farmers because of the increase in income.
While the share of PI Industries jumped 7 per cent during the day, Coromandel International rose by 4 per cent. Deepak Fertilisers and GNFC also gained up to 3.5 per cent and 2.7 per cent.
“Rural income and spending power will increase due to higher minimum price and the progressing monsoon may result in higher demand for consumption-oriented stocks,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.
Shares of two and three-wheeler manufacturers and FMCG companies also rose after the announcement. Shares of Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company closed with gains of 4 per cent and 3.9 per cent while the share price of Hindustan Unilever closed with gains of 2 per cent on Wednesday.

Identification of RRBs requiring recapitalisation and the amount of capital will be decided in consultation with National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.
To ensure financial stability of Regional Rural Banks, the Cabinet Wednesday approved extension of recapitalisation scheme for RRBs for next three years up to 2019-20 to help them maintain their minimum capital adequacy ratio. The scheme started in 2010-11 and was extended twice in 2012-13 and 2015-16. The last extension was up to March, 2017.
Rs 1,107.20 crore, as government’s share, out of Rs 1,450 crore, has been released to RRBs till March last year. The remaining Rs 342.80 crore will be utilised to provide recapitalisation support to RRBs whose Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio is below 9 per cent, during 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20.
“A strong capital structure and minimum required level of CRAR will ensure financial stability of RRBs which will enable them to play a greater role in financial inclusion and meeting the credit requirements of rural areas,” the statement said.

"Former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India K C Chakrabarty Former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India K C Chakrabarty
Former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India K C Chakrabarty has come under the CBI scanner in connection with a loan default case involving a Delhi-based travel company, Airworth Travels and Tours Private Limited.
The company had allegedly availed more than Rs 41 crore in loans from the Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) by fraudulent means and willfully defaulted on it by diverting the funds.
In May, Chakrabarty, who served as the Deputy Governor of the RBI between 2009 and 2014, was stopped from travelling to London from Mumbai airport after the CBI issued a look out circular against him.
The look out circular was issued in connection with an FIR registered against Airworth Travels and Tours Private Limited, its promoters and “unnamed public servants”.
Although the FIR registered in the case did not name Chakrabarty, the CBI questioned him twice in April in connection with the case. A CBI official said Chakrabarty is likely to be called for questioning again.
“There is suspicion that he has played a role in grant of loans to the travel company. That is why he is being questioned,” a source, privy to the matter, said.
In a letter to the CBI last month, Chakrabarty had sought withdrawal of the look out circular so that he could return to London. He has also written to the CBI claiming innocence.
“Chakrabarty was first summoned in December last year, but he appeared before CBI only in April this year. That is why a look out circular has been issued against him,” an official said.
The FIR was registered against the directors of Airworth Travels and Tours Private Limited — Gaurav Mehra and Sonila Mehra — and unknown IOB officials, on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and fabrication of documents. It is alleged that they hatched criminal conspiracy and siphoned off sanctioned credit limit and bank guarantee by submitting fabricated financial statements for availing these facilities.

"Ashok Wadia, principal of HR College, said: “Applicants are coming to us everyday seeking clarity on the situation. But the decision lies with the government so, we don’t have a definite answer for such students.” Ashok Wadia, principal of HR College, said: “Applicants are coming to us everyday seeking clarity on the situation. But the decision lies with the government so, we don’t have a definite answer for such students.”
WITH ADMISSIONS to degree colleges on hold, confusion continues among aspirants seeking admissions to colleges under the University of Mumbai. With the new session already delayed by a week, and no resolution in sight, candidates, as well as colleges are beginning to panic.
What is the current status of admissions?
Admission to colleges affiliated to the University of Mumbai began on May 31. On June 19, the first merit list was announced. Students were admitted to colleges thereafter and a second merit list was expected on June 22. However, on June 21, the state education minister announced a stay on admissions to degree colleges across Maharashtra until further notice. Since then, neither has the university announced its merit lists, nor have colleges admitted any more students. Students, on the other hand, are left confused.
Why were admissions stayed?
This year, the university had changed its admission process and eliminated reservations for backward category students in accordance with a Bombay High Court order. The court had, in November 2017, ordered that minority colleges, which have a 50 per cent reservation for students belonging to a minority community, would not have reservations for SC/ ST and OBC category students. The order referred to a 2005 constitutional amendment that exempts minority institutions from reservations. According to Article 15 (5) of the Constitution of India, minority institutions under Article 30 shall be exempt from constitutional reservations — an amendment inserted by the then Congress government. So, this year, when the university issued a circular stating that minority colleges would not have any seat reserved for SC/ST/DT/NT/OBC students, student organisations protested and demanded reservations. Giving in to the pressure from student organisations, the government decided to move the Supreme Court against the Bombay High Court order.
What is the government planning to do?
The state government has filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court challenging the Bombay High Court’s November ruling. The SLP is yet to come up for hearing. Meanwhile, admissions remain held up. A senior official from the higher and technical education department told The Indian Express that the SLP is likely to come up for hearing within a week and a decision would be taken thereafter.
How does the stay affect students and colleges?
Students are currently unclear about their admission status. Those who have already secured admissions are unclear whether or not their admissions would be valid when the admission process resumes. “If there is any change in the seats, the merit lists will change. At the moment there is no clarity,” said a candidate who has confirmed her admission in a suburban college after the first merit list. For those who haven’t been allotted seats yet, there is no clarity. “There are many students who apply from outside Maharashtra. They, along with their parents, camp in Mumbai until admissions are over. Right now, they don’t know what the future holds or how long the process would take,” said a principal of a college on the condition of anonymity. Ashok Wadia, principal of HR College, said: “Applicants are coming to us everyday seeking clarity on the situation. But the decision lies with the government so, we don’t have a definite answer for such students.” Meanwhile, the academic calendar is already delayed by a week. “While usually we start classes by June 25, the second merit list is yet to be announced. We don’t even know how long it will take to resolve the issue. The whole year will suffer and vacations will have to be cut,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal of KC College, where applicants have found a smart way around the uncertainty. “Students who studied in our junior college have all opted for the inhouse quota for BCom. All our B Com seats are full now,” she said.

The government has decided to “wait and watch” for the next three-four months before taking a call on disinvestment of national carrier Air India due to prevalent market condition specially high fuel prices, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday. The government’s proposed stake sale in Air India failed to attract any initial bidder when the deadline for bidding ended on May 31. The minister said given the high fuel prices at present, the viability of the move will be judged before going ahead with the disinvestment process.
“Market condition is not right for Air India disinvestment now. In view of this we are keeping a wait and watch policy for the next three to four months,” Gadkari said, as per a PTI report. As per the Air India disinvestment plan, the government had offered to sell 76 per cent stake in the national carrier along with complete stake sale of low-cost arm Air India Express and sale of its 50 per cent stake in Air India SATS Airport Services Pvt Ltd, which is an equal joint venture with Singapore-based SATS.
At the end of March 2017, Air India a debt burden of around Rs 48,877 crore. Of the total amount, Rs 17,360 crore was related to aircraft and Rs 31,517 crore pertained to working capital loans. In May, Air India’s market share stood at 12.8 per cent.
Meanwhile, in a relief to the national carrier, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved approved a proposal to enhance the expenditure for operation and maintenance of Air India’s VVIP aircraft to Rs 534.38 crore plus taxes for 2016-17, from Rs 336.24 crore which was fixed in October 2011. Air India engages the ‘Special Extra Section Flights’ (SESF) or VVIP aircraft such as the Boeing B747-400 for the President, the Vice President and the Prime Minister. The costs on account of these flights are reimbursed to Air India by the respective ministries.
The CCEA has given its approval to enhance the expenditure for Air India’s “SESF operations from Rs336.24 crore plus applicable taxes to Rs.534.38 crore plus applicable taxes for 2016-17 with built-in annual escalation of 10% to compensate the cost of living index and exchange fluctuation for the maintenance of B747-400 aircraft,” the government said in a statement.
Since the last revision in October 2011 in fixed maintenance costs, there has been a substantial increase in the expenditure incurred by Air India on maintenance of these aircraft because of increase in the cost of living index, depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar and increase in the material cost, the statement said.
“It is therefore necessary to review the estimates/ reimbursements provided to Air India since the year 2011-12 as the cost base has not been indexed to inflation. Since, AI is suffering financial losses, the airline cannot afford to provide any services below its cost,” it said.

"The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) on Wednesday issued revised norms to initiate insolvency resolution process, paving way for homebuyers to seek relief as financial creditors and allowing conditional withdrawal of insolvency applications, among other key changes.
The regulator put in place timeframes to be adopted by resolution professionals (RPs) and stipulated that an RP should assess whether a corporate debtor had indeed indulged in fraudulent transactions within a time-line during the resolution process.
The changes to the IBBI (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) regulations were necessitated after the government had issued an ordinance last month amending the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The changes will provide more clarity on procedural requirements for various classes of creditors, including homebuyers.
“Wherever the corporate debtor has classes of creditors having at least ten creditors in the class, the interim resolution professional shall offer a choice of three insolvency professionals… to act as the authorised representative of creditors in each class.
“… The insolvency professional, who is the choice of the highest number of creditors in the class, shall be appointed as the authorised representative of creditors of the respective class,” an official release said. —FE

"Limitation in GSTN functionalities, poor IT connectivity and multiple return filing requirements have caused initial challenges for business and tax authorities.
GST has dismantled inter-state trade barriers and converted India into a unified market of 1.3 billion citizens. With the government placing emphasis on curbing black money, GST can significantly complement this effort, being less intrusive, more self-policing, and hence a more effective way of reducing malpractices and rent-seeking.
Incentive schemes, devised as a tool to attract investment by state governments by granting tax exemptions, have been found unsuitable under GST, prompting the government to move to an alternate scheme in the form of cash refund. The Union government too has dispensed with the area-bases exemption schemes. This resulted in elimination of mushrooming exemptions, tax cascading and the tax induced distortions.
The GST revenue trend largely has been in line with the expectations. Indications of April-May’18 promise a monthly GST mop-up touching Rs 100,000 crore in the current fiscal year. The GDP’s GST dividend, estimated at 2%, appears a far-cry as things stand now; however, Q4FY18 and Q1FY19 figures indicate things could get better.
The elimination of the multi-layered indirect tax structure, introduction of uniform GST rates across the country and GST registration, which facilitates cross verification of income tax returns, have the potential for increasing compliance in the coming times. Invoice matching (still in nascent stage) has driven the parallel economy to join the national mainstream. Over 40 lakh new taxpayers have obtained registration under GST to avail benefit of input tax credit and to levy GST on supplies. The number of return filers and collections under income tax also have shown significant increase, of 26% and 17%, respectively.
Limitation in GSTN functionalities, poor IT connectivity and multiple return filing requirements have caused initial challenges for business and tax authorities. The government, with a view to address the apprehensions of the business, proactively relaxed the return filing process. However, this in turn necessitated suspension of credit matching and return validation process, which formed the fundamental pillar on which the GST roll-out plan was based.
Simple periodic filing procedure is an essential feature of any simple tax regime. The government has been quick to notice this deficiency; corrective actions are on the anvil, and it is expected that the revised, simpler filing process would be implemented towards the third quarter of the current fiscal year. Certainty is the cornerstone of a sound tax form. Divergence in views among Advance Ruling Authorities calls for suitable alternate mechanism. Leaving out genuine business expenditures (rent-a-cab, employee insurance, food and beverage, construction, etc) from input tax chain doesn’t augur well, especially as the stated objective is to remove tax cascading. Issuance of administrative instructions and circulars conflicting with statutory provisions and time-tested principles would dwindle the confidence of the business community. This requires urgent attention of the policy makers.
Follow-up actions are required to consolidate the gains and address the concerns of the stake-holders. Convergence of four-tier GST rate slabs into three by merging 12% and 18%, would help reduce dispute on classification, tax rate and check evasion. It is the appropriate time to examine the need of integrating petroleum and power sectors into GST. Energy, petroleum (transport fuel), construction and real estate, textile, fertiliser industries and exporters are reeling under inefficient input tax credit mechanism, archaic valuation rules, inverted tax rates, delayed refunds, etc, and that requires immediate attention.
The government deserves compliments for the bold initiative to introduce this much-delayed fiscal reform. Course-corrections would act as a catalyst in achieving the aspiration of taking India to the first 50 countries in ‘Ease of Doing Business’.

"Police forces in four countries on Wednesday seized some 25,000 Greek and Roman archaeological items worth over 40 million euros (US$46 million) in predawn raids, cracking down on illegal trafficking in cultural goods.
Some 250 officers in Italy, Spain, Britain and Germany simultaneously swooped in on 40 houses – the culmination of a four-year investigation led by the Italians, the European police agency said.
In Italy, the raids were focused on the regions of Sicily, Calabria, Piedmont and Apulia, in what is considered one of the biggest crackdowns in such crimes in Italian history.
Prosecutors believe the items were illegally excavated in Sicily, under commission by a London art dealer.
In the Sicilian Caltanissetta area, “which is rich in archaeological sites from the Greek and Roman epochs, local members of the organised crime group illegally excavated artefacts,” Europol said.
The items were then smuggled out of Italy, “equipped with false provenances and sold via German auction houses.”
Facilitators in Barcelona and London helped organise the “supply chain” and provided technical support.
Police also seized 1,500 tools, including metal detectors, in the early morning raids.
Major Luigi Mancuso of the Carabinieri paramilitary art squad in Palermo, Italy, said Wednesday that investigators allege that the digs were commissioned by a London art dealer, William Veres, 64, who was served with an international warrant.
“International cooperation is key to the success of such investigations in the field of trafficking of cultural goods, in which artefacts are moved through several EU countries and levels before they are brought to the legal market,” Europol added.",www.scmp.com,2018-07-05 02:56:46,9,501140

Tripura Police on Wednesday said four personnel were suspended as it progressed in the investigation into the lynching of an announcer hired by authorities to dispel rumours.
Sukanta Chakraborty (33) was lynched by a mob on June 28 in a crowded market in Kalachhara area of South Tripura after a few youths confronted the government announcement team and said they did not know the “real” situation in the villages where “child abductors were really present”.
“Four personnel have been suspended pending enquiry. Two policemen and two TSR (Tripura State Rifles) personnel,” KV Sreejesh, Inspector General of Police (law and order), told The Indian Express over phone.

Asked whether the suspension was due to alleged inaction of security personnel on the spot, Sreejesh said, “That we can say only after inquiry. It will be premature to comment now. Prima facie there were some doubts so this inquiry…”
It is learnt from sources that the four personnel were in the vicinity at the time of the incident but they could not control the mob after the altercation. The TSR participates in counter-insurgency operations and assists the police in maintaining law and order.
Identifying the two policemen as a constable and an assistant sub-inspector, a police officer said, “They were not adequately armed because no one could fathom such a thing could happen on that day — it’s not election time or anything and it was a market place not an interior area.”

"The AAP government Wednesday announced it was expediting implementation of key projects it had promised the city.(Representational Image) The AAP government Wednesday announced it was expediting implementation of key projects it had promised the city.(Representational Image)
Within hours of the Supreme Court ruling that the Delhi government does not need the concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor for its decisions but has to only keep him posted, the AAP government Wednesday announced it was expediting implementation of key projects it had promised the city. Until Wednesday evening, the office of the Lt-Governor had made no comment.
To make up for what Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia called “two years that were wasted”, the AAP cabinet met at the Delhi Secretariat at 4 pm and issued directions to immediately speed up two delayed projects: doorstep delivery of ration and installation of CCTV cameras.
“Now that the obstructions that the Lt-Governor had been imposing on the two schemes have been removed, we have issued orders to implement them immediately,” said Sisodia. Promises ranging from setting up 1,000 mohalla clinics by 2017-18 to regularisation of guest teachers had helped the party rise to power. “But for nearly two years, an obstructionist Lt-Governor, following instructions of the Modi government, slowed down the rate of development. This will change now,” he said.
Referring to the Supreme Court ruling, he said the bench had “clarified” that the Lt-Governor hasn’t “been entrusted with any independent decision-making power” and while rules say that cabinet decisions need to be “communicated” to the Lt-Governor, this does “not mean that concurrence… is required”.
The two schemes for
which directions were issued Wednesday, the AAP said, was just the tip of the iceberg. On the key promise of mohalla clinics, only 164 mohalla clinics exist. In the outcome Budget it presented in May, the AAP government revised its target to 530 clinics for the next financial year.
According to the government, the Delhi Cabinet had approved a health insurance scheme with the aim of providing citizens a reliable option to meet medical expenses, and sent the file for approval in June 2016. But that proposal, it claimed, was “virtually rejected” by the Lt-Governor.
On education, the government failed to meet its target of creating 54 model schools this year — only 19 are functional. On regularising guest teachers, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal accused the L-G of “opposing” the Bill to regularise guest teachers — the Lt-Governor had said that ‘services’ was under his purview.
“With schools or clinics, there are two problems. There is shortage of land since DDA is the land-owning agency. But with guest teachers, it was simply a matter of the Lt-Governor saying teachers provided services, so it was a service matter,” said an AAP leader. Sisodia said the court verdict made it “clear” that services had been restored to the government.
Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, who was one of the Delhi government’s lawyers in the case, came out in support of Kejriwal and targeted the BJP: “Why did the L-G (with a fine track record) allow himself to be misdirected in law by his political masters?… The present controversy was manufactured by the BJP and the central government. Now, happily resolved by the Constitutional Court.” The judgment, Chidambaram said, “contains important lessons for Puducherry”.

Two persons were rescued in Manipur after being assaulted in separate incidents by local residents who suspected them to be child-lifters, police said on Wednesday, even as fake news about the two being cannibals was circulated both on social media and sections of mainstream media.
The two — a local from Imphal (West) district and an outsider whose identity was yet to be ascertained — were assaulted in two villages around 12 km apart in Kangpokpi district on Tuesday and are being treated at a local hospital.
Sections of the media reported that “two people from Assam were arrested in Manipur over charges of cannibalism”.
The police said the two appeared to be mentally unsound. “This is completely false news. There is no cannibalism involved. The two appear to be mentally unsound but they are not cannibals,” Kangpokpi SP Hemant Pandey told The Indian Express over phone.
A psychiatric test would be conducted on the two on Thursday and they are in preventive custody, the police said. The second person is unable to properly identify himself.
“There is no missing person report of any child in this district for the last three months,” Pandey said. He said rumours about child-abductors were doing the rounds in the district for over a month now.

"Asmita’s husband Luv at the hospital. Tabassum Barnagarwala Asmita’s husband Luv at the hospital. Tabassum Barnagarwala
AS Asmita Katkar (35) battled for her life on Tuesday after being pulled out from the debris of a collapsed road overbridge in Andheri, a team of over 15 doctors at the municipal Dr RN Cooper hospital conducted multiple surgeries over a span of 14 hours, not only salvaging her left hand but also stabilising her medical parameters by Wednesday.
Employed as a domestic help, Asmita had suffered an intracranial bleed, a crushed face and multiple minor injuries. She was unresponsive when taken to the government hospital at 9.29 am, two hours after the collapse. The neurosurgery, plastic surgery, ENT, anaesthesia, orthopaedics, and general surgery departments operated on her from 12.30 pm Tuesday till 3 am Wednesday.
At 8 am on Tuesday, a message was sent to all doctors at Cooper hospital to expect mass casualties. At that point, head of the ENT department Dr Shashikant Mhashal had left home from Sion but was stuck in traffic. “At Milan subway I finally left my cab and took a lift from a biker to reach the hospital,” he said. Between 9.15 am and 9.29 am, all five injured were admitted. While others were stabilised, Katkar had a broken jaw and a damaged airway. Her left hand was dangling from the elbow. Doctors tried to insert an air tube intra-orally but the bleeding from her jaw made that impossible. “It was a miracle she was surviving, fighting to breathe, even two hours after the accident. We conducted a tracheostomy to create an airway to breathe,” said Dr Vinod Gite, assistant professor in ENT. Gite has earlier worked in KEM hospital.
As Gite and Mhashal, with nine and 12 years of experience, respectively, conducted the tracheostomy, a team of eight doctors from anaesthesia department inserted a central line to stabilise her while orthopaedics started cleaning her wounds. By 10.30 am, the first CT scan was conducted. Her neurological status did not seem critical. The intracranial bleeding had not affected other regions of the brain, neurosurgeon Dr Shraddha Maheshwari, assistant professor in neurosurgery, said. So, doctors focussed on salvaging her hand and reconstructing her face.
Mhashal and Gite sutured her right cheek and did a basic surgery to realign her jaw. “In my experience, survival is minimal. But in her case, she was brought at the right time,” Gite said. Meanwhile, the head of plastic surgery Dr Nitin Ghag started operating on her left hand. “Her hand was hanging, the nerve, tendons and muscles were damaged. I had to use blood vessels from the thigh and reattach her hand,” he said. The surgery stretched for six hours, until 7 pm. Sister-in-law Anuradha Katkar said before surgery the doctors had warned that an infection from the hand could affect the brain if the hand was not amputated on time. “We thought she had lost her hand. She washes utensils to earn a living.”
By evening, the orthopaedics team realigned the bone in the hand and blood had started flowing again. “We need time to assess whether nerve sensations will return,” Ghag added. By dusk, Katkar’s brain injury had started swelling following multiple surgeries. “We noticed her clinical status had deteriorated,” neurosurgeon Maheshwari said. Maheshwari has been working with BMC hospitals for six years. She took a bold decision, to conduct a craniotomy.
Associate professor of anaesthesia Dr Harpreet Kaur said the challenge was to keep Katkar stabilised on the ventilator to maintain blood pressure. “The blood loss was huge. It was important to balance her vitals amidst all surgeries.” Kaur, with an experience of nine years, previously worked with Nair hospital. “In government hospitals, we are always prepared for emergencies,” she said.
By 9.30 pm, decompression surgery on the brain began. “We removed a portion of skull bone. The skull had restricted the swelling due to the injury,” Maheshwari said. During the surgery that lasted till 3 am, Katkar’s parameters worsened. “… But we managed to stabilise her,” Maheshwari says. The next 48 hours remain critical for Katkar as she remains on ventilator support. If her hand starts turning black, it may indicate need for amputation. On Wednesday, an anti-gangrene injection was administered. If she survives for next 48 hours, doctors hope for a normal recovery.
“There will be deficits, but we are trying to bring her as close to her previous self as possible,” said plastic surgeon Ghag.
Husband Luv Katkar, a housekeeping worker in Vile Parle, has not left her side since Tuesday. “She moved her legs a little bit today,” he says. Their son Siddhesh refuses to return home without his mother. In their Juhu chawl, he runs from one house to another to play with neighbours. “We have told him she is in the dawakhana (hospital), but he keeps asking if she is alive,” Sarojini, Katkar’s mother-in-law said.

A western Illinois sheriff says the branch that fell on spectators during a fireworks display, killing two, measured more than 8-feet (2.5 meters) around at its base and was about 45 feet (14 meters) long.
Rock Island County Sheriff Gerald Bustos said Wednesday the branch fell from an oak tree that's believed to be about 100 years old. It fell about 25 feet (8 meters) during a Tuesday night event outside the courthouse in Rock Island.
Bustos said autopsies will be conducted later Wednesday on 61-year-old Daniel Mendoza Sr. of Rock Island and 72-year-old Lawrence Anderson of Moline.
Six other people were treated for injuries, including a 21-year-old pregnant woman from East Moline who was near term. Bustos said the woman was taken to a local hospital where she gave birth. He says mother and baby are in good health.

Dhule Collector Rahul Rekhawar has described the lynching of five people by a mob in the district on Sunday as a “spontaneous act” in his report to the Maharashtra government, it is learnt.
The report, submitted on Tuesday, states that the exact sequence of events that led to the attack – over suspicion that they were child-lifters – is still being probed by police, officials said.

“The murders were not planned but a spontaneous act in which the mob killed the five victim,” an official privy to details said, quoting the report.
“While the report does mention social media messages and rumours reaching the hamlet. But (it states that) whether there is a connection between a WhatsApp post/posts and the incident…needs to be probe in detail by the police,” the official said.

He said the district administration has written to Maharashtra Police’s cyber cell to probe the origin of the fake social media posts. “Once we manage to trace the person who posted the fake posts, action will be taken against him,” Rekhawar said.
The lynching took place in Dhule’s Rainpada hamlet, around 350 km from Mumbai. All five victims belonged to Dawari Gosavi community, a nomadic tribe as per the state list.
An officer who is part of the investigation said some of the accused, who have been arrested, have justified their act claiming that they were teaching a lesson to the “gang” that, they alleged, had come to Rainpada to abduct their children and sell off their body parts. “Asked about documents the victims tried to show to ascertain that they came from a tribe of nomads who travel village to village, begging for a living, the accused said they found it bogus,” the officer said.

“During interrogation they told us that they received several videos of (alleged) child-lifters in way of WhatsApp forwards over the last couple of months, and that they (these rumours) were being discussed (in the area). We have found many such videos on their phones and are probing if the two (the video clips and the fatal assault) are connected,” a senior Dhule police officer told The Indian Express.
Dhule Superintendent of Police M Ramkumar said, “Our focus is to arrest those who assaulted the victims, and not the bystanders. We have found 40 mobile phone clips shots by witnesses and we are studying them to zero in on the accused.”

The president of the Supreme Court, Malgorzata Gersdorf, defied the new law on Wednesday morning by going to her office as usual, to applause from hundreds of supporters who chanted ""constitution"" and sang the Polish national anthem.
""My presence here is not about politics, I am here to protect the rule of law,"" she told reporters.
Gersdorf is 65, the age at which judges are now required to retire, but a constitutional law expert said she met the conditions to remain in place until her six-year term has expired. Gersdorf became Supreme Court president in 2014.
""The law cannot work retroactively. So this legislation... is clearly unconstitutional... and could lead to paralysis at the Supreme Court,"" said the expert, Marek Chmaj.

Addressing the European Parliament on Wednesday in Strasbourg, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki defended his government's overhaul of the judiciary.
""Each EU state has the right to shape their legal system according to their own traditions,"" he said, adding that the EU should focus on external challenges and not wage a ""campaign"" against the democratically elected government of a member state.
PROTESTS
EU lawmakers gave Morawiecki a rough reception. Maltese lawmaker Roberta Metsola said the judicial reforms were about ""consolidating (government) control by weakening the institutions designed to keep you in check"".
After staging protests on Tuesday outside the Supreme Court, Polish pro-democracy activists have vowed to hold more rallies around the country on Wednesday.
But the protest turned out smaller than a crowd of 4,000 people a day earlier, disappointing Lech Walesa, a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former president credited with bringing down Polish communism in 1989, who came from Gdansk to Warsaw to express his objection to the court changes.
""With such an amount we will not win much,"" Walesa said in front of the protesters outside the Supreme Court building in the centre of Warsaw. ""It is getting serious when they ruin our courts. Really, sooner or later this may lead to a civil war.""
Through legislation and personnel changes, PiS has already taken de facto control of much of the judicial system since taking power in 2015, including the constitutional court and prosecutors, who now report directly to the justice minister.
""We are moving towards a dictatorship,"" said Joanna Tworog, a 65-year-old webmaster in the crowd supporting Gersdorf earlier on Wednesday.
""What if I have a court case against someone from PiS and they can influence judges? These changes affect me personally.""
Critics at home and abroad say the ruling party's policies, which also include tighter control of public media, amount to a shift towards authoritarian rule.
The conflict has isolated Poland in Europe, where most governments are critical, while also exposing the EU's inability to rein in governments it believes contradict core EU values.
The European Commission opened a fresh legal case against Poland over the Supreme Court changes on Monday, saying they undermine judicial independence in the largest ex-communist EU member state.
Warsaw faces the theoretical threat of losing its voting rights in the EU under a procedure launched late last year in response to the reforms. But Hungary, also facing criticism over democratic standards, has pledged to block such a move.
The PiS government says EU treaties do not give Brussels institutions the power to influence national matters such as the judiciary.
""The court system ... is an entirely internal matter,"" PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski was quoted as saying by Gazeta Polska newsweekly in an article published on Wednesday.
The party's standing in polls has held steady at around 40 percent throughout the dispute, well above any other rival.

It had said that the final approval from Sebi for the mutual fund is awaited.
Private sector lender Yes Bank on Wednesday said it has received approval from capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to start a mutual fund business.
This approval is subsequent to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) approval granted to Yes Bank to sponsor a mutual fund followed by Sebi’s in-principle approval received subsequently, the bank said in a statement.
“Yes Asset Management (India) Limited (YAMIL) will leverage Yes Bank’s Knowledge Banking expertise and relationship capital across retail, corporate and institutional investors to effectively channelise their assets in equity and debt capital markets,” the bank’s managing director and chief executive officer Rana Kapoor said.
This strategic initiative will further complement Yes Bank’s retail liabilities and wealth management strategy, and also allow YAMIL to build on the bank’s distribution network to provide customers a seamless investment and banking experience, Kapoor said.
The lender said it has recruited a team to establish the operations under the guidance of the Board of Directors and trustees. Yes Asset Management will launch fund offerings across the spectrum of both debt and equity markets over the next 6-12 months.

"LONDON: Iran could reduce its co-operation with the UN nuclear watchdog, President Hassan Rouhani told the body's head on Wednesday (Jul 4), after he warned US President Donald Trump of ""consequences"" of fresh sanctions against Iranian oil sales.
In May, Trump pulled out of a multinational deal under which sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs to its nuclear programme, verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Washington has since told countries they must stop buying Iranian oil from Nov 4 or face financial measures.

""Iran’s nuclear activities have always been for peaceful purposes, but it is Iran that would decide on its level of cooperation with the IAEA,"" Iranian state news agency IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying after meeting IAEA head ​​​​​​​Yukiya Amano in Vienna.
""The responsibility for the change of Iran's cooperation level with the IAEA falls on those who have created this new situation,” he added.
Rouhani said earlier in the day Tehran would stand firm against U.S. threats to cut Iranian oil sales.
""The Americans say they want to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero ... It shows they have not thought about its consequences,"" Rouhani was quoted as saying by IRNA.

On Tuesday, Rouhani hinted at a threat to disrupt oil shipments from neighbouring countries if Washington tries to cut its exports.
He did not elaborate, but an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander explicitly said on Wednesday Iran would block any exports of crude for the Gulf in retaliation for hostile US action.
""If they want to stop Iranian oil exports, we will not allow any oil shipment to pass through the Strait of Hormuz,” Ismail Kowsari was quoted as saying by the Young Journalists Club (YJC) website.
Major-General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds force, in charge of foreign operations for the Revolutionary Guards, said in a letter published on IRNA: ""I kiss your (Rouhani's) hand for expressing such wise and timely comments, and I am at your service to implement any policy that serves the Islamic Republic.""
""SELF HARM""
Rouhani, in Vienna trying to salvage the nuclear deal, said U.S. sanctions were a ""crime and aggression"", and called on European and other governments to stand up to Trump.
""Iran will survive this round of U.S. sanctions as it has survived them before. This U.S. government will not stay in office forever ... But history will judge other nations based on what they do today,"" he said.
Rouhani told reporters that if the remaining signatories - the Europeans Britain, France and Germany as well as China and Russia - can guarantee Iran's benefits: ""Iran will remain in the nuclear deal without the United States.""
Iran’s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said on the Iranian oil ministry news agency SHANA:
""Trump’s demand that Iranian oil should not be bought, and (his) pressures on European firms at a time when Nigeria and Libya are in crisis, when Venezuela's oil exports have fallen due to U.S. sanctions, when Saudi’s domestic consumption has increased in summer, is nothing but self harm.
""It will increase the prices of oil in the global markets,"" he said. ""At the end it is the American consumer who will pay the price for Mr. Trump’s policy.""
The European Union, once Iran's biggest oil importer, has vowed to keep the 2015 deal alive without the United States by trying to keep Iran's oil and investment flowing. But European officials acknowledge that U.S. sanctions make it difficult to give Tehran guarantees.
Foreign ministers from the five remaining signatories will meet Iranian officials in Vienna on Friday to discuss how to keep the accord alive.",www.channelnewsasia.com,2018-07-05 02:35:42,23,205965

Punjab National Bank (PNB) has put on sale loans worth Rs 300 crore to three entities and sought bids from asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) on a cash basis or through a mix of cash and security receipts (SRs), according to a sale document. Bidding will be held on the bank’s e-auction platform.
The accounts are SVS Buildcon (`50 crore), Gwalior Jhansi Expressways (Rs 105 crore) and Shiva Texfabs (Rs 145 crore). The first two accounts — both Delhi-based —will be sold on a cash basis. The exposure to the Ludhiana-based Shiva Texfabs account will allow for a mix of SRs and cash in a ratio of 24:76.

According to WhatsApp, almost 25 per cent of its users in India were not in groups, the majority of groups in India have less than 10 people and nine in 10 messages are still sent from just one person to another.
A day after the Centre wrote to WhatsApp seeking action against unverified information circulating on its platform, the company on Wednesday said it was working proactively to prevent misuse of its messaging platform and detailed its approach to tackle the “challenge”.
Responding to a letter from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY), WhatsApp announced that it would “soon” launch a new feature which will highlight forwarded messages.
The company also listed non-technological solutions that include collaborating with academics, police and fact-checking organisations, public safety ad campaigns, educational material on misinformation and other measures to meet the challenge.

“We have been testing a new label in India that highlights when a message has been forwarded versus composed by the sender. This could serve as an important signal for recipients to think twice before forwarding messages because it lets a user know if content they received was written by the person they know or a potential rumour from someone else,” WhatsApp told the government adding that they planned to “launch this new feature soon”.

Additionally, the company said it was “working to improve” its capability to “stop unwanted automated messages” and spam through its platform. “We do have the ability to prevent spam, which includes some of the misinformation that can create mistrust and potentially violence. Because we cannot see the content of messages being sent over WhatsApp we block messages based on user reports and by the manner in which they are sent,” the company told the Centre.
“We use machine learning to identify accounts sending a high volume of messages and we are constantly working to improve our ability to stop unwanted automated messages.”

Over the past year, at least two dozen people have been killed in mob violence linked to hate crimes and rumours on child-lifting — which circulated on social media — that have increased over the past few weeks.
“We believe that false news, misinformation and the spread of hoaxes are issues best tackled collectively: by government, civil society and technology companies working together,” WhatsApp said in its reply to the Centre.
IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday urged the company to realise its announcements soon. “While we welcome (Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp) completely, they are also making a commercial success of us. (They) must remain accountable, responsible, and vigilant,” he said.
According to WhatsApp, almost 25 per cent of its users in India were not in groups, the majority of groups in India have less than 10 people and nine in 10 messages are still sent from just one person to another.
WhatsApp has also said that messages on its platform are encrypted but the company does have access to metadata, which is information about the messages including contact lists and mobile phone numbers.
The company said that it blocks spam based on user reports and examines this metadata.
At the MEITY press conference on Wednesday, Prasad said that the circulation of rumours “designed to provoke and instigate … can be handled by the application of technology.” Prasad said that WhatsApp must work closely with his ministry, the Home Ministry, and the state police apparatus.

The SHO of Hauz Khas police station ordered the head constable to shift the rest of the animals, as well as the carcass, to the Society For Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Tis Hazari.
Instead, the head constable took them to a slaughterhouse in Ghazipur, where he allegedly sold five buffaloes and exchanged the carcass for a calf.

"The United States appears to have shelved an ""all or nothing"" approach to North Korean denuclearisation as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prepares to head back to North Korea this week hoping to agree a roadmap for its nuclear disarmament.
WASHINGTON: The United States appears to have shelved an ""all or nothing"" approach to North Korean denuclearisation as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prepares to head back to North Korea this week hoping to agree a roadmap for its nuclear disarmament.
Pompeo will spend a day and a half in North Korea on Friday and Saturday on what will be his third trip to the country this year, and his first since an unprecedented summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on Jun 12.
Advertisement
It will be Pompeo's first overnight stop in the country, with which the United States had remained technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice not a peace treaty.
At the Singapore summit, Kim made a broad commitment to ""work towards denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,"" but has made no mention of how or when Pyongyang might give up a nuclear weapons programme that threatens the United States and its allies.
US officials have since been trying to flesh out an agreement critics say is short on substance and map a route to a deal that might live up to Trump's enthusiastic portrayal of the summit outcome.
But US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there had been no sign of a breakthrough and little progress towards even defining the keys terms of any agreement.

What has been seen instead is an apparent softening in the Trump administration's approach, in spite of what US officials say are intelligence assessments saying that North Korea is continuing to deceive Washington about its weapons programmes.
The US administration has previously demanded that North Korea agree to abandon its entire nuclear programme before it could expect any relief from tough international sanctions. Ahead of the Singapore summit, Pompeo said Trump would reject anything short of ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation.""
But following talks on Sunday between US envoy Sung Kim and North Korean counterparts to set up Pompeo's latest Pyongyang visit, this ""CVID"" mantra appears suddenly to have disappeared from the State Department lexicon.
It says pressure will remain until North Korea denuclearises, but in statements this week, has redefined the US goal as ""the final, fully verified denuclearisation of (North Korea) as agreed to by Chairman Kim.""
STEP BACK
Two US officials said the Trump administration had stepped back from its CVID demand on South Korea's advice.
The South Koreans, who have been pursuing their own talks with North Korea, argued that step-by-step negotiations were more likely to be successful than insisting Pyongyang yield to all US demands before any concessions.
There was also a realisation, one official said, that maintaining Chinese and Russian cooperation over North Korea would be “more problematic if the US stuck to an all-or-nothing posture.”
The official said that the North Koreans had largely refused in talks with Sung Kim to respond to attempts to define the key terms of an eventual agreement, including the words complete, verifiable and irreversible.
“The choice was either bend it or break it,” one of the officials said.
A senior South Korean official told US officials in a meeting in Washington last month that the US side should stop pressing for CVID, which North Korea saw as a recipe for unilateral disarmament that would leave it vulnerable to regime change, according to a source familiar with the discussions.
The South Korean official suggested that the US instead refer to ""mutual threat reduction,"" the source said.
The official also argued that it would be difficult to inspect North Korean nuclear and missile facilities in a conventional way involving ""hundreds"" of international investigators, as Pyongyang would be unlikely to accept.
Patrick Cronin of the Centre for a New American Security, an Asia expert in close touch with US and South Korean officials, said the thinking seemed to be that although Kim would not want to give up his entire nuclear programme anytime soon, he might be willing to dismantle major portions of it.
""The US may be exploring the degree to which he will dismantle major programmes within the coming months, and if dropping some language to do this is required, Washington seems willing to do that at this point,"" he said.
""Because verified denuclearisation of the main elements of a nuclear and missile programme is the best that can be hoped for, Washington has quietly begun emphasising final, fully verified denuclearisation,” he said.
""Ambiguity in language may open up space for agreement despite the fact that interlocutors have different goals in mind. This is what is occurring right now as Washington and Pyongyang engage in talks to determine whether a workable deal is possible.""
White House national security adviser John Bolton said on Sunday the bulk of North Korea's weapons programs could be dismantled within a year - ""if they have the strategic decision already made to do that.""
On Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert declined give a time frame for North Korea's denuclearisation.
""I know some individuals have given timelines; we're not going to provide a timeline for that,"" she said. ""A lot of work is left to be done, certainly. We go into this eyes wide open.""",www.channelnewsasia.com,2018-07-05 02:30:29,29,204167
"Muthoot Finance is the largest gold financing company in India in terms of loan portfolio.
Kerala-based gold loan major Muthoot Finance (MFL) on Wednesday announced that it is expanding its lending portfolio by venturing into personal loans.
The company will focus on delivering faster and efficient service to customers with simple documentation and appraisal process. Any salaried individual with stable employment and a monthly salary of `20,000 or more in metro locations and Rs 10,000 or more in other towns can apply for a personal loan with MFL. The rate of interest starts from 14% onwards.
Speaking at a press conference here, George M Alexander, executive director, Muthoot Finance, said: “The disbursement of personal loan has witnessed consistent growth in India for the last 15 years. Also, the advent of credit bureaus has made personal loans more accessible to salaried class as financial institutions are willing to lend more based on individuals’ past credit behaviour.”
According to him, the company will be able to leverage the existing customer base through its branches and direct sales team, thereby reaching to more and more customers. At a time when most of the lenders focus on financing individuals employed with large and established corporates, state and central government employees, Muthoot Finance will focus equally on salaried individuals employed with SMEs as well as with bigger corporates. “We will also lend personal loans to first time borrowers who meet our underwriting norms,” he said.
In FY19, the company aims to offer the personal loan product in more than 20 cities of south India. The company aims to build a portfolio of Rs 3,000 crore by 2023.

THREE OF the seven persons linked to the Indian Mujahideen terror outfit, who are under trial for carrying out a series of blasts at the Chinnaswamy stadium in Bengaluru on April 17, 2010 ahead of an IPL cricket match, on Wednesday filed applications before a trial court pleading guilty to their offences — setting the stage for their conviction in the case.
Gauhar Aziz Khomeni, Kamal Hassan and Mohammed Kafeel Akhtar, all from Darbhanga in Bihar, were arrested in November 2011 from different parts of northern India by the Delhi Special Cell in the course of investigations into terror activities of the IM.
The three persons are accused of being part of a conspiracy in which they helped IM leader Yasin Bhatkal prepare five bombs at a hideout in Tumkur town, around 60 km from Bengaluru. The bombs were planted around the stadium on the intervening night of April 16 and April 17 by Yasin and an aide, Qateel Siddiqui, who was killed in a Pune jail brawl in 2012.
Two of the five bombs planted by the group exploded on April 17 ahead of an IPL match, injuring five people. The other three bombs were found by the police after they failed to explode.
On Wednesday, Khomeni, Hassan and Akhtar filed applications pleading guilty under Section 229 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 after a sessions court conducting the trial rejected a plea bargain application filed by them on Tuesday. The trial court will decide on the applications on July 9. The three men, who have already spent six years in prison, had said in the bargain plea that they were not directly involved with the act of planting the bombs.

"“We cannot leave Delhi to die like this,” said a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar. (Express photo/Praveen Khanna) “We cannot leave Delhi to die like this,” said a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar. (Express photo/Praveen Khanna)
If Delhi feels that development projects need to be dismantled, they will be dismantled, the Delhi High Court Wednesday told the authorities undertaking the proposed redevelopment of seven central government housing projects in south Delhi.
“We cannot leave Delhi to die like this,” said a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar, adding that the government and authorities concerned shall refrain from felling a “single tree” in the capital till further orders.
On the plea by senior orthopaedic surgeon Dr Kaushal Kant Mishra, who challenged the environment clearance given to the housing projects, the bench prohibited authorities from cutting trees till the next date of hearing, July 26. It also asked the Delhi government to “explain how a fully grown tree could be equated to 10 saplings” and “how long a sapling will take to grow into a tree”.
Observing that the residential projects spanning six colonies — Sarojini Nagar, Nauroji Nagar, Netaji Nagar, Thyagraj Nagar, Mohammadpur and Kasturba Nagar — would create traffic chaos near AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital, the court warned that it would give orders regarding demolition of the East Kidwai Nagar project, if required, as it seems to be haphazard and impacts the hospitals.
The court also asked authorities to explain how they planned to tackle waste management, vehicle parking and other aspects while undertaking the project. Noting that Delhi is home to a large population of avian fauna and trees, the bench also sought to know if the Kidwai Nagar project will impact the environment. Pointing out that since 1987, all courts have been insisting on the “mantra of decongesting Delhi”, the court asked why such projects cannot be shifted to outer Delhi, and that authorities should develop colonies like Narela.
Taking note of a submission that Delhi was running out of groundwater, the court asked the Centre and the city government how they propose to water saplings that are going to replace fully grown trees under the compensatory afforestation policy.
The counsel for the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) Limited, tasked with redeveloping half-a-dozen south Delhi colonies, claimed that no garbage was going out of the construction site. The bench, however, asked the ministries of environment and forest and housing, the Delhi government, NBCC, Delhi Development Authority, Delhi Jal Board, New Delhi Municipal Council and other authorities to file a detailed reply and explain why it was necessary to cut trees and how they changed the Master plan on the matter retrospectively.
The court also appointed two amicus curiae in the housing project matter, including environmentalist M C Mehta.
Meanwhile, the Delhi government’s standing counsel told the court that the government has started the process of revoking and reviewing permission granted to cut trees for the projects.
The court also sought response of authorities on a contempt plea filed by environmentalist Vimlendu Jha, alleging that there was deliberate and willful default of the NBCC’s June 25 undertaking given to the court not to cut trees till July 4 for the housing projects.

Millman was preparing to face Milos Raonic ahead of his 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-4) second-round defeat, when officials informed the colourful Australian's underwear was too bright for his shorts.
It required his father Ron, known universally as ""The Fox"", to make a mad dash to a local shop to find smalls more suitable for the tastes of the All England Club.
The affable Queenslander revealed earlier this week his father was on strike one after he left him waiting for two hours after an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate London's public transport system from Heathrow airport.
However, after coming to his rescue, he said The Fox's punishment has been downgraded to half-a-strike.
""I don't know where he got them from, but he walks everywhere. He walks here every day from Clapham,"" Millman said.
""The Lotto pants this year are really thin, which is good for us, it feels like you are playing naked out there.
""I shouldn't say this, but I have worn those undies, or similar types, for the last few years.
""But this year they came down hard, as they do. But The Fox delivered. Good man, he has rubbed half a stroke off.""
Millman held up well to a serving barrage from Raonic, who leads the championships with 52 aces.
One thunderbolt from the 2016 finalist eclipsed the 236kph mark - just shy of the record 238kph hurled down by giant American Taylor Dent in 2010.
Raonic crunched 32 aces, in a match dominated by serve with Millman very much holding his own with both players being broken just once.
""I thought I served pretty well, missed one or two in the tiebreak and that was the difference,"" he said.
""I thought he returned well. He picked up one or two from his toes.
""But that is tennis. I knew it was going to be a tough game and I did everything I could out there.""
Millman is set to leave London with a new career-high ranking of 51 when the new standings are released next week, but left thinking of what could have been with a kinder draw.
""The way I have been hitting the ball ... I honestly felt I could beat a good few guys that are left in the draw,"" the 29-year-old said.
""That's not me being cocky or confident. I just thought there was a lot of guys that I could beat. I just come up against a pretty tough test in the big Canadian.""",www.news.com.au,2018-07-05 02:23:01,26,421210
"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The mother of a girl at the center of a medical and religious debate over brain death says she doesn't regret moving from California to New Jersey so her daughter could receive care after being declared dead.
Nailah Winkfield told reporters Tuesday that she gave up everything for daughter Jahi McMath, but it was worthwhile. The San Francisco Chronicle reports that Jahi will be buried Friday in Hayward, California.
Winkfield says doctors declared Jahi dead on June 22 after an operation to treat an intestinal issue.
McMath had already been declared dead in December 2013 after suffering irreversible brain damage during routine surgery in California when she was 13.
Winkfield refused to accept the conclusion and took McMath to New Jersey, which accommodates religions that don't recognize brain death.",www.taiwannews.com.tw,2018-07-05 02:22:00,6,3288

With sultry tuxedos and a gown that appeared to waft down the catwalk like cigarette smoke, French designer Jean Paul Gaultier celebrated smoking in all its forms on Wednesday in a fashion show filled with tongue-in-cheek digs at overly rigid attitudes.
PARIS: With sultry tuxedos and a gown that appeared to waft down the catwalk like cigarette smoke, French designer Jean Paul Gaultier celebrated smoking in all its forms on Wednesday in a fashion show filled with tongue-in-cheek digs at overly rigid attitudes.
Reinterpretations of ""Le Smoking"" - or tuxedos for women popularized by late French couturier Yves Saint Laurent in the 1960s - dominated the Haute Couture collection, with black and white combinations of jackets and ruffled dresses for instance.

The designer took smoke as his inspiration for a see-through dress decked out in swirling embellishments, or a wedding gown with a featherlight, waspy train that looked like it could vanish into thin air as it twirled on the runway.
Gaultier, the self-style ""enfant terrible"" of the fashion world, was also deliberately harking back to a period when smoking was more widely acceptable.
""I don't smoke, but I was always surrounded by people that were smoking,"" Gaultier said after the show in Paris.
""I don't say 'don't smoke or smoke', it's only that people should do what they want.""

Smoking was banned in public places in France in 2006, echoing clampdowns in many other countries by authorities for health reasons.
The collection also featured a pair of male and female models walking in step and showcasing their breasts behind transparent panels with the slogan ""Free the nipple"".
Gaultier said that felt that society had taken some steps backwards following the ""free-all"" protest movements of feminists in the 1960s and 1970s.
""Now there is again a kind of puritanism that arrived. Me, I am for the bra, but ... to oblige people to wear a bra, no, I'm not for that at all,"" added the designer, famous for creating a stage costume for singer Madonna featuring a conical bra.
Gaultier's couture brand is owned by private Spanish fashion and fragrance group Puig.
Paris Haute Couture Week - where a select club of fashion houses present their one-of-a-kind creations and showcase some of their most elaborate styles - runs until July 5. On Thursday top jewelry brands are presenting their collections.

"PARIS: France and Germany will send two men, including an Iranian diplomat, to Belgium to face accusations they were involved in a plot to bomb an Iranian opposition rally on the outskirts of Paris, judicial sources said on Wednesday.
Belgium is already investigating two Belgians of Iranian origin arrested on Saturday, the day of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) meeting. Five hundred grams of the homemade explosive TATP and a detonation device were found in their car.

Iran has said it had nothing to do with the plot, which it called a ""false flag"" operation staged by figures within the opposition group itself.
The exiled Iranian opposition group's meeting was attended by Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who gave a speech calling for the removal of Iran's rulers.
In addition to the two people arrested in Belgium, an Austria-based Iranian diplomat was held in Germany, and a man of Iranian origin was held in France. Judicial authorities in France and Germany told Reuters Belgium had requested they be extradited.
""It's extremely sensitive and the Belgians are taking the lead,"" said one European intelligence source.

During a visit by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to Vienna on Wednesday, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a statement to reporters that Rouhani had assured him that he would work to clarify the case.
French officials have declined to comment on the matter saying the nature of the incident is unclear.
Highlighting the political sensitivities, Iran summoned France's ambassador to protest against the staging of the opposition meeting. Tehran ""strongly protested against the French support of activities of the terrorist organisation,"" referring to an exiled opposition group.
France's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Since the United States withdrew in May from a deal to lift sanctions on Iran in return for curbs to Tehran's nuclear programme, the deal's European signatories Britain, France and Germany have said they want to save the accord. Iran has called on the European countries to offer economic benefits to make up for the damage caused by new U.S. sanctions.
Any suggestion that Iranian authorities were behind the plot in France could make it politically difficult for leaders, especially French President Emmanuel Macron, to continue to back the nuclear deal.
The Austrian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday it was stripping the diplomatic status of the diplomat arrested in Germany. Iran's foreign ministry has rejected as baseless the allegations against the diplomat.

THE Mumbai Police on Saturday suspended a constable for allegedly demanding money from autorickshaw drivers in Goregaon while being under the influence of alcohol.
Subhash Pawar, posted with Goregaon police station, also allegedly tried to strip inside the police station after his superiors threatened to initiate action against him.
The suspension order was issued on Saturday after a report in the matter was submitted to the commisioner’s office.
On June 24, Pawar who was in uniform and in-charge of police mobile van number 1, was seen demanding money from autorickshaw drivers outside Goregaon railway station. A source said: “Pawar was under the influence of alcohol, which was noticed by a beat marshall constable. Somehow, the beat marshal managed to convince Pawar and made him sit inside the nearest beat chowkey. Initially, two officers were sent to check on Pawar. But as he misbehaved, he was brought to the police station where senior officers tried to reason with him. Pawar reportedly tried taking his clothes off when he was threatened with action.”
The source added: “He removed his belt and when he was about to remove his clothes, he was stopped by officers and then taken to Siddharth Hospital for a medical examination.” A case under Section 85 (1) of the Bombay Prohibition Act was registered at Goregaon police station against the constable.
Terming it substance-induced psychosis, Dr Kaminidevi Bhoir, a psychiatric counsellor from the police hospital, said: “Consuming too much substance for a long period of time becomes an addiction. So, after sometime, one loses touch with the reality due to which, one’s behaviour changes and the person has no control.”

"Kris Gopalakrishnan also said society too had to take initiatives to check such incidents
Artificial intelligence could be used to check circulation of false information and fake videos about ""child-lifters"" on social media that lead to incidents of violence including lynching, software major Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan said.
It was humanly not possible for anyone to screen each and every post when about two billion people were using Facebook alone, he told reporters yesterday.
He was replying to a question on how to contain incidents of violence including lynching of over a dozen people in different parts of the country in recent days.
Taking a serious view of the incidents, the government is planning to take the help of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp to check the circulation of false information and fake videos.
Mr Gopalakrishnan also said society too had to take initiatives to check such incidents.
""It is a combination - On one side, we have to educate the consumers and on the other, the technology companies also will have to put in some filters, screens and things like that... We need to teach in schools, colleges,"" he said.
Mr Gopalakrishnan emphasised that people must verify the source of the information before sharing it.
""Everybody has a role to play. Media hasa very big role...You need to also tell them that don't believein everything you get from social media,"" he said.
He also said such lynching incidents happen due to lack of implementation of laws and ""differential"" implementation of laws.",www.ndtv.com,2018-07-05 02:19:28,10,643026
"The MSP for groundnut has been hiked to Rs 4,890 per quintal. The MSP for groundnut has been hiked to Rs 4,890 per quintal.
Nathubhai Kadivar is happy about the Narendra Modi government jacking up the minimum support price (MSP) for groundnut to Rs 4,890 per quintal this kharif season, from Rs 4,450 in 2017-18. “I have just sown the crop in 10 hectares and cotton in another 10 (the MSP of long-staple kapas has also been hiked from Rs 4,320 to Rs 5,450 per quintal). The price announced is very good,” says this farmer from Nasitpar village in Tankara taluka of Morbi district.
However, he also recounts last year’s bitter experience of not being able to sell his 140 quintals from five hectares at the MSP of Rs 4,500 per quintal, inclusive of the Gujarat government’s Rs 50 bonus. “Not only was my yield below the normal 36-37 quintals per hectare, but I had to sell at an average of Rs 3,625. By the time my turn came, the government had stopped procuring,” complains Kadivar.
The 50-year-old is a relatively better-off farmer, with his 20-hectare holding (half of it taken on lease) having assured irrigation from the Demi-II dam. “Groundnut yields are less than cotton (about 40 quintals/hectare) and so are realisations. But it has a shorter duration (100-120 days), allowing me to take a rabi (winter) crop. That is not possible in cotton, which grows for 200-240 days,” he explains.
Groundnut and cotton are the most important crops in Gujarat’s Saurashtra region. The ruling BJP, which suffered huge reverses in Morbi and 10 other districts of this belt at December’s State Assembly elections, has reasons to grant handsome MSP increases for both. But neither farmers like Kadivar nor those in the trade are convinced about their effectiveness, when open market prices are ruling way lower.
“Last year, the MSP was Rs 4,500, but I got the best-quality groundnut from the market at Rs 3,500. It was a bumper crop and the government could not have procured every pod produced,” notes Dhansukh Nandania, proprietor of Ravi Oil Mill at Gondal, about 40 km from Rajkot.
What is heavily weighing down sentiment now is the huge unsold stock of groundnut with National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed), the apex agency that procured 10 lakh tonnes (lt) during 2017-18. 8.08 lt of it was just from Gujarat, which produced around 32 lt of the oilseed.
“About 7.4 lt of stocks, including 40,000 tonnes procured in 2016-17, is still lying in godowns at Gujarat,” admits V R Boda, chairman of Nafed, which is currently disposing of its groundnuts at just over Rs 3,300 per quintal.
For the Modi government, the real challenge ahead is in ensuring that farmers get the MSPs just announced. And it would be more in crops other than wheat and paddy.

"Deepak Parekh, chairman, HDFC
Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) is seeking opportunities in stressed real estate assets, chairman Deepak Parekh said in his letter to shareholders.
According to Parekh, while some of the plans for the future are still on the drawing board stage, yet, these are the broad contours. “We want to focus on strengthening our presence across the entire value chain of housing, seek opportunities in stressed real estate assets, mark a deeper footprint in the health insurance space and explore emerging organic and inorganic growth opportunities,” he said, adding that HDFC will also continue to support the growth of its subsidiary companies.
Parekh said that one aspect that the housing sector has always grappled with is how can land be made available at reasonable prices. The answer, he added, lies in smart regulation. Parekh explained that for the past twelve years, the regulators have not allowed banks and housing finance companies (HFCs) to fund land transactions, yet non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and private equity players are permitted to do so.
“This regulatory arbitrage allows NBFCs and private equity players to levy prohibitively high interest rates on developers borrowing to acquire land,” he said.
Parekh questioned the rationale behind allowing NBFCs to cross over into activities of HFCs, then why can’t HFCs be permitted to fund developers to buy land for affordable housing? “One can understand the central bank’s predicament of not wanting banks at this juncture to fund land transactions. But the core role of the HFCs is to support housing,” he explained, adding that if HFCs of a certain threshold size are permitted to fund developers to acquire land for affordable housing, then the current high interest rates are likely to get rationalised.
He said that HDFC regularly engages in dialogue with stakeholders on developments of the corporation, but desist from the practice of quarterly or annual earnings guidance.
‘Succession a key agenda’
Parekh also said succession planning at the housing finance firm and its group companies is a “key agenda” before their boards and they need to evaluate options of both external and internal candidates.
Parekh, however, made it clear that at HDFC Ltd, the board and its present vice chairman and CEO Keki Mistry have agreed that he will continue in this role for a period of three years, subject to shareholders’ nod.
Parekh said he is confident of the strong pipeline of talent for various functions across all companies within the HDFC Group.",www.financialexpress.com,2018-07-05 02:19:01,14,245706

With over 20 days remaining before the Punjab and Haryana High Court hears the CBI’s petition, requesting transfer of the murder case of a seven-year-old boy at a prominent Gurgaon school to the CBI court in Panchkula, a Gurgaon court Wednesday adjourned the scheduled hearing on the matter. It set a date of July 30 for the next hearing — four days after the High Court proceedings.
“The child sessions court that was hearing the matter passed a reference order, through which the case was heard today in the court of the district and sessions judge. The court said that since the matter is already pending in the High Court, no decision can be made here. A date of July 30 has been set when the hearing will proceed on the basis of the High Court’s proceedings on July 26,” said Sushil Tekriwal, counsel for the victim’s father.
“These requests and complexities are delaying the trial… Even the court took note of this fact today, saying that in such a serious matter, the trial should have been completed by now,” he added. The incident took place in September last year, when the Class II student was found with his throat slit in a ground floor bathroom of the school. While a bus conductor was initially arrested for the crime, the CBI, which eventually took over the case from Gurgaon Police, arrested a Class XI student of the same school. It claimed that the juvenile had murdered the boy in the hope of getting the examinations and a parent-teacher meeting cancelled.
The school’s regional and human resources (HR) heads, who were implicated for security lapses on the school’s part, were also asked to be in court on Wednesday. “They have been asked to be present on July 30. The CBI was also asked to file the chargesheet by Wednesday, but they said their probe is still ongoing and need more time. The court has given them till July 30 to file the final chargesheet,” said Tekriwal.

"Dena Bank (Reuters)
Mid-sized public-sector lender Dena Bank has sought bids for its stakes in NSDL e-Governance Infrastructure, National Securities Depository (NSDL) and Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) to raise Rs 235 crore, according to a public notice.
“The bank is proposing to sell (i) 6,25,000 equity shares of face value Rs 10 each of NSDL e-Governance Infrastructure, which is 1.563% of the total paid-up equity capital with a floor price of `910 per share, (ii) 2,25,000 equity shares of NSDL which is 0.563% of the total paid-up equity capital at floor price of `860 per share, (iii) 4,00,000 equity shares of NSDL which is 1.00% of the total paid-up equity capital at floor price of Rs 860 per share, (iv) 48,00,000 equity shares of Sidbi which is 0.90% of the total paid-up equity capital with a floor price of `260 per share,” Dena Bank said in the notice on Wednesday.
The last date for the submission of bids is July 25. Dena Bank’s move to offload its stake in the three companies is the latest in a series of sales of non-core assets by public-sector banks (PSBs) to beef up their capital position. The lender is one of the 11 PSBs under the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) prompt corrective action (PCA) framework and it has been barred from issuing fresh loans. In recent months, other banks under PCA have also resorted to non-core asset sales to boost their non-interest income.
In March, Central Bank of India put on the block a 3.11% stake in JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company. IDBI Bank has moved to sell its entire 30% stake in NSDL E-governance Infrastructure and a 7% stake in National Securities Depository. Bank of India has offloaded its entire 5% stake in credit bureau TransUnion Cibil through a sale of shares to US-based TransUnion International.
PSBs not under PCA are also trying to cash in on their non-core assets. Last month, Punjab National Bank raised `109 crore by selling its stake in rating agency Icra.

"Indian buffaloes are currently exported to about 70 countries. (Express Archive) Indian buffaloes are currently exported to about 70 countries. (Express Archive)
Export of frozen buffalo meat from India is almost a 45-year-old trade. Since the mid-2000s, the country’s annual foreign exchange earnings from it has gone up more than ten times to over $ 4 billion and can, with some policy focus, even double in the next five years.
Buffalo meat processing can, moreover, be the backbone of the dairy industry, if it isn’t already. Like the latter, it has a direct connection with the farmer. It ensures that he gets 30-40% of the cost of his animal as terminal value once its active lactation/reproductive age is over. This money he, then, invests upfront in a new milk-yielding animal.
There’s no better evidence of the above symbiotic relation than Uttar Pradesh , which is India’s largest milk producer and also houses more than half of the country’s 80 standalone and integrated abattoir approved by the Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA). Roughly two-thirds of frozen buffalo meat exports from India is accounted for by UP.
What is striking is that out of the 80 modern abattoir-cum-processing plants, at least 75 have come up in the last 20 years or less. And they have been set up just on the strength of private enterprise, with hardly any government support or concessional bank finance. Unlike dairy, which has received substantial government assistance, including through the World Bank and European Economic Community commodity aid, the buffalo meat processing and export industry hasn’t benefitted from any Operation Flood programme.
Ironically, the dairy industry is today going through an unprecedented crisis, with procurement prices of milk for farmers falling by 25-30% in the last one year. Yet, no thought is being given to the role that the livestock meat industry can play to improve the situation. A country like Australia does not have even a tenth of India’s livestock population, yet its value realisation from meat and live animal exports is more than ours. We as a nation are seriously neglecting our livestock treasure. This, when the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that more than 300 million poor families globally survive on the income from just small ruminants, viz. sheep and goat.
It is about time that the government nurtures the real potential of our livestock wealth. Indian buffalo meat is currently exported to about 70 countries. There is much that the government can do to improve market access. If India can sign an agreement with China to get the latter to open up its market for our rice, why not extend this to buffalo meat as well? A lot of Indian buffalo meat is, in any case, making its way to China through Vietnam.
Why cannot this meat be directly shipped, rather than being routed via a third country — thereby improving our export realisations and enabling our farmers to be paid more for their spent animals?
Similarly, the government can negotiate with Iran, Philippines and Russia, to allow us access to their wet (fresh meat) markets, as against sales only to processors. Also, there should be more aggressive programme for eradication of Foot and Mouth Disease, which can be a game-changer for our exports of both dairy and meat products.
Besides, the Salvaging and Rearing of Male Buffalo Calves Scheme must be revived. We have millions of male buffalo calves coming into the system every year. These animals are, at present, simply allowed to die, when farmers can be incentivised to rear them till they are 23-24 months for sale to abattoir. The scheme started by the Centre, which is currently defunct, was a truly revolutionary one with huge potential to create rural livelihoods and supplement the income of farmers. It is unfortunate that far from promoting an industry, which can help farmers in these times of depressed realisations in most crops, the policy approach is, in fact, negative and counterproductive.
A major byproduct of the setting up of state-of-the-art abattoir in recent times has been the increased availability of good-quality buffalo hide that is freshly flayed, fleshed, salted and folded for supply to the leather industry. But unfortunately, there is a 60% duty on export of raw salted hides produced from even APEDA-approved abattoir. Not only is such a duty unheard of in a world, it forces abattoir to sell this most valuable byproduct of their operations only to domestic tanneries and leather product manufacturers.
The latter, in turn, are permitted to import raw hides and skins duty-free. Isn’t this forced sale of raw hide, at two-thirds of the international price, nothing but subsidisation of the leather industry by meat processors and farmers? And with tanneries in many parts — whether in UP’s Kanpur-Unnao belt or Vellore, Dindigul and Erode districts of Tamil Nadu — closing down due to environmental pollution issues and also being shut during the Kumbh/Magh Mela season in January-February, the effects of a perverse duty are only compounding.
If the government is serious about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of doubling farmers’ income, it should allow the livestock sector to play the role of a genuine facilitator. Milk is today India’s largest crop by value and everyone agrees that dairying is fundamental to doubling farmers’ income. But it is time to recognise that dairy farming cannot sustain itself without a vibrant livestock processing industry. No one knows it better than farmers themselves.

"The group stage encounter in which Mexico defeated the defending world champion Germany had recorded the maximum viewers among individual matches, at 7 million, Sony’s figures said. (Source: Reuters) The group stage encounter in which Mexico defeated the defending world champion Germany had recorded the maximum viewers among individual matches, at 7 million, Sony’s figures said. (Source: Reuters)
SONY Pictures Networks, the official broadcaster of the ongoing FIFA World Cup in India and South East Asia, approached Maharashtra Police last month with an allegation that several websites are illegally streaming the football matches. The channel has submitted a list of 20 such websites and so far, the police have acted against 10, sources said.
The complaint from Sony came in mid-June, days after the group stage matches of the quadrennial tournament started. Police sources said Sony compiled a list of offending websites and approached the police. Figures provided by Sony last week claimed that the first 26 matches reached a total of 117.3 million viewers in India. Of these, 99.3 million were viewers who watched the games on Sony’s television channels and the remaining 18 million had streamed the matches on Sony’s paid online service and the Sony LIV app. The group stage encounter in which Mexico defeated the defending world champion Germany had recorded the maximum viewers among individual matches, at 7 million, Sony’s figures said.
Like with several major sports events, a number of websites are providing free online access to those who have not subscribed to Sony’s services, thereby eating into the broadcaster’s revenues, the police said. Before the tournament, the broadcaster had issued a warning to streaming services violating its exclusive broadcast rights. Sony Pictures Networks declined a request for comment. An officer from cyber police said they are following a six-pronged strategy to attack the ecosystem in which such websites function and incapacitate them. “Normally, when we shut down a particular website, it springs up again from some other domain. We need to ensure that we damage the entire ecosystem in which such websites function,” a senior officer said.
Explaining the strategies, the officer said they first gather information about companies advertising on these websites. “We write to the advertisers and inform them that the websites to which they are paying revenue are engaged in illegal activities. If they continue to place ads, we warn the advertisers that we may include their names as well, if an FIR is registered. Money paid by advertisers is the main source of income for these websites. So, we try to cut that off,” the officer said.
The police also write to domains that host the websites and inform them about illegality. The company is then unwilling to host such websites, the officer said. The police also inform companies through which the website developers receive their payments, and inform them about a culpability on their part.
Apart from writing to these agencies, the police start criminal proceedings in the form of registering FIR or initiating a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) against those running such websites. The police sends compliance notices to those making profits from these sites.
“Lastly, we write to Google to ensure that these websites do not show up at least in the first few pages when people search for streaming websites. These measures are aimed at ensuring that the losses these people incur are more than the gains, thereby making the entire venture unviable” the senior officer said.

"The committee will also look into the liquidation of sugar factories and efforts made by the government for their revival.
The Maharashtra government has established a high-level committee to evaluate the functioning of state’s co-operative sugar mills. The move gains significance in light of the fact that the cooperative sugar sector in the state is dominated by the Congress and NCP and the committee has been appointed ahead of the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls slated for 2019.
Maharashtra cooperation minister Subhash Deshmukh has taken the initiative to find ways to strengthen the cooperative sugar factories in the state. The minister has formed the ‘Mukta Samiti’ with directions to submit a report within two months.
The committee has been entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating the working of cooperative sugar factories and bring on qualitative improvement.The high-level committee will not only evaluate the functioning of the sugar factories but also examine use of government funds, lapses or misuse in its utilisation and action taken by the cooperation department against the offenders.
The committee will also look into the liquidation of sugar factories and efforts made by the government for their revival. The state government has issued a notification in this regard on June 30. The five-member committee is headed by sugar director (finance) Dnyaneshwar Mukne, is expected to submit its report in next two months.
According to senior officials, the government has come across cases where some cooperative organisations and sugar factories, in particular, landed in trouble following gross violation of stipulated norms. The committee has been directed to examine 11 issues in detail and suggest measures to tackle the problems.Some of these include the loopholes in the functioning of factories that could lead to corruption and misappropriation, revival of sick units, how the establishment of cooperative sugar sector has helped to generate jobs and how their farmer members have benefited from such factories.",www.financialexpress.com,2018-07-05 02:09:31,11,244669

"The government’s procurement of grain has steadily increased since 2000. (Express Archive) The government’s procurement of grain has steadily increased since 2000. (Express Archive)
The Narendra Modi government, in its last year in office, has played catch-up with the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance regime vis-à-vis fixing minimum support prices (MSP) for crops. This is especially in paddy and wheat, where the MSPs, unlike for other crops, are reasonably enforced through governmental procurement.
The cumulative MSP increase in paddy during the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance period from 2014-15 — after factoring in the hikes for the current 2018-19 kharif crop season announced on Wednesday — works out to Rs 440 per quintal for ‘common’ and Rs 425 for ‘Grade A’ varieties. This is more than the corresponding Rs 410-415 and Rs 350 increases over the UPA government’s second and first terms, respectively.
In wheat, too, the overall MSP hike in the Modi government’s first four years comes to Rs 335 per quintal, more than the Rs 320 effected during UPA-2, although below the Rs 450 under UPA-1. But with one more rabi season to go before national elections are due in about nine months — wheat is sown in November-December and harvested in April-March — even the UPA-1 cumulative jump could well get surpassed.
What differentiates the Modi government’s MSP hikes from the UPA’s, nevertheless, is its being back-loaded. The entire first three years of its tenure saw the MSP of paddy rise by only Rs 160-165 per quintal, lower than the Rs 180-200 increase just announced for 2018-19. Similarly, the wheat MSP was raised by Rs 50 per quintal in 2014-15 and by Rs 75 in 2015-16, before going up by Rs 100 and Rs 110 in the subsequent two years.
Simply put, the Centre, in its first three years, followed a conservative MSP policy on the lines of the first NDA government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The NDA-1 period witnessed an MSP increase of merely Rs 135 per quintal in paddy and Rs 120 for wheat over its entire six-year tenure (see table).
The Modi government initially not only kept MSP hikes on check — which was consistent with its policy of inflation targeting formalised through an agreement signed with the Reserve Bank of India — but went a step further. In June 2014, it cracked down on state governments that were paying bonuses on top of the Centre’s MSPs.
The states were told that in the event of doing so — the BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh governments were giving farmers Rs 150 and Rs 200 per quintal, respectively, over and above the MSPs for wheat and paddy — the Centre wouldn’t procure beyond their internal public distribution system requirements. Any surplus grain procured would, then, have to be disposed of by the states themselves, who were to also “bear the financial burden in that regard”.
But now, with elections approaching, all caution has seemingly been thrown to the winds. The Chhattisgarh government, in November, declared a Rs 300 per quintal bonus on paddy that was extended not only to the 2017-18, but even the previous year’s crop. MP, likewise, came out with a “special incentive” of Rs 265 per quintal for the 2017-18 wheat, in addition to Rs 200 for the preceding year’s crop. Both states are also headed for Assembly polls in November-December; it remains to be seen whether they would announce bonuses for the current year’s paddy and wheat crops, too, before that.
What are the implications of the latest paddy MSP hike and a likely one for wheat as well?
For one, they will certainly result in more grain being bought by government agencies, as against the private trade. Government procurement of paddy and wheat has, as it is, been rising steadily since the start of this century. The 35.51 million tonnes (mt) of wheat purchased in the recent rabi marketing season accounted for 36% of the total estimated crop of 98.61 mt for 2017-18. Similarly, out of the country’s milled rice production of 111.52 mt, 36.18 mt has already been bought on government account and could reach 38 mt when the current marketing season ends in September.
Secondly, the higher MSPs may also render India’s exports, especially of non-basmati rice, uncompetitive. In 2017-18 (April-March), rice shipments from the country totalled 12.68 mt (8.63 mt of non-basmati and 4.05 mt basmati) and were valued at Rs 49,768.26 crore (Rs 22,927.06 crore of non-basmati and Rs 26,841.19 crore basmati).
Long-grain white rice from Thailand, with 5% brokens content, is now quoting at $ 400-420 per tonne free-on-board (fob), which, at Rs 68.5-to-the-dollar, translates to Rs 27.4-28.8 per kg. If a miller were to purchase paddy from Chhattisgarh or Odisha at the new MSP of Rs 1,750 per quintal, the corresponding rice price at two-thirds recovery will be Rs 26.25 per kg. Even assuming the whole cost of milling, including salaries and overheads, to be recovered from sale of husk and bran, there will be expenses on brokens (bringing down the content from about 20% to 5%), bagging, commission fees, local taxes and transport to ports such as Kakinada. That would take the total export price of Indian non-basmati rice to above Rs 30 per kg or $ 440 per tonne fob.
However, Vijay Setia, president of All India Rice Exporters’ Association, feels that the higher MSP will be absorbed in the global market. “This is because India is the world’s largest rice exporter. It has a near-monopoly over basmati, which anyway commands a premium, and can make buyers pay more even for non-basmati rice,” he says. The US Department of Agriculture has projected total world rice exports for 2018-19 at 49.496 mt, with India’s share at 13 mt, followed by Thailand (11 mt), Vietnam (6.8 mt), Pakistan (4 mt), Myanmar (3.5 mt) and the US (3.3 mt).
But to the extent exports are impacted, there would be that much less paddy/rice bought by private trade. That extra grain would, then, flow into government warehouses.

A Delhi court Wednesday reserved its order on the anticipatory bail plea of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in the case relating to the death of his wife Sunanda Pushkar. Special Judge Arvind Kumar reserved the judgment after Delhi Police opposed Tharoor’s anticipatory bail plea, saying he might “flee the country”.
Tharoor has already been summoned as an accused in the case on July 7 by an Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. Special Public Prosecutor Atul Srivastava said that since Tharoor is an influential person, he may harm the investigation. “He is a frequent flier and may settle abroad. Some of the key witnesses — including Narayan Singh and Bajrangi — are still working with Tharoor and he may influence them,” he said.
However, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Tharoor, told the court that police are making statements contrary to ones made earlier. “In the chargesheet, they (police) said that Tharoor cooperated during the probe and therefore, he was not arrested. Police is speaking contrary to what they were speaking earlier,” Sibal said.
Sibal and Manu Singhvi also told the court that since Tharoor was not arrested before the filing of the chargesheet, he should be given protection from arrest. In his plea, Tharoor had submitted that the SIT had categorically stated that his custodial interrogation was not required.

"The world is going through the process of getting increasingly ready for this digital transformation, he said.
Enterprises around the world are adopting data-driven decision-making models, customers are communicating via mobile and social media platforms. In India too, we are seeing rapid adoption of mobile Internet, cloud technology, digital payments, digital identity etc. “India has the potential to lead in the new era of digitisation,” says Sameer Garde, president, Cisco India & Saarc. “Today, we are doing business with 30,000-35,000 customers. In the next three to five years, we aim to scale it up to 1-1.5 lakh customers, who will digitise or will be forced to digitise because of plummeting data prices and the GST,” he tells Sudhir Chowdhary in an interview. Excerpts:
Are we truly empowered and enabled for transition into this ‘digital world’?
The world is going through the process of getting increasingly ready for this digital transformation. So, if you went back seven or eight years, you probably used one device, sat in one office, and accessed probably couple of applications which were sitting in the datacentre. Seven years later, you are probably using three to four devices, accessing 25 to 30 applications, some from the datacentre, some from the cloud, some paid applications, some non-paid from six or seven different locations in different time zones.
Now for that dynamism to happen, you have to automate this process, which is why you need software. As an employee who needs to be digitally savvy, the question is: Is the infrastructure able to manage this new complexity? Is the IT department able to manage this new complexity from an infrastructure and from software perspective?
The whole concept has changed—how employees are using it, how customers are using applications and from where it is driving this transformation on the infrastructure side. This is not something that we have dreamt, to just suddenly go and innovate on the network. It is basically the customers who are driving us to innovate.
While there is a lot of buzz around SMB customer base and you have also launched Cisco START programme to tap this segment, a majority of them are still unclear about the services. What do you have to say about that?
Cisco START is even more relevant for them. Firstly, data cost has come down significantly. So a lot of them actually use mobile phones to do business now and some of those tools are available for free of cost. If you are a 100-plus people organisation in three or four different locations, you will need some form of meeting or collaboration tool—something you will need to be able to have meetings or to have video conferences or share information with each other. The moment you have a website, an email and some other applications, you become an attack surface or a digital attack surface and hence you will need cyber security for that.
So the point is that as data prices came down and GST became the norm, these SMBs had to digitise. And in their digitisation process, there will be a need for collaboration, security, switches and Wi-Fi and that is what Cisco START is all about.
What is your vision for helping enterprises on their digital transformation journey?
Today, we are doing business with 30,000-35,000 customers. In the next three to five years, we aim to scale it up to 1-1.5 lakh customers, who will digitise or will be forced to digitise because of plummeting data prices and the GST. Further, with the adoption of digital tools, organisations will need security and collaboration solutions. These firms will definitely need automation software to manage scale-ups as they grow.
What does digital transformation mean to Cisco?
India is leading the software transformation with the adoption of intent-based network deployment along with several other cutting edge technologies. To be ahead on the innovation curve, Cisco is reimagining the future by building a digital partner ecosystem. For us, it means two things. One, by being a part of our customers’ digitisation journey, we can help them scale their businesses faster. Two, it means growth for us with digitisation happening at government, SMBs and enterprise level which will spur employment and growth opportunities.
What kind of projects Cisco is working on with the government and private enterprises in India?
On the government side, we started our journey with Smart Cities around three years ago. The government has identified 99 smart cities across the country, out of which contracts for 15 to 16 cities have been awarded with Cisco having mandates for 80% of them. On the enterprise side, a large proportion of our business comes from banking financial services and IT companies. I think we will see a lot more focus in manufacturing and education going forward. My personal passion is to go and see if we can make a big headway in terms of growth and the commercial SMB sector.
How is Cisco differentiating itself from the competition in this space?
What we are currently doing by innovating on the network is having that end-to-end story with customers on the network datacentre with AppDynamics on the application layer. We make sure that you are focused around customer experience, employee experience and the security across all of this. So I don’t think anybody else has that kind of a story and that’s what differentiates us. In addition, it is also about building stronger relationships with our customers and with our partners. That is an entry barrier for a lot of our customers or for a lot of our competitors.
What are the key priorities for Cisco India in 2018-19?
Among our key priorities is to grow commercial business and SMBs faster than the overall business. We also want to continue to grow our reckoning revenue, software and services business must faster than our overall business and partner with the government on Digital 2.0 initiatives. And finally, we aim to continue to reinvent the network, focus on our core and help customers modernise the network.",www.financialexpress.com,2018-07-05 02:00:49,52,245278
"British counterterrorism officers joined a police investigation on Wednesday after two people were found in critical condition from suspected exposure to an unknown substance near the English city where a former Russian spy was poisoned.
Britain’s Sun newspaper reported that the man and woman had been poisoned and were showing similar symptoms to those displayed by ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who were victims of a nerve agent attack in March.
The British pair, a 44-year-old woman and a 45-year-old man, were hospitalised after being found unwell on Saturday in Amesbury, seven miles (11 kilometres) from Salisbury, where the Skripals were found on March 4 slumped unconscious on a bench, after being poisoned with a nerve agent.
Police did not name the couple, but friends have identified the man as Charlie Rowley and the woman as Dawn Sturgess.
“They remain in a critical condition,” Mills said, adding that at least five areas had been cordoned off, including a park and a property in Salisbury, and a pharmacy and a Baptist church community centre in Amesbury.
Samples of the substance involved have been sent to the nearby military research centre of Porton Down for testing, a source close to the investigation said.
“At this stage it is not yet clear if a crime has been committed,” said Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills of Wiltshire Police, who took the rare step of calling it a major incident.
“We are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances regarding this incident,” he told reporters.
Britain blamed the poisoning of the Skripals on Russia, prompting a serious diplomatic crisis between Moscow and Western states. Russia denied any involvement.
A Wiltshire police spokeswoman declined to confirm whether the couple were believed to have been poisoned. But London police confirmed that specialist counterterrorism officers were helping the inquiry.
Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said the government’s emergency response committee had met to discuss the incident and would meet again on Wednesday evening.
Mills said paramedics were called on Saturday morning to a house in Amesbury after the woman collapsed and returned later in the day when the man also fell ill.
The pair, who are being treated at Salisbury District Hospital, were initially believed to have taken heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch, but tests are being conducted to identify the substance involved.
“We are working with the police to understand the circumstances surrounding this incident and it would be inappropriate to make further comment at this time, while we establish how they became unwell,” said Cara Charles-Barks, the hospital’s chief executive.
The hospital is where the Skripals also spent weeks in critical condition before slowly recovering and being discharged.
Britain accused Russia of poisoning Skripal with Novichok nerve agent, the first known offensive use of such a chemical weapon on European soil since the second world war.
Moscow denied any involvement and suggested Britain had carried out the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.
It has said it did not develop Novichok and that it does not possess such nerve agents.
President Vladimir Putin has dismissed as nonsense the notion that Moscow would have poisoned Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter.
The attack prompted the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the cold war as allies in Europe and the United States sided with May’s view that Moscow was either responsible or had lost control of the nerve agent.
Moscow has hit back by expelling Western diplomats, questioning how Britain knows that Russia was responsible and offering its rival interpretations, including that the poisonings were part of a plot by British secret services.

THE Mumbai Police on Tuesday arrested from Haryana the owners of an illegal online lottery, who had been on the run for three months. The police had earlier made nine arrests in the case and had been on the lookout for father-son duo, Ramesh Chaurasia (60) and Aanchal Chaurasia (35), since February, when an FIR had been registered.
The accused allegedly ran the online lottery, called “Game King India”, without being registered with the state government, thereby incurring losses to the state exchequer. The police have managed to get two of the websites, hosted on US servers, through which the lottery operated. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber) Akbar Pathan said: “We have arrested the two accused from Gurugram in Haryana. The duo were produced in the court on Tuesday and remanded in police custody till Thursday.”
An officer said: “The duo kept changing locations and hence it was difficult to track them down.” The police said Aanchal claimed to have completed a course in Information Technology from Canada. The police found the accused have four-five high-end cars and houses in Mumbai and Delhi. An officer linked to the case said once the accused came to know the police were looking for them, they started operating the two websites, http://www.gamekingindia.com and http://www.planetgonline.com, from servers in the US that made it difficult to block them. The father-son duo had area managers who would give access to these games to customers at gaming centres. “We suspected that the system was designed in such a way that most people eventually lost money in the lottery. In lotteries registered with the government, people have to pay a certain amount to the state, which the accused in this case, did not register it,” the officer said.
“They have gaming centres across the country and were arrested by Indore Police last year. In Mumbai, too, they have 19 offences registered against them,” the officer added. The accused have been arrested on charges of cheating and under sections of the Lottery Regulation Act.

"LONDON: Caroline Wozniacki's honeymoon on grass was short-lived as she became the 11th women's seed to fall on the first three days at Wimbledon in a 6-4 1-6 7-5 second-round defeat by Ekaterina Makarova on Wednesday.

Makarova, three days short of her 30th birthday, broke early to take command of the first set.
Wozniacki complained about a swarm of insects on court and asked for repellent spray which seemed to sting her into action as she won five games in a row before claiming the second set.
Makarova came back strongly, however, and looked poised for an easy victory when she led 5-1 in the third.
Wozniacki produced her best tennis, though, to save three match points when 5-3 and 40-0 behind and saved another before breaking to level the set.

Kerala Cabinet on Wednesday decided to amend the Kerala Shops and Establishments Act, to prevent sexual exploitation and provide a more secure environment, especially for women working at shops, hotels and restaurants.
In an official communication, the government said the amended Act would also include a clause to ensure the right of women to sit down during work, a long standing demand of women workers.
The government said it had received several complaints from workers and their trade unions that women were not allowed to sit at shops and other establishments during work. Last year, women workers associated with several leading textile shops in Kerala had staged an agitation demanding their right to sit during the long duty hours.
As per the amendment, if women are put on night shift, between 9 pm and 6 am, then there should be at least a group of five, two of them women. Employers would also have to provide women transport for being dropped at their residences.
As per the laws, women should not be employed for jobs between 7 pm and 6 am. However, the proposed amendments seeks to expunge the section banning employment of women at night.

"The DT 240 Pro comes with a long extendable coiled cord. On both ends are gold plated pins that offer better audio quality. (Representative image)
Don’t you want to hear everything? The sound of the street, the creak of the gate, the sparrows on the roof far away. When you hear a coffee machine, the slow drip of the brew triggers something in your brain. Sound in a sense is a bridge to the other senses, and hence to memories. So there is a value you have to associate with the smaller, quieter notes in life. After all, life is not about the heavy, overpowering notes which, though enjoyable, are also superficial.
There are headphones and there are professional quality monitoring headphones such as the Beyerdynamic DT 240 Pro. These are on-ear monitoring earphones meant for those who work in the audio industry or other fields where your mind needs to use a headphone for long hours. It is also for those dependent on the smaller notes to make a difference to whatever they do.
The DT 240 Pro comes with a long extendable coiled cord. On both ends are gold plated pins that offer better audio quality. Also, the cord is detachable from headphones in case you want to fold them flat while travelling. Interestingly, both earcups have ports for the cord so that you can plug into whichever you think is convenient. The earcups are comfortable when you are wearing it for long hours and keep most of the irritating noises away.
But in the end, a headphone such as the DT 240 Pro is all about the audio quality. The DT 240 Pro offers a deeply rich audio profile that is usually not available on all headphones of this size or price band. In fact, I used the headphones to binge-watch the first series of Hannibal on Netflix during a rather long flight and the experience was so immersive I could head a lot of sounds I would have missed with earphones or wireless headsets. Even with music, while hearing a tabla play, the sounds are richer and more visual because of the sheer space each channel seems to get.
However, since the headphones are meant for professional use, these sport basic features and don’t come with either volume controls on the cord or microphone. Well, those who buy this set don’t need any of those. Anyway, I think given the quality of the audio playback, this should appeal to a lot more people. In fact, I would suggest buying these instead of costlier audiophile headphones as there is not much to differentiate the experience.

The Delhi High Court Wednesday expressed displeasure at the poor condition of toilets and other facilities at Mahatma Gandhi’s memorial at Rajghat, saying it was a “disservice to the memory of the father of the nation”.
A bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said, “This place is worshipped and visited by VVIPs and dignitaries, including heads of states and national and international leaders. Everyone, including government officials, first go to Rajghat, and then India Gate.”
The court asked the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) to prepare a list of trees planted at Rajghat in tabular format, with details comprising the date on which each tree was planted, name of the dignitary who planted it, the type of each tree planted, and current status of each tree.
It also directed the CPWD to complete physical inspection of the trees by July 26. The bench directed that the deputy director general (horticulture) should be present in court to tell the bench about the steps taken to preserve trees.

"Pakistan beat Zimbabwe to book a place in the tri-series final. (AP Photo) Pakistan beat Zimbabwe to book a place in the tri-series final. (AP Photo)
Pakistan had five balls to spare when it beat Zimbabwe by seven wickets on Wednesday and eliminated the African host from the Twenty20 tri-series tournament.
Solomon Mire missed out on the chance to become Zimbabwe’s first century-maker in a T20 international as his 94-run knock carried Zimbabwe to 162-4 after captain Hamilton Masakadza lost his first toss in the tri-series and his team was put in to bat.
Opener Fakhar Zaman (47) and Hussain Talat (44) led Pakistan to 163-3 in 19.1 overs against an inexperienced bowling attack as Pakistan registered its second win against Zimbabwe. It was Zimbabwe’s third straight loss.
Australia plays against Pakistan on Thursday before both teams meet in Sunday’s final.
Mire stood tall against Pakistan’s full-strength attack as left-arm fast bowler Mohammad Amir (1-25) got his first game of the series and replaced Usman Khan.
Mire and Cephas Zhuwao (24) provided a solid opening partnership of 49 runs before Tarisai Musakanda (33) added 64 runs for the third wicket with Mire.
Mire, who hit six sixes and six fours, reached his half-century off 32 balls when he hoisted left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz for a six over long off in the 11th over.
Pakistan struggled for wickets despite seamer Faheem Ashraf (1-24) and leg-spinner Shadab Khan (1-28) bowling a decent four overs each in the middle overs.
Mire looked set to become the first Zimbabwe batsman to score a century in a Twenty20 before he holed out at deep mid-wicket off seamer Talat in the 18th over _ only a ball after Asif Ali missed a sitter at deep square leg.
Mire also featured in two dismissals during Pakistan’s innings as he took a fine catch in the deep to dismiss Haris Sohail. He then denied Zaman a half century through his medium pace when the left-hander was caught at mid-on.
Captain Sarfraz Ahmed (38 not out) and experienced Shoaib Malik (12 not out) kept their composure and carried Pakistan home.
Ahmed was not happy with his bowlers, saying it “was not up to the mark, they have to work hard.”

"The crack on the bridge on Grant Road. Karma Sonam Bhutia The crack on the bridge on Grant Road. Karma Sonam Bhutia
A day after an overbridge collapsed in Andheri, a railway bridge on Grant Road was shut for around six hours on Wednesday after motorists spotted a crack and uploaded pictures of it on social media.
A crack on Frere Bridge, which is over Grant Road railway station, was noticed by motorists early on Wednesday. The bridge connects Nana Chowk to Lamington Road and continues to Maulana Shaukat Ali Road.
After motorists posted pictures of the crack on social media, the Railways and Brihanmumbai Municipality Corporation officials visited the site to examine it and shut the bridge to vehicular traffic as precaution. Traffic was diverted to Kennedy Bridge and motorists were asked to take the route to travel towards Opera House and beyond.
Around 2 pm, after an examination was conducted, traffic was allowed on the bridge, the police said. “Railways and BMC officials found that the crack was not deep and filled it. Traffic was allowed on the bridge again and situation stabilised after some time,” said Ashok Dudhe, the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic (City). Meanwhile, Western Express Highway and S V Road in the western suburbs saw heavy traffic and congestion after Gokhale bridge in Andheri was shut for repairs following Tuesday’s incident.
With the police diverting traffic to S V Road, Milan Subway, Andheri subway and Vile Parle flyover, movement of traffic was slow on the stretches.

"LONDON: Roger Federer extended his flawless winning streak at Wimbledon to 26 consecutive sets as the defending champion crushed Lukas Lacko, while Serena Williams powered to her 16th successive win in Wednesday's (Jul 4) second round action.
While Federer and Serena strolled, Caroline Wozniacki suffered fresh Wimbledon woe as the world number two suffered a shock 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 defeat against Ekaterina Makarova.

Federer delivered a Centre Court masterclass lasting 89 minutes as the Swiss star hit 48 winners and 16 aces in his 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 victory.
The 36-year-old is now on his joint second longest streak of sets won at Wimbledon -- his best was 34 between the third round in 2005 to the 2006 final.
Next up for Federer is a third round tie against German world number 64 Jan-Lennard Struff who came back from two sets down to defeat 39-year-old Ivo Karlovic 13-11 in the final set.
In his 20th Wimbledon appearance, top seed Federer, a 20-time major winner, is bidding to become only the second player to claim nine singles titles at the All England Club after Martina Navratilova.

On the evidence of his ruthless demolition of Slovakian world number 73 Lacko, it will take something special to stop Federer making more Wimbledon history.
""I played very well. I felt good out there, less nerves than in the first round,"" Federer said.
""I'm happy how I am hitting the ball, good concentration on my service games and able to mix it up with some slices.
""Of course, you sometimes play the percentages, but if you do that too much it becomes boring, so I like to mix it up.""
Federer wasn't the only former champion in peak form on Centre Court as seven-time winner Serena routed Bulgarian qualifier Viktoriya Tomova 6-1, 6-4.
Williams brushed aside Tomova in just 66 minutes with 24 winners and four aces to extend her streak of consecutive match wins at the All England Club.
""It was better than the first round. I'm happy I'm going in the right direction,"" Serena said.
""I'm getting there. I expect to get there, not only for Wimbledon but for the tournaments in the future.""
'EATING BUGS'
The 36-year-old, whose winning run encompasses her Wimbledon titles in 2015 and 2016, missed the grass-court Grand Slam last year while she prepared to give birth to daughter Alexis Olympia in September.
Serena, seeded 25th after her return from maternity leave, faces France's Kristina Mladenovic or Germany's Tatjana Maria for a place in the last 16.
Wozniacki, plagued by an invasion of flying ants during the Court One clash, saved five match points but has now failed to get past the last 16 in 12 visits to the All England Club.
It was a bitter defeat for the 27-year-old Dane, who was expected to challenge for the Wimbledon title after winning her maiden Grand Slam crown at the Australian Open in January.
With flying ants stuck in Wozniacki's hair and dive-bombing her throughout the match, the former world number one asked the umpire if there was something that could be sprayed to keep the bugs away.
""They're in my mouth and in my hair and everywhere - we need to do something. Is there a spray?"" she said.
""I want to be here to focus on tennis, not eating bugs.""
Five-time champion Venus Williams battled into the third round with a 4-6, 6-0, 6-1 win over Romanian qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru.
Venus reached her ninth Wimbledon final last year, but the American star was denied a sixth title by Garbine Muguruza.
Making her 21st Wimbledon appearance, 38-year-old Venus is the oldest woman in this year's tournament.
But she didn't look her age in making it 89 career match wins at Wimbledon by demolishing Dulgheru in the final two sets.
Asked if her wealth of Wimbledon experience was a key factor, Venus said: ""I'd love to have that extra advantage. If that's working for me I'm all for it.
""It's just about winning the match. If that's your best or not doesn't matter.""
Venus next faces Dutch 20th seed Kiki Bertens, who beat Russian world number 107 Anna Blinkova 6-4, 6-0.
Former world number one Karolina Pliskova finally made it to the third round on her seventh visit to Wimbledon after seeing off two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka 6-3, 6-3.

"Gauri Lankesh murder case: Suspected shooter held, police say he has a crime record Gauri Lankesh murder case: Suspected shooter held, police say he has a crime record
When Amit Degwekar, 38, a resident of the radical Hindutva group Sanatan Sanstha’s ashram in Ponda, Goa, was arrested in May this year for the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of Karnataka Police had found in his possession several envelopes with varying amounts of cash. The money came to over Rs 1.5 lakh.
The cash found in the envelopes had been withdrawn from a Sanatan Sanstha bank account and were meant to be given to field workers associated with a covert activities unit of the ultra-right wing Hindutva group, allegedly involved in assassinations and subversion in Karnataka and Maharashtra, the SIT has surmised following investigations after the arrest of Degwekar and four others for direct involvement in Lankesh’s murder.
READ | SIT finds outfit linked to Hindutva group had 60 on rolls to fuel violence
A bank pass book of the Sanstha account from where the money was drawn was found in Degwekar’s possession, it is learnt.
A promoter and editor of ‘Sanatan Prabhat’, a publication of the Sanstha, Degwekar, who worked ostensibly under supervision of a senior member of the Hindutva outfit, has been identified by SIT as a channel for funds to a covert activities group headed by Amol Kale, 37, a Pune resident and former convenor of Sanstha-affiliate Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS).
The probe has so far found that besides serving as a direct link for the covert group to the Sanatan Sanstha, Degwekar was also closely associated with Kale in plotting Lankesh’s murder. They ostensibly travelled together on one occasion to study her daily movements in the lead-up to the murder on the evening of September 5, 2017. Lankesh had at the time just returned from work to her home in Bengaluru.

Degwekar was arrested along with Kale and Manohar Edave, 29, a Karnataka resident, from Davangere in southern Karnataka in May this year. The SIT arrested them on the basis of information from a former HJS activist identified as Sujeet Kumar, 38.
The SIT had arrested Sujeet for allegedly playing a central role in organising logistics for the murder.

A resident at Sanatan Sanstha’s ashram for several years, Degwekar, according to investigators, was a roommate of Malgonda Patil, one of the two Sanstha men killed in October 2009 in a blast in Madgaon, Goa.

He was at the time allegedly ferrying an IED to plant it at a Diwali celebration that was opposed by the Sanstha for apparently being against Hindu belief.
The SIT says Degwekar is currently the only direct link between the Lankesh assassination plot and the Sanstha, although several others arrested have had strong links to the Sanstha in the past, or have been associated with the outfit through splinter radical Hindutva groups such as the Hindu Yuva Sena or Sri Rama Sena.
According to sources in SIT, the envelopes carrying cash found with Degwekar were meant to be given to field workers co-opted into the radical unit — such as Parashuram Waghmare, 26, who was recruited from Sri Rama Sena in Vijayapura to shoot Lankesh; and K T Naveen Kumar, 37, recruited from Hindu Yuva Sena in Maddur to allegedly provide logistics for the murder.
In the course of his interrogation, Degwekar has reportedly claimed that cash found on him were payments made by subscribers of Sanatan Sanstha’s publications, which he claimed to promote by travelling around the country.
“My brother has been wrongly arrested. He is a member of Sanatan Sanstha for a decade now. He lives and works at the Sanatan Sanstha ashram in Goa,” Degwekar’s brother Viraj had said after his arrest in May.
Sanstha spokesperson Chethan Rajhans has stated: “Amit Degwekar promoted ‘Sanatan Prabhat’ – he used to come to the ashram for that work. The Sanstha is involved in spiritual enhancement of Hindus. We are not killers.”
Since identifying Parashuram Waghmare as the man who pulled the trigger on Lankesh and arresting him on June 11, the SIT has found that he was paid around Rs 13,000 to cover expenses after the murder. The assassin was also given a similar amounts by Kale after he was recruited two years ago and trained in 2017 in firing guns, sources said.
The probe has found that the men in charge of the covert activities group like Kale went to great lengths to ensure that operatives at the lower levels like Waghmare and Naveen Kumar had access to only a minimum amount of information about the assassination plots they were roped into.
On two occasions he came to Bengaluru — in July 2017 for a recce and in September 2017 for the murder — Waghmare was apparently taken blindfolded to hideouts.

The Chhattisgarh Leader of Opposition and Congress leader T S Singhdeo has written to Assembly Speaker Gaurishankar Agrawal, seeking the disqualification of three party MLAs — Amit Jogi, Siyaram Kaushik and RK Rai — under the Anti-Defection Law, even as Jogi claimed that the move displayed the “nervousness” of the party. Agarwal on Tuesday told the House that he has received Singhdeo’s letter and was considering the documents.
Amit Jogi and his father Ajit, the first chief minister of Chhattisgarh between 2000 and 2003, had left the Congress after they were accused of working against the interest of the party in the 2014 Antagarh bypoll. In 2016, the father-son duo announced the formation of the Chhattisgarh Janata Congress (CJC) and posted it as a regional alternative to the BJP and Congress.
While several leaders from the Congress joined the Jogis and then returned to the party folds, Rai and Kaushik have been steadfast supporters of the Jogis, appearing at CJC events as senior members of the party.
Questioning the timing of the letter, Amit Jogi said the move only displayed the “nervousness of the Congress”.
“The election is tomorrow and today you are saying defection. This should have been done two years ago, but now it means nothing but a display of their fear,” he said.

"Several bidders, including Liberty Global, are preparing offers for TV production company Endemol Shine, maker of classic reality show 'Big Brother' and the dystopian 'Black Mirror' dramas, before an initial deadline next week.
FRANKFURT/LONDON: Several bidders, including Liberty Global, are preparing offers for TV production company Endemol Shine, maker of classic reality show 'Big Brother' and the dystopian 'Black Mirror' dramas, before an initial deadline next week.
ITV, RTL Group's FremantleMedia and Lions Gate Entertainment are also eyeing Netherlands-based Endemol, sources close to the matter said, in a deal that comes as the rise of streaming giants Netflix and Amazon Prime has thrown the industry into turmoil.

The sellers are aiming for a price tag of between 2.5 and 3 billion euros (US$2.9-US$3.5 billion), said one banker familiar with the process, but this may prove ambitious with bids expected to be in the 2-2.5 billion euro range.
That works out at roughly 10 times core earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which a second banker said would be the most the seller could hope to get.
A source close to one potential buyer said Endemol's catalog was heavy with ageing formats, making it potentially less attractive than buying small production outfits and working directly with top creative talent.
This person, who like other sources spoke on condition of anonymity, also said Endemol carried sizable debts and had already gone through a round of cost cutting, meaning the potential for synergies with an acquirer might be limited.

""We're interested, yes, but skeptical,"" this person said. ""Is Endemol really a creative company any more? It's financially weak.""
Endemol declined to comment. Its owners, private equity firm Apollo Global and Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
HUNGER FOR QUALITY
The sale comes as traditional TV players need more quality scripted serials to fill their fledgling video-on-demand services, with binge-watching online viewers less likely to be satisfied with their staple fare of reality and lifestyle shows.

It also creates an opening for Liberty, the U.S. telecoms and pay-TV company built by John Malone, to leverage its distribution expertise and assets.
Liberty may bid for Endemol via All3Media, the production joint venture it owns together with Discovery Inc, CEO Mike Fries said at a recent industry gathering.
""It would be surprising if we didn't look at it through All3Media,"" Fries told C21 Media, adding Liberty would continue to ""get its feet wet"" through content deals.
Discovery, for its part, has joined forces with Germany's ProSiebenSat 1 Media to build a German streaming TV platform and has invited others to join.
France's Banijay Group, in which Vivendi owns a minority stake, may also join the contest for Endemol, another source said.
Liberty, Discovery, ITV, Banijay, Vivendi and RTL - controlled by Germany's Bertelsmann - all declined to comment. Los Angeles-based Lionsgate, which has movie and TV divisions, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.S. Independence Day holiday.
Apollo Global and Fox have hired Deutsche Bank and Liontree to advise on the deal.
They are ready to sell Endemol outright, although a potential buyer may seek a deal in which Fox retains a minority, said one banker familiar with the process.
Liberty has just agreed the US$22 billion sale of its telecoms assets in Germany and central Europe to Vodafone and, assuming the deal clears antitrust scrutiny, will be looking to reinvest some of the proceeds.
Britain's ITV and ProSieben are more financially constrained and would have to raise cash for a bid, a second banker said, while RTL, the European broadcaster, may lack the appetite for a big deal.

"Chancellor Angela Merkel and her defence minister on Wednesday vowed to continue boosting German military spending after years of cutbacks that have reduced military readiness and drawn the ire of some NATO partners, including the United States.
BERLIN: Chancellor Angela Merkel and her defence minister on Wednesday vowed to continue boosting German military spending after years of cutbacks that have reduced military readiness and drawn the ire of some NATO partners, including the United States.
Merkel told lawmakers she welcomed increases already planned in military spending, but said it was ""certainly not sufficient"" when compared to the percentage of gross domestic product other countries spent on their defences.

To catch up, Merkel and Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen have pledged to boost German military spending to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2024. Both said they remained committed to achieving the NATO target of spending 2 percent at a later date.
""It would be reckless not to prepare for alliance defence,"" Merkel told lawmakers.
Germany will boost military spending in 2019 by 4 billion euros to 42.9 billion euros, its fourth successive year increase, von der Leyen told lawmakers. She said the increase would amount to a 30 percent increase from 2014 to 2019.
By 2024, German military spending would have increased 80 percent, von der Leyen said.

The 2019 increase brings German military spending to 1.31 percent of economic output up from 1.24 percent, although the longer-range plan calls for the percentage to drop back to around 1.23 percent by 2022.
Von der Leyen said Germany could be proud of its contributions to the NATO alliance despite recent ""tweets and letters"" - a reference to recent missives from U.S. President Donald Trump rebuking key allies for spending too little on their militaries.
Trump will tell fellow NATO countries at next week's summit that the United States cannot be ""the world's piggy bank,"" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said on Tuesday aboard the presidential aircraft Air Force One.
""That’s gotta stop,"" Gidley told reporters as Trump flew to West Virginia.
Von der Leyen noted that Germany is the second largest net contributor for NATO command structures, and said it was the only country from continental Europe to lead a battalion in eastern Europe as part of a NATO programme initiated after Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.
Von der Leyen also rejected media reports suggesting that the United States was planning to pull troops out of Germany, adding, ""There is no evidence whatsoever that there are plans to withdraw troops.""

Following the Supreme Court verdict on the powers and limits of Lieutenant Governor on Wednesday, Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy said the order applies to the Union territory too and it is time for L-G Kiran Bedi to stop creating hindrance in governance. In Puducherry, a stand-off similar to Delhi between Chief Minister Narayanasamy and L-G Kiran Bedi has been affecting smooth functioning of the government for the past two years.
Narayanasamy said the order proves that whatever he has been writing to the Prime Minister and Union Ministry of Home Affairs for the past two years is true. “Prime Minister never replied to my letters. Home Minister never acted on them. Now the time has come for us to fulfil the projects we promised. We thank the judiciary. L-G Bedi cannot come up with anymore hindrances,” he said.
The Chief Minister said attempts to curtail powers of the elected government in Puducherry will not be allowed. “What all the Supreme Court said in the verdict today applies for Puducherry too. Hereafter, the LG here shouldn’t be calling officials at her office for review meetings, she has to stop it from today. I am the CM for two years now. I was fighting for these rights,” he said.
Narayanasamy warned he would file a contempt petition if the L-G failed to act in accordance with the SC order. “Whoever functions contrary to the judgment now delivered by the apex court would face serious action. I myself would file contempt petition against those failing to act in consonance with the supreme court verdict,” he said.
Among major issues he faced due to LG Bedi’s style of functioning was the long delay in clearing files, Narayanasamy told The Indian Express. “She had this practice of raising queries at files, and she will do it repeatedly on each file even if the queries were replied once or twice. She used to summon officials too in her office. Hereafter, she may call the concerned secretary or the elected representative if she has a query on files. It is time for her to stop calling officials at the rank of under secretary, joint secretary and head of the departments, in the name of review meetings. The SC verdict is clear on all these aspects,” he said.
Bedi created around 20 WhatsApp groups including top government officials and gave directions to officials in different hierarchical structures. The CM was forced to call a meeting of top officials in July 2016 to remind them to not bypass ministers. L-G Bedi was also outspoken on Twitter about the righteousness of her actions, and in one such tweet tagging the Prime Minister’s Office in January 2017, she had summarily cancelled an order by the Chief Minister barring government officials from using social media for official purposes.

A 27-year-old man was allegedly shot at by two armed assailants in south Delhi’s Yusuf Sarai market Wednesday, a few metres from General Raj’s Shankaran Memorial School. Police said the victim, Sajjan Kumar, received two gunshot injuries and is recovering at Safdarjung Hospital.
According to police, CCTV footage showed that the assailants started following the victim, a collection agent in a private company, from Jangpura.
“The incident took place around 9.45 am when the victim, after collecting a payment of Rs 3 lakh from his clients, was heading to a bank to deposit it. He first dropped his father in Jangpura, and then came to Green Park on his bike. While he was parking his bike outside Gujjar Dairy in Yusuf Sarai market, he was intercepted by two persons,” said a senior police officer.
Eyewitnesses told police that the assailants tried to snatch his bag, but he resisted. “One of them took out a pistol and opened fire at him. Kumar collapsed and the assailants fled the spot,” said an officer.
DCP (south) Romil Baaniya said the assailants fired two rounds, one of which hit the victim’s thumb and the other his ear.
“Locals told police about the incident. Kumar was carrying a bag with Rs 1.30 lakh in cash and a cheque, all of which were recovered intact, along with his mobile phone. We are investigating the case from all possible angles and an FIR under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 has been registered at Hauz Khas police station,” he added. The caretaker of a nearby building said that despite being shot twice, Kumar did not let go of his bag and saved the money.

The first green helicopter (ALH Mk-III) earmarked for Indian Coast Guard has completed its fitting at state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, with installation of basic systems and a successful maiden ground run recently. ‘Green’ in technical term as it is a basic helicopter, the indigenous Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) ‘Dhruv’ is a veritable tour de force of the Indian Coast Guard (ICG). It has now been handed over to the Rotary Wing Research & Development Centre (RWR&DC), a design house of HAL for integration and certification of 19 new systems. These new systems include 12.7mm Cabin Mounted Gun, Surveillance Radar, SAR Homer, Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Automatic Identification System (AIS), Loud Hailer, Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU), Automatic Deployable Emergency and Locator Transmitter (ADELT).
Since its induction in 2002, the four versatile Dhruv helicopters have been extensively deployed by ICG for various roles such as search and rescue (SAR), casualty evacuation, armed patrol, coastal surveillance, VIP movement and night SAR and have proved their mettle in critical missions.
To further boost their Low Intensity Maritime Operations (LIMO) and Coast Security capabilities, the ICG signed a contract in March 2017 for supply of 16 ALHs (Fixed Wheel) in a five-year time frame.
Director General Rajendra Singh, Indian Coast Guard, received the contract documents from T Suvarna Raju, CMD, HAL during the event held to mark the occasion.
According to Raju, for the first time, HAL has entered into a contract with ICG that includes Performance Based Logistics (PBL) support after the delivery of helicopters for five years worth `2,244 crore. PBL is the purchase of logistics support as an integrated, affordable, performance package designed to optimise system readiness and meet performance goals for the product through long-term support arrangements with clear lines of authority and responsibility. PBL is emerging as a preferred acquisition strategy for defence acquisition and asset management, as it ensures the product uptime availability to the customer, while the responsibility gets transferred to the supplier.
The certified helicopter deliveries are scheduled to commence from 2020 onwards. This contract gives a boost to the government’s Make-in-India initiative while reaffirming ALH Dhruv’s significant role in helping the ICG ensure safer lives, safer coastlines and safer seas.",www.financialexpress.com,2018-07-05 01:34:16,13,244215
"CCTV footage has established that there is no role of an outsider in the deaths, says report.

New Delhi: The mysterious death of 11 family members in north Delhi’s Burari continue to leave investigators looking for possible angles that prompted the Bhatia family to hang themselves on Saturday night.
CCTV footage has established that there is no role of an outsider in the deaths, reports NDTV.
The security footage recovered from a CCTV camera installed opposite the house shows a woman and two children of the family bringing in the stools and wires used in the mass hangings. The stool was one of the five used in the mass hangings.
All the members apparently died together around 1 am.
The evidence also indicates that the family didn't expect to die and that they had believed they would ""emerge stronger"" after a bizarre mass ritual.
The footage accessed by NDTV gives glimpses of a family voluntarily following the instructions of a man possessed - Lalit, 45, the younger son of the 77-year-old matriarch Narayan Devi.
The diary notes were his, and indicate that Lalit hallucinated about his father, who died 10 years ago, advising him on salvation.
According to the report, another person who wrote in the diaries was Lalit's 30-year-old niece Priyanka, who had been engaged on June 17 and was scheduled to get married later this year.
The diary notes, accessed by NDTV, also show that the family may have thought the spirit of Lalit's father would save them. The last sentence in the final diary, written on the day of the suicides, read: ""...keep water in a cup, when it changes colour, I will appear and save you."" After the ""ritual"", everyone was to untie each other.
Footage also shows that the family's youngest, 12-year-old Dhruv and 15-year-old Shivam, went to a furniture store downstairs and brought the wires used in the hangings. They were tied up by their parents.
On Sunday morning, 10 members of the family, including the schoolboys, were found hanging in the hallway. The wires were hung from a grill in a manner that could be managed only by an insider with access to the roof, the police say.
The members were blindfolded, gagged and bound - except Lalit's wife Tina, who may have tied up all the others. The 11th member, Narayan Devi, was found dead on the floor. Nine members had shared five stools, reports NDTV.
""This was a final thanksgiving to the spirits,"" said a police officer, explaining that the family had attributed a run of good fortune to Lalit's instructions. Their finances had improved drastically and Priyanka had been engaged after a long struggle to find a match.
In the final diary entry on June 30 (Saturday), there were instructions titled ""Bhagwaan ka raasta (Road to God)"". It said nine people would hang from the ""jaal"" (a grill) and one person, ""Baby"" - the widowed sister of Lalit and his older brother Bhuvanesh - would be near the mandir (temple), on a smaller stool.
The notes detailed the exact time for specific tasks; food had to be ordered at 10 pm, ""mother would feed everyone roti"" and the ""kriya (final act)"" would be performed at 1 am.
The faces, ears and eyes were to be covered with ""doctor's patti (bandage)"".
The steps were followed to the second, according to the timeline pieced together by the police with help from the diary notes and CCTV footage.
10:00 pm - The older daughter-in-law of the family brings in the stools.
10:15 pm - The boys, Dhruv and Shivam, bring the wires used in the hangings.
10:39 pm - 20 rotis ordered by the family are delivered.
10:57 pm - Bhuvanesh, the older son of Narayan Devi, takes the dog for a walk.
11:04 pm - The man and the dog return to their home.
5:56 am (July 1) - Truck leaves behind milk cartons, which remain untouched.
7:14 am - Neighbour enters and finds the bodies.
The police are investigating the theory of shared psychotic disorder that could have led to the mass suicide.",www.asianage.com,2018-07-05 01:32:00,36,236694
"A suburban local train passes the site of the collapse in Andheri on Wednesday. Santosh Parab A suburban local train passes the site of the collapse in Andheri on Wednesday. Santosh Parab
An AUDIT in November last year was not the only recent examination conducted on GK Gokhale Bridge in Andheri that collapsed on Tuesday morning. A pre-monsoon inspection of all bridges on railway properties conducted had also not found the bridge posing any risk. Conceding that the inspection conducted three months ago did not identify the bridge as dangerous, senior railway officials are now contemplating revising the parameters for such examination.
Officials admitted that the November audit had rated the bridge at “4”, meaning it was not found to be in a distressed condition. It is a rating for bridges considered to be in “average-to-good condition”. “There are other foot overbridges and road overbridges that are in poorer shape than Gokhale Bridge. In discussions conducted, only routine maintenance was suggested for this particular bridge, which could have been carried out after a certain period of time. That is why it was rated 4 in a rating of 0-5, with 0 being marked for bridges in ‘distressed condition’”, said senior railway official.
After November 2017, the bridge was again inspected in April 2018, by an assistant engineer. While corrosion had been noted, no major discrepancy was noticed during the audit. “While Gokhale Bridge was inspected in November last year by the then divisional engineer, bridges, it was inspected in April 2018 as well, by an assistant engineer who assumes the role of a supervisor. As an inspection conducted by an officer is valued, any work required to be done on the bridge will be based on the rating given by the officer,” a senior official said.
On the suburban section, the railways conducts inspection of bridges at night. Officials claimed that such inspections are conducted “visually” where the maximum level of corrosion is checked, followed by rivet-testing where screws are hammered and checked if they are fit tightly.
“After the Gokhale Bridge incident, there is a greater need to revise the rules for conducting inspection of bridges. While the procedure is laid down, it could be more thorough. We need to look at more modern ways of conducting bridge inspections,” a senior railway official said. Declaring a bridge “structurally weak” by only observing corrosion might not be an appropriate technique, he added.
On Tuesday, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal ordered the IIT, Mumbai, to conduct an audit of bridges in co-ordination with the Railways and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and submit a report within six months. But the Western Railway (WR) will inspect each of the bridges, for structural strength, in the next three months. “We found 63 cable wires running along Gokhale Bridge, of which, 75 per cent had not received No-Objection Certificate from the Railways. We will now locate such bridges where cable wires are placed without informing the Railways. Strict action will be taken,” a senior WR official said.
The Commissioner of Railway Safety, Western Circle, Sushil Chandra, who inspected the accident site on Wednesday, is expected to submit a preliminary report within a month. “We are still collecting information on the bridge. Our investigation will look into the details of the audit conducted by the Railways on Gokhale Bridge,” Chandra said.
On Wednesday, train services on WR were disrupted after speed restrictions were imposed between Andheri and Vile Parle stations, as debris was being cleared from the site. “Some slow trains had to be cancelled due to the speed restriction. Operation would be smooth by Thursday,” an official said.

(Express Photo by Amit Mehra) On Tuesday, the apex court had said it was “shocking” that thousands of seats went uncontested in the Bengal panchayat elections held in May. (Express Photo by Amit Mehra)
The Supreme Court on Wednesday questioned the West Bengal Election Commission over its decision to revoke an order extending the deadline for filing nominations for the recently concluded Bengal panchayat polls, just a day after it had extended it. “Why did you first extend the deadline for filing the nomination papers and later take back the decision,” a bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud asked the counsel for the poll panel.
The Commission, in the wake of complaints by candidates that they were unable to file nomination papers, had on April 9 extended the deadline for filing nomination papers till 3 pm the next day. However, it withdrew the order the next morning. The apex court observed that the deadline was extended after the Commission received complaints regarding the problems in filing nomination papers, and sought to know if any enquiry was conducted before the order was revoked.
“Did you make an enquiry about the situation at the ground level before taking back the decision,” the court asked. As senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Amrendra Sharan, who were appearing for the Commission, requested the bench to permit it to declare the results for seats that were duly contested, the top court said it will pass an order in the matter after hearing the poll panel again on August 6.
On Tuesday, the apex court had said it was “shocking” that thousands of seats went uncontested in the Bengal panchayat elections held in May. The court was hearing an appeal filed by the state election commission (SEC) against the High Court order asking it to accept the nomination papers filed through email for the panchayat elections. Of a total 58,692 posts for gram panchayat village, zilla parishad and panchayat samiti, 20,159 of them had remained uncontested in the violence-marred local polls.

"A terrapin and a red panda have made it to critical list. (Thinkstock) A terrapin and a red panda have made it to critical list. (Thinkstock)
FOUR SPECIES that are one step away from becoming extinct in the wild have been included in the Centre’s Recovery Programme for Critically Endangered Species.
They are Northern Indian Terrapin (Batagur baska), Clouded Leopard, Arabian Sea Humpback Whale and Red Panda.
Under the International Union for Conservation of Species (IUCN), Critically Endangered Species are those facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild, and the centre’s recovery programme charts out species-specific plan to salvage the animals’ numbers. The programme, which already covers 17 species across the country, includes legal sanction against hunting, financial assistance to states to protect the species, creation of sanctuaries, and even the CBI’s assistance in prosecuting the poachers.
The four species were recommended to be included by the Wildlife Division of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), and was approved by the Standing Committee of the National Board of Wildlife (NBWL) last month. The recommendations were made by chief wildlife wardens of east and northeast regions of India.
Norther River Terrapin, which is a species of riverine turtle found in the rivers that flow in Eastern India, is hunted for its meat and carapace. It is a native of Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Clouded Leopard, found in the Himalayan foothills, is threatened due to habitat loss, poaching for its skin and is also as a live pet trade. “The IUCN has categorized the species as ‘Vulnerable’ and indicates a ‘declining trend in its population, as per its Red List assessment of 2016,” the minutes of the meeting note.

Arabian Sea Humpback Whale is a species found in all of major oceans but ship strikes, unforgiving fishing gear and siesmic exploarations pose grave threat to it. “International studies on the whales have indicated that the species migrates from the Oman coast through the Arabian sea, along the Indian coasts till the Sri Lankan coast,” the minutes note.
Red Panda which is closely associated with montane forests with dense bamboo-thicket, is found Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh. It is poached for its meat, and for use in medicines, and as a pet. “The IUCN has categorized Red Panda as ‘Endangered’ and as per their Red List assessment of 2015, the population of the species is ‘decreasing,” the minutes note.
NBWL standing committee member Dr H S Singh told The Indian Express recovery of a species cannot be achieved in the last stage when the population dwindles to critical levels. “The recovery then becomes almost difficult or impossible. When the species starts to decline, it takes time to put measures in place.there is a gestation period which means at least two to three years before the recovery plan is rolled out.”
Singh said in the meeting that except for a few cases, most of the recovery activities are restricted to study/research and monitoring stage. Though the recovery plan for the Great Indian Bustard and lesser florican was discussed two years ago and plan was also sanctioned with financial allocation however the recovery plan is yet to take off.
“Chief ministers have to agree, states have to agree to actually be able to roll out a programme. Preparing a plan, deliberate over it, figure out where breeding centres can be set up.it is a gestation period of at least two years. We should not wait for species reaching to Critically Endangered or Endangered level,” he said.

"NEW YORK (AP) — Whitney Houston's mother had no clue about allegations that her son and superstar daughter were molested as children until the making of the new documentary ""Whitney,"" says the film's executive producer.
Patricia Houston, the sister-in-law of Whitney, is responsible for getting the film, out Friday, to screen. Directed by Kevin Macdonald, ""Whitney"" paints an intimate portrait of the Grammy-winning pop queen and movie star through interviews with her brothers, her mother, friends, and behind-the-scenes footage. Houston's regal image over the decades was eroded by erratic behavior due to her drug use; she died in 2012, on the eve of the Grammys, after being discovered unresponsive in a hotel bathtub. She was 48.
It's the second documentary on Houston: ""Whitney: Can I Be Me"" was released earlier this year.
Patricia Houston, wife of Gary Garland-Houston, said it was difficult making ""Whitney"" because it hit so close to home — and because she was the one who had to tell Cissy Houston not only that there were abuse allegations, but they would be in the film.
""It was deeply a revelation for her. You think about her, and it being a bit overbearing for her to hear — and her kids not telling her. That's pretty tough to have to deal with,"" said Houston.
Dee Dee Warwick, the niece of Cissy Houston and sister to Dionne Warwick, was the alleged abuser. The alleged incidents took place when Gary and Whitney were between the ages of 7 and 9 and Cissy was touring. Warwick, who was 18 years older than Whitney Houston, died in 2008.
The documentary suggests that the sexual abuse endured by the children was a significant contributor to their struggles with drugs as adults.
""I don't think you can explain anyone's life from one particular event that's happened to them. But I think that it's certainly fair to say that it's maybe, in my opinion, the major contributor to Whitney's unhappiness,"" MacDonald said. ""That and the fact that she never talked about it, and that nobody in the family talked about this and clearly it happened as you'd learned in the film.""
MacDonald says the secrets in Houston's life took their toll on the Grammy-winning singer. He cites a clip in the film shot in the mid-2000s that shows her in conflict.
""I think there's an amazing piece of home movie footage in the film, which was from the early 2000s where Whitney is sort of really looking despairing. ... she's talking to herself, really going, 'Nippy calling Whitney. Whitney calling Nippy.' And Nippy was her sort of nickname that everybody close to her knew her as Nippy. And Nippy was the real her, as it were, the intimate her. Whitney was the persona,"" Macdonald said.
""I think what you see in that home movie clip is this confusion that she has. I think it got progressively worse as she got older. The confusion between what's the real me, and what's not the real me. And obviously, the drugs didn't help with that,"" Macdonald said.",www.taiwannews.com.tw,2018-07-05 01:27:00,29,2573

New Delhi: The government was not aware whether bank fraud fugitive Nirav Modi sought political asylum in the UK, official sources said on Wednesday.
A media report had said that Nirav Modi was seeking political asylum in the UK.
“We are not aware that he has asked political asylum in the UK. The UK has not informed us that he has sought political asylum in that country,” said a source.
Nirav Modi is wanted by the CBI in the USD 2 billion Punjab National Bank scam.
The Interpol has already issued a Red Corner Notice against Nirav Modi, his brother Nishal Modi and his employee Subhash Parab on the request of the CBI.
There were reports that Nirav Modi may have visited the UK, France and Belgium in the past few weeks.
The sources said Indian missions abroad are conveying to local governments about the Interpol Red Corner Notice against Nirav Modi.
The Interpol has issued the Red Corner Notice (RCN) on the basis of chargesheet filed by the CBI in a special court in Mumbai and the arrest warrant issued by the special judge JC Jagdale there.
In its Red Corner Notice issued against a fugitive, the Interpol asks its 192 member countries to arrest or detain the person if spotted in their countries after which extradition or deportation proceedings can begin.
Nirav Modi along with his wife Ami Modi, a US citizen, brother Nishal Modi, a Belgian citizen, and uncle Mehul Choksi, all accused in the CBI FIRs in the case, had left the country in the first week of January, weeks before country’s biggest banking scam surfaced.

"AAP supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal (Express File Photo) AAP supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal (Express File Photo)
Representing the AAP government of Delhi in Supreme Court, the legal team headed by Congress leader and senior advocate P Chidambaram had centered its argument on two main premises: that special provisions conferred by the Constitution had “whittled down the executive power of the Centre” to only three reserved subjects of public order, police, and land; and the Constitution conferred a “Westminster-style cabinet system of government” for the capital. This, the Delhi government submitted, effectively makes the L-G bound by the “aid and advice” of the Council of Ministers.
The AAP government’s legal team extensively quoted B R Ambedkar on federalism in Constituent Assembly debates — and argued that Article 239AA, which gives special status to Delhi, is “an example of the hallmark of federalism in our Constitution, which reserves legislative primacy of Parliament in certain limited areas, but there is no such corresponding provision in the Constitution which reserves the executive powers of the Central government vis-a-vis GNCTD (Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi).”
It argued that the Delhi government has “the sole power to take executive actions on all matters on which the Delhi Legislature is competent to pass laws, irrespective of whether or not the Legislature has actually passed a law on the subject”. In support of this argument, it had laid emphasis on the constitutional principle of “collective responsibility to a democratically elected legislative body” — and on that basis, the Delhi government had argued that the L-G was “bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of Delhi”.
Importantly, it argued that under Article 73 of the Constitution, there can be “concurrent legislative powers” between Parliament and state Assemblies. However, the AAP government argued, “there can never be concurrent executive powers” between the Central and a state government – such a situation, it told the court, “would result in chaos in the absence of any accountability for executive actions”.
The legal team stated, “Democracy being one of the facets of the basic structure of the Constitution, the 69th amendment was aimed at furthering democracy in Delhi, and hence Article 239AA should be interpreted in the backdrop of the fact that Delhi has been conferred special status among various UTs and in such a way that democracy in its true sense is established in Delhi.”

"Policemen outside the Burari home on Tuesday (Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav) Policemen outside the Burari home on Tuesday (Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav)
Days after 11 members of a family were found hanging at their home in Burari, the Delhi Police Crime Branch Wednesday said they have recovered CCTV footage from a night before the incident, which shows two of the victims — Savita and her daughter Nidhi — carrying stools inside their home. Soon after, the teenagers, Shivam and Dhruv, can be seen entering their plywood shop on the ground floor to pick up a bundle of telephone wires.
Police sources said the footage was recovered from a camera installed in a neighbouring house. On Sunday morning, the bodies of Narayani Devi (77), her sons Bhuvanesh (50) and Lalit (45), daughters-in-law Savita (48) and Teena (42), daughter Pratibha (57), and grandchildren Priyanka (33), Nidhi (25), Maneka (23), Dhruv (15) and Shivam (15) were found gagged, blindfolded and hanging in the hallway. The family ran a grocery and plywood shop on the ground floor.
CCTV footage from a neighbouring house shows two of the victims, Savita and Nidhi, carrying the stools. CCTV footage from a neighbouring house shows two of the victims, Savita and Nidhi, carrying the stools.
Police sources claimed that while five stools were used by nine of victims, Pratibha, who was found hanging from the window grill, used a smaller one. Police said the stools seen in the footage are similar to the ones found near the bodies.
“The footage also shows that no one entered the house from 10.57 pm on Saturday till the next morning. At 10.39 pm, a delivery boy is seen leaving the house. At 10.57 pm, Bhuvanesh enters the house with the dog,” said a police officer. Police said that as per the footage, a van stopped outside the house at 5.56 am Sunday, and the driver and helper offloaded milk trays and bread before leaving by 6.03 am.
Police said the house has no other entrance apart from the main gate. “But there is another entry to the house from the terrace, which is connected to the next house. We are looking into whether anyone entered the house this way,” added the officer.
While police had initially registered a murder case, the preliminary post-mortem report had stated that the victims died of hanging. Police said they are awaiting the viscera report, which could establish if they were poisoned. A senior police officer said they have recovered at least 11 notebooks from the house. The entries start from September 2007, soon after the death of Devi’s husband the same year. Police said Lalit had told his family members that his father’s soul would enter his body and advise him on steps for a good life.
With police also probing the significance of 11 pipes protruding from the house, the contractor who was hired to renovate the premises said they were meant for ventilation. “The family had asked us to provide ventilation for the house. We made holes on the wall near the stairs to fix the pipes… we never counted the number of pipes; it was a coincidence that there were 11,” said Kunwarpal (68).

"Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal (File Photo) Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal (File Photo)
The Central government’s stand before Supreme Court was that while special status has been conferred on Delhi by the Constitution by creation of a Legislative Assembly, the President will continue to remain its “executive head”, acting through the Lt Governor. Representing the Centre, Additional Solicitor General of India Maninder Singh said the special provisions mentioned “Lieutenant Governor”, and not the “Council of Ministers”, as responsible for the administration of the Union Territory (UT).
Singh argued that since Delhi continues to be a UT, “its governance shall be regulated by provision of Article 239”, which states that all UTs will be governed by the President. The Centre submitted, “…to devolve exclusive legislative or exclusive executive power on the Legislative Assembly or Council of Ministers of the NCT of Delhi would result in elevating a Union Territory to the status of a State, a demand rejected by the Constitution-makers on several instances. That apart, it would be impermissible under any interpretation of the constitutional text, and also contrary to the constitutional mandate.”
On this point, it also referred to Article 53 and 73 and stated that “nowhere in the Constitution, including Articles 239A or 239AA, it has been stipulated that executive power of a Union Territory shall vest in the Council of Ministers/Legislative Assembly”.
The Centre argued that according to provision under the Government of NCTD Act, the Constitution “does not stipulate any automatic conferral of executive power”. It said that the aid and advice rendered by the Council of Ministers is “not binding” upon the L-G, and that “he is empowered to form an opinion that differs from the opinion of the Council of Ministers”. In such a situation, the Centre stated, the proviso to Article 239AA(4) comes into play, which provides that in case of such difference of opinion, the President’s decision will be final.
The Centre also argued that Article 239AA(4) employs the phrase “Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers”, which implies that it is the “Lieutenant Governor” — and not the “Council of Ministers” — who is responsible for Delhi’s administration. A close reading of Article 239 with Article 239AA, along with Section 44 of GNCTD Act, 1991, would reveal that the expression ‘Executive action of the Lt. Governor’ and not the ‘Executive action of NCT of Delhi’ has been stipulated in the said provisions, it had argued.

Carlos Bacca isn’t the surest of penalty takers. The Colombian centre forward misses one in four attempts. But that wasn’t the only reason Jordan Pickford fancied his chances against him. The England goalkeeper was armed with crucial intel: when in pressure, Bacca shoots to his right.
On Tuesday night, in their Round of 16 match in Moscow, Pickford — and England — used this stat in the crudest way possible. When Bacca took his shot, Pickford leaped to his right, parrying the ball away with his outstretched hand. It was the most crucial moment of a dramatic shootout as England, scarred by decades of failure, finally won a tie-breaker.
It should also provide closure to one of football’s favourite cliches — that penalties are predominantly down to luck. This logic might have been true a decade ago, when the use of statistics and technology was at a primitive level. But as teams have shown in the last few years, especially in this World Cup, the sport has become smarter. There is science behind penalties, not just luck.
Every team has at least one analyst whose only job is to study the penalty patterns of their opponents. On Tuesday night, Pickford and David Ospina, the Colombian goalkeeper, guessed the right way almost every time. But most kicks were so well hit that it was practically impossible to save them. Of course, it’s impossible to say what the penalty taker will do at that exact moment. But the data helps goalkeepers take an educated guess, thus giving them a better chance of saving the penalty.
Coincidentally, it was in Moscow that the first actual impact of data science in penalty shootouts at a major tournament was witnessed exactly 10 years, in a match involving English teams. Before the 2008 Champions League final, Chelsea got on board a researcher named Ignacio Palacios Huerta.
Penalty doctor
The Spaniard prepared a dossier on every Manchester United player and one of his findings was particularly striking: Cristiano Ronaldo, he observed, paused during his run-up, waited for the goalkeeper to commit and then slotted the ball to the opposite side. Huerta also pointed out that most of Ronaldo’s kicks were to the goalkeeper’s right. These bits were relayed to Petr Cech, the current Arsenal goalkeeper who who was with Chelsea back then.
The final ended 1-1 after extra time and penalties came into play, Cech — who till then relied simply on instinct — followed Huerta’s advice. When Ronaldo’s turn came, he, as expected, stopped briefly in his run-up. But Cech didn’t move. That unsettled Ronaldo and he ultimately hit a weak shot to the right. Cech leaped in that direction and saved it. The play forced Ronaldo to alter his run-up — he has never repeated the pause again.
In the same match, Huerta also provided Chelsea’s strikers with fascinating insights on Manchester United custodian Edwin van der Sar’s behaviour in shootouts. The Dutchman, he said, had a tendency of diving to his right. So in the tie-breaker, the first six penalty-takers aimed to Van der Sar’s left, with him going to his favoured side each time.
Then, the most remarkable thing happenned. When Nicolas Anelka stepped up to take the decisive kick, Van der Sar pointed to the left, as if saying, ‘I know which way you’re going.’ That sowed doubt in Anelka’s mind. He halted for an extra second after the referee blew his whistle, trying to decide which way to go before choosing to go to the right. Van der Sar jumped in that direction and pulled off a stunning save. A classic example of what Gary Lineker once said, that penalties are ‘war of nerves between the kicker and ’keeper.’
That night, Anelka’s decision to deviate from the plan cost his team a European title. But Huerta’s reputation grew several folds. In the football world, they started calling him the penalty doctor. It wasn’t only because of that one night in Moscow.
Coin toss
In 2003, he came up with a fascinating thesis (Professionals Play Minimax), analysing 1,417 penalty kicks, primarily from the leagues in Spain, England and Italy. It was the kind of research that was never done before, going into the minutest details of each penalty taken — the reaction of players in pressure situations, the placement of penalties and such.
One observation, however, stood out: the team that took the first shot first won 60.5 per cent of the shootouts. That, he concluded, was because of the mental pressure on the team kicking second, of the need to score in order to stay in the game.
Toss, one of the most under-rated aspects before shootouts, hence becomes crucial. In the quarterfinal of the 2008 European Championships, Gianluigi Buffon won the toss and allowed Spain to take the first kick. Italy lost while Spain went on to win the title. In 2016 Champions League final, Atletico Madrid won the toss before the shootout and decided to go after their city rivals Real. They, too, could not cope with the pressure and lost.
That shootout, too, revealed the kind of study that goes into shootouts. Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak, Real noticed, would take a small step towards the side he would jump just before the penalty was taken. It would help him cover the corner faster and more efficiently. So Real’s kickers slowed down their run up, saw Oblak’s first step and placed the ball in the opposite corner.
These weren’t perfectly taken penalties, but it didn’t matter because Oblak had no chance of saving them.
Perfect penalties
An analysis by Opta, one of the leading sports analytics companies, shows that penalties hit to the top corners are the least saved because it is hard for goalkeepers to cover those areas. In the Euro 96 shootouts, where Gareth Southgate infamously missed his kick, 9 out of the 11 penalties were hit in the top corners. The current England coach went low, and his attempt was saved.
Penalties taken along the surface, too, have a high success rate but only when they are aimed at the side netting and hit with a lot of venom — almost half of Cristiano Ronaldo’s 104 accurate penalties are hit here. At this World Cup, 9 out of the 24 penalties in the group stage have been hit to the bottom right corner of the goal. But accuracy is a key issue here — slightly weak, and it’ll be saved — as Bacca’s failed attempt proved on Tuesday.
Research shows that from goalkeepers’ point of view, it might not be a bad gamble for them to stand their ground. In 2010, analysts Florian Baumann, Tim Friehe and Michael Wedow (General Ability and Specialization: Evidence From Penalty Kicks in Soccer) studied 999 penalties in the Bundesliga and concluded that 15 per cent of players shot down the middle. At the same time, a separate study of 286 penalties showed just two per cent goalkeepers remained in the centre. That, they said, is because of action bias — where the goalkeepers feel it is important to be seen as making an effort instead of doing nothing and being blamed.
It is, of course, not always possible for goalkeepers to remember all this in the heat of the moment. So some, like Julian Pollersbeck, take the extreme measure of sneaking in cheat sheets on the field. The German goalkeeper was spotted checking the tiny sheet of paper, hidden in his left sock, containing penalty instructions during the European U-21 championship semifinal against England. He pulled off two brilliant saves, condemning England to yet another shootout defeat.
On Tuesday, Pickford ended England’s tie-breaker hoodoo. There was a lot of skill involved in pulling off the save. But there was also science behind it.
AbaB to ABBA?
A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B-A-B
This is the traditional format, being used in this World Cup. Each team has five kicks and takes it in turn. The team with the most goals at the end of the five kicks each wins the game. In case there’s a tie, it goes to sudden death. However, research has proven that the team taking the first penalty has a winning percent of 60.5, giving the team that wins the toss an advantage.
A-B-B-A-A-B-B-A-A-B
The International Football Association Board (IFAB), which formulates the game’s rules, has experimented an alternate system, similar to tie-breaks in tennis. As per that, Team A takes the first penalty, Team B the second and third, Team A the fourth and fifth and so on until each team had taken five. The sequence would continue if the shootout then goes to sudden death.
Aiming High
Penalties targeted at the top corners are least saved because it is hard for the goalkeepers to cover those areas. Out of the 434 penalties taken in 44 World Cup and European Championship games, just 3 percent of the shots hit halfway up the goal or more are saved, according to statistics group Opta. At this World Cup, none of the penalties aimed at the top corners have been saved — three failed shots have missed the target.
Favoured Spot
Penalty kicks taken along the surface have high success rate, but mostly when they are aimed at the side netting and hit with a lot of venom. Cristiano Ronaldo is among the finest exponents of this – half of the 104 accurate penalties he’s taken in his career are aimed here. Usually, right-footed players aim at this corner since it is their natural side.
Middle path
Shots taken down the middle have high conversion ratio. Analysts studied 999 penalties in Bundesliga and concluded that 15 percent of players targetted centre. Another research found out just 2 percent of the keepers remained in the centre. Since they dive either left or right, the goalies have been able to save only those shots which have been low, getting lucky with their trailing leg.
Accuracy an issue
The number of penalties aimed to the left of the goalkeeper are fewer because this is a natural side for the left-footed players, who are in the minority. The only concern with penalties aimed at the bottom — left or right — is the accuracy; slightly weak or misdirected, and it’ll land in no man’s land, resulting in a save, as was the case with Colombia’s Bacca on Tuesday.
High risk
The shots aimed at the top corners also require a high degree of technical skills. These attempts are risky as it is easy to hit them off target. Overall, in the World Cups and European Championships, 18 percent of high shots have missed the target. In Russia, too, it has happened thrice, most recently during the shootout between England and Colombia,
when Mateus Uribe’s shot struck the crossbar.

"MOSCOW: Veteran Belgium defender Vincent Kompany said on Wednesday (Jul 4) Brazil are the best team at the World Cup but his side are not losing any sleep at the prospect of playing them.
The most talented Belgium team for decades face the ultimate test on Friday when they take on the five-time winners in Kazan for a place in the semi-finals.

""Individually, Brazil are the strongest team in this World Cup,"" Kompany, who made the last of his international appearances as a substitute in the 1-0 win over England, told reporters.
""That is a compliment but it doesn't affect our chances against them. None of us are going to sleep at night thinking 'We have already lost to Brazil'.
""Defensively they are solid, they win all their defensive duels and in attack, they are not scared to take people on one-on-one.
""They always have a key to unlock any situation.""

Manchester City stalwart Kompany, 32, said although Belgium boast their own outstanding individual players such as Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne, the only way they will beat Brazil is to play as a team.
""We are going to look them in the eye. But if we make this a match of individuals, then we'll lose,"" he said.
Belgium, who came from behind to beat Japan in a thrilling last-16 match, have fast become the favourite team of many fans of countries already eliminated for their attractive style of flowing football, a role their old rivals the Netherlands often occupied.
""We have developed an attractive style of football, we have scored a lot of goals and showed our good side,"" said Kompany.
""If we play well against Brazil, we can attract even more supporters. Neutral fans appreciate good football, like the Netherlands used to play.
""We're constantly improving. We just have to step up to another level against Brazil. At least I hope we can.""
Belgium will have to find a way to stop Neymar, whose performances in Russia have attracted as much criticism as praise, for his alleged over-reaction to fouls.
Asked by a Brazilian journalist what he would do if Neymar fell theatrically in front of him, Kompany turned the question back on his questioner.
""What would you say to him? You are a Brazilian journalist? Ah, I see you're too scared to reply. I don't care (what Neymar does). If it becomes a match of individual performances we've got no chance.

"Arvind Kejriwal at the Delhi Secretariat on Wednesday. (Source: Twitter) Arvind Kejriwal at the Delhi Secretariat on Wednesday. (Source: Twitter)
The Supreme Court verdict on Wednesday did not explicitly delve into the last legal flashpoint between the AAP government in Delhi and the BJP-led Central government over matters pertaining to “services”, which involves creation of posts. The court made it clear that the Delhi Cabinet is empowered with those subjects for which the Assembly has legislative power.
The order effectively gives the upper hand to the AAP government on the subject of services. The court made it clear that the executive power of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) is “co-extensive” with the legislative power of the Delhi Assembly, which is envisaged in the Constitution and which “extends over all but three subjects in state list and all subjects in the concurrent list.”
The observation effectively means that executive power of the Delhi government is coterminous with legislative power of the Delhi Assembly, which extends over all subjects in the state list and concurrent list barring the three reserved subjects. It also means that provisions of Constitution empowers executive power on the Council of Ministers over all subjects for which the Delhi Assembly has legislative power.
More importantly, the Supreme Court has made it clear that the provisions of Constitution “reserves the Parliament’s legislative power on all matters in the state list and concurrent list, but nowhere reserves the executive powers of the Union with respect to such matters”.
The observation by the Constitution bench effectively means that while Parliament exclusively has the legislative power on all matter in state and concurrent lists, the same is not extended to the Central government.
In April, the General Administration Department of GNCTD had cancelled the order of appointment of nine advisers to ministries, citing an order by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. The GAD had said that a May 21, 2015 notification of the MHA “clarifies that ‘services’ under GNCTD, which included creation of services/posts, is (a) subject reserved for central government as per the Constitution.”
The Delhi High Court had earlier upheld the MHA order. The High Court order practically dis-empowered Delhi government on issues of appointments even in subject matters duly within the remit of the state government. The AAP government has been crying foul, suggesting that the verdict had a chilling affect on its powers since it granted an upper hand to the L-G in the state bureaucracy.
The court made it clear that the executive power of the Central government over the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi is “confined to three matters”: public order, police and land.
Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra has said, “A conjoint reading of Article 239AA (3) (a) and Article 239AA(4) reveals that the executive power of the Government of NCT of Delhi is co­extensive with the legislative power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly which is envisaged in Article 239AA(3) and which extends over all but three subjects in the State List and all subjects in the Concurrent List and, thus, Article 239AA(4) confers executive power on the Council of Ministers over all those subjects for which the Delhi Legislative Assembly has legislative power.”

"BANYULS-SUR-MER, France: French wine lovers have risen up in revolt after a Japanese couple who make ""outstanding"" wine in southern France were threatened with deportation.
More than 42,000 have already signed a petition protesting the ""crazy, moronic and shameful decision"", with wine and restaurant critics now joining the outcry.

Rie and Hirofumi Shoji's ""exceptional"" red wine, Pedres Blanques (White Rocks), made from grenache grapes near Banyuls-sur-Mer in the French Catalan region of Roussillon, became an instant hit after their first harvest last year.
It has already made the cellars of the world's best restaurant, Can Roca, just across the Spanish border in Girona, and top Paris restaurants have also been vying to stock up on the natural wine.
Their first year of production completely sold out, with 10,000 bottles quickly snapped up and the price surging from €12 (US$14) to €26.
But immigration officials said the couple could not stay in France because they were not earning enough and their business was ""not viable"".

The Shojis sunk €100,000 of their savings and took out a €50,000 loan to buy their vineyards on difficult terrain where the Pyrenees mountains plunge into the Mediterranean.
They harvest the grapes by hand, growing them organically and without adding anything to the wine.
Hirofumi Shoji, 38, fell in love with French wine when he began working for the French three-star Michelin chef Alain Ducasse in Japan.
The Shojis met in France after arriving separately in 2011 dreaming of making their own wine. Both studied and worked with some of the country's leading winemakers in the Burgundy and Bordeaux regions to perfect their skills before marrying and buying the land together in 2016.
'EXTRAORDINARY WINE'
But when they tried to change their status on their papers from ""employees"" to ""farmers"" officials told them they would have to leave the country because they earned less than €2,000 a month.
Their lawyer Jean Codognes told AFP that at first he thought it was ""an administrative mistake but then three days ago the prefecture confirmed its order.""
""Their wine has been a huge success and 75 per cent of the production for this year has already been reserved,"" he added.
He said the couple had not had a centime of state aid to set up their business because they did not qualify as foreigners.
Renowned local winemaker Alain Castex also came to their defence, praising Pedres Blanques as ""an extraordinary wine"".
""They are really passionate people with very high ethical standards and they have been a magnificent success,"" he told French public television.
Jean L'Heritier, the organiser of a wine fair in Perpignan, the capital the Roussillon region, said it would be a ""huge loss for everyone if the Shojis had to leave. The quality of their grapes, and the typically Japanese perfectionism of their winemaking"" had impressed their peers, he told the local newspapers, L'Independant.
Callers to local radio stations raged at the officials as ""moronic"", and Twitter users also described the decision as ""criminal"". Green MEP Yannick Jadot called the decision ""absurd"" and urged his supporters to sign the petition to save the Shojis.
Banyuls is best known for its rich red dessert wines, often called the wine world's best-kept secret.
Codognes, who has appealed the decision, said the couple were doing well compared to many other winemakers locally. ""The average revenue in the area (from winemaking) even with subsidies is less than €1,000 a month,"" he added.
Several Japanese winemakers have made a name for themselves in France in recent years, almost all making organic and natural wines, led by Hirotake Ooka, whose Domaine de Grande Colline wines have a cult following in his homeland.",www.channelnewsasia.com,2018-07-05 01:10:00,25,205122
"BRASILIA: Shares in the Brazil aircraft manufacturer Embraer soared on Wednesday (Jul 4) on the back of speculation that a deal to create a new company with US plane-maker Boeing was in the offing.
Embraer stock was up 4.77 per cent at midday on Wednesday on the Sao Paulo stock exchange after peaking at a six per cent rise earlier in the day.

On Tuesday, shares in the flagship company of Brazilian industry had already closed up 5.1 per cent.
The daily Folha de S. Paulo said on Wednesday the government had agreed in principle on the proposed tie-up - which media reports say would leave Boeing as the majority partner in a new company - but had yet to make an official announcement.
It said an official deal would be announced in the coming days.
According to the economic daily Valor earlier this week, Embraer would keep sole control of its military activities under the agreement and would merge its civilian aircraft building with the US giant.

Embraer, the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, was founded as a state group in 1969 before being privatized in 1994, although the Brazilian government retained the right to make strategic decisions for the company.
Folha said the two manufacturers would create a third company, in which Boeing would have an 80 per cent controlling stake and Embraer 20 per cent.
Embraer, with a US$6 billion turnover and 16,000 employees, confirmed to AFP on Monday they were in ""advanced negotiations"" with Boeing.
Taking charge of Embraer's civilian airliner business would allow Boeing to compete more effectively in the medium-range aircraft market with Airbus, which last October formed a strategic partnership with Canadian manufacturer Bombardier.",www.channelnewsasia.com,2018-07-05 01:10:00,10,206852

BJP chief Amit Shah on Wednesday termed the Centre’s decision to increase the minimum support price (MSP) for kharif crops as “historic”, and thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for it. “This is a historic decision. No previous government had the courage to implement a 50 per cent rise in the MSP for crops. Since Independence, thousands of farmers have been agitating and many also sacrificed their lives for an increase in prices of farm produce. So we and the farmers of the country thank PM Modi ji for this historic decision,” said Shah during a press conference in Mirzapur.
Shah landed in Mirzapur on Wednesday afternoon accompanied by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as part of his two-day visit to the state ahead of the crucial 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP chief held a closed-door meeting here with party leaders and workers from in and around Lucknow, Gorakhpur and Varanasi. The meeting was attended by Adityanath, Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma, BJP’s national general secretary Bhupendra Nath and state unit president Mahendra Nath Pandey.
“BJP is the only cadre-based party in the country which holds meetings to democratically discuss problems of people it works for. Today’s meeting was one such meeting,” Sharma told reporters after the meeting. Shah also met ally Apna Dal leader and Mirzapur MP Anupriya Patel. She later told the media, “Amit Shah met workers and spent a long time with them and it is clear they are happy about this.”
Later, Shah left for Varanasi where he interacted with members of the BJP’s IT cell. Shah, who was the chief guest at the BJP’s ‘Social media volunteers meet of Eastern UP’, termed the BJP’s social media volunteers as “cyber warriors” and asked them to spread like fire from Jammu and Kashmir to Kanyakumari to ensure the party’s victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He said the volunteers need to use their creative minds to defeat opponents and give a befitting reply to those spreading lies against the party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Shah also praised Adityanath, saying law and order had improved in Uttar Pradesh and criminals had gone into hiding in neighbouring Delhi, where the situation had deteriorated. On Thursday, Shah will leave for Agra, where he will meet party leaders from Kanpur, Bundelkhand, Braj and western Uttar Pradesh.

"STOCKHOLM: A Swedish court has ordered a bankrupt Arabic internet TV company to pay 210 million Swedish crowns (US$24 million) in damages for distributing content including English Premier League soccer without permission.
The Stockholm district court ordered the Sweden-based Advanced TV Network (ATN), which distributes Arabic-language content over the internet, to pay 194.8 million crowns in damages to Qatar’s beIN Sports and 14.6 million crowns to Albanian TV group DigitAlb.

""It is, according to the court's opinion, shown beyond reasonable doubt that ATN at no time ... had the rights to broadcast the beIN channels in question,"" the court said in a verdict dated June 29 and seen by Reuters.
The Stockholm court also sentenced ATN owner Hamid al-Hamid, 58, to two and a half years in prison, while his son Ahmed and another business associate were sentenced to one year each. All three were found guilty of charges including misuse of decoding information and copyright violations.
Hamid al-Hamid's lawyer Johan Nilsson told Reuters that he was working with Ahmed al-Hamid's lawyer and that they planned to appeal the verdict in its entirety.
ATN declared bankruptcy in September 2016, according to the court document. It argued in court that it had distributed the content with the necessary agreements from the content owners, according to the document.

One of the prosecutors in the case, Anneli Tirud Wallin, told Reuters it was her understanding that damages could be extracted from assets belonging ATN or its owners.

Nordic Content Protection, an anti-piracy industry group for Nordic broadcasters which originally filed the case against ATN in 2016, welcomed what it said was a landmark ruling.
""The prison sentences and record fines handed down in this case send a clear message to broadcast pirates,"" the group's chief executive Anders Braf said in a statement.

""The fact that the game against Brazil is defining for our generation is for sure, though. It's not like we've been failing up to now but there is a level above, which we need to achieve, which can be done by a game like the one we are playing against Brazil.
""So, it's a defining game, but not just for us, it's a defining game for Brazil as well. The players that they have … both teams deserve to be facing each other a little further in, in this tournament and not in the quarter-final.""
For years, much has been expected of a crop of players, which Kompany previously captained, including Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard, Thibault Courtois and Dries Mertens but Belgium have so far not delivered on their promise, going out in the quarter-finals of the 2014 World Cup and at the European Championships in France two years ago.
But Kompany said they were mentally tougher, mostly because squad members had been winning at club level around Europe.

""It used to be in Belgian culture, and I think everyone would agree with me, we would feel defeated even before a game like this but all these players in our team, who play at clubs around the world, now believe 100 percent we can beat Brazil. Whether that's realistic I don't know, Brazil are an incredible team but there is not one day I go to bed thinking 'what if we lose'?""
Asked what he would do if Neymar repeated his much-criticised theatrics from Monday's Round of 16 win over Mexico, where he rolled around in apparent agony on the field after clashes with the opposition, Kompany said: ""I don't know. I don't care. If it's going to be a game of individual performances and just that, then let me tell you right now we have no chance against Brazil.
""But if it's going to be a collective performance from a smart team that knows how to play together and fight for each other, then we have a chance and that's the only thing I care about.
""Whatever any player on the other team does will not matter much,"" added polyglot Kompany, who answered questions in four different languages during his half-hour press conference.

The busiest corridor for international migration is from India to the US, accounting for four times as many migrants as the next busiest, which is from the Philippines to Canada. A newly released World Bank report on global migration shows nearly 12 lakh skilled migrants from India to the US in 2010, compared to nearly 3 lakh from the Philippines to Canada. These figures are based on a definition of skilled migrants as those who have had complete or partial tertiary education. Skilled migrants account for 70-80% of all migrants in each of the 10 busiest corridors, and either the US or Canada is the destination in nine of these 10 corridors.
“Three countries, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, are the destinations in all of these top corridors,” the report says. The report notes a rapid change in the skill composition of migrant stocks since 1990. In 1990, out of about 40 million migrants living in the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, almost half were primary-educated while 27% were tertiary-educated. In 2000, out of 60 million migrants, tertiary-educated migrants had reached almost 20 million, or one-third of the total.
By 2010, the migrant stock was over 85 million, and the number of tertiary-educated was about half (43 million). What has led to the increased share of skilled migrants?
Among the reasons identified in the report, “First, high-skilled migrants can more easily afford the financial costs of migration, earn higher absolute wage gains, and face lower migration policy barriers. Second, the supply of high-skilled migrants has increased rapidly as overall education levels in the world rose quickly during these two decades.”

Tip for Reading List: Obama Official’s Memoir of Hope
Dan Pfeiffer, who served as senior advisor to former US President Barack Obama, decided to write his first book only after Donald Trump won the presidential election. “It wasn’t until Trump won that I thought back to all the things that I dealt with in the White House and that President Obama dealt with — the political forces, the changes in media and technology, the radicalization of the right,” Pfeiffer said in an interview to National Public Radio.
Yes We (Still) Can: Politics in the Age of Obama, Twitter, and Trump is both a look back and a hopeful look forward, as described by Kirkus Reviews. The author reflects not only on his White House experience of working with Obama, but also on an election that the Democrats could have won, but did not. Part-memoir and part-guidebook, it suggests how to create successful campaigns using “five building blocks — attitude, scaling, culture, strategy, and branding”. Pfeiffer has a tip for the Democrats for 2020, writing that they need to be “audacious, authentic and inspirational”.
This Word Means: Deer in the headlights
When a deer is caught in the headlights of a vehicle at night, it invariably freezes. This fact is well known to motorists who have encountered deer on highways, and has given rise to the idiom “like a deer in the headlights”. This describes anyone who is a state of paralysed surprise, fear or bewilderment.
On Tuesday, Delhi High Court used the idiom during a hearing in relation to a sting by Cobrapost, when it observed that “when a public official is caught in a sting, he looks like a deer caught in the headlights of a vehicle.”
What makes deer freeze in the headlights? The answer lies in biology. Deer are crepuscular animals, which means they are active during twilight, and their vision is optimised for very low light. When a headlight beam strikes eyes that are fully dilated to capture as much light as possible, deer cannot see at all, and they freeze until the eyes can adjust, The New York Times explains in a 2010 article quoting deer biologist David C Yancy.
The article also cites research that deer are “legally blind” by human standards. It quotes a researcher as estimating a deer’s vision at 20/200 — where a person with normal eyesight can discern an object’s details at 200 yards, deer need to be within 20 yards.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany and France have offered Spain ""observer status"" on a programme to develop a new European fighter jet, but want to keep the project as a binational endeavour for now to ensure it moves ahead quickly, according to a German government source.
The new programme, first announced by the French and German governments a year ago, has begun to take shape in recent months, with France set to take the lead on the development of the next-generation combat jet.
Spain had sent a letter to its NATO allies asking to participate in the critical industrial undertaking in December, according to the government source and several industry sources.
The German and French defence ministries then responded in April, offering Madrid the opportunity to observe the fledgling programme as it took shape, but without the ability to shape its initial parameters. No reply had yet been received from Spain, the government source said.
""The reason is not to exclude anyone but to ensure accelerated work on the programme,"" said the source, who was not authorised to speak publicly.
Spain and other countries would likely be able to participate in later stages of the programme, the source said, a view embraced by the companies involved.
The Spanish Defence Ministry confirmed it received the letter and said it was currently assessing the offer. Spain holds a 4 percent stake in European planemaker Airbus, while France and Germany each hold a stake of 11 percent.
The new warplane is intended to replace from 2040 the Rafale fighter built by France's Dassault Aviation and the Eurofighter Typhoon, built by a European consortium comprised of Airbus, Britain's BAE Systems and Italy's Leonardo.
It is expected to be at the centre of a broader weapons system, capable of commanding a squadron of drones.
Dassault and Airbus signed an agreement in April to work together on the new project, but avoided saying which of the two groups would be in charge. The fact that France is now in the driving seat of the project favours Dassault to take charge since most of Airbus' defence activities are in Germany.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to jointly develop the new aircraft shortly after his election in May 2017, burying past rivalries in favour of tighter defence cooperation.

"Home Ministry announced that a “historic agreement” had been signed among the governments of Mizoram and Tripura and the Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Forum. Home Ministry announced that a “historic agreement” had been signed among the governments of Mizoram and Tripura and the Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Forum.
On Tuesday, when the Home Ministry announced that a “historic agreement” had been signed among the governments of Mizoram and Tripura and the Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Forum, it brought to an end a 21-year wait for over 32,000 Bru tribals, who had been displaced from Mizoram and were living in Tripura. Although the Brus have been seeking relief on the lines of that given to Kashmiri Pandits and Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, their story is not as well known:
The tribe
Bru (or Reang) tribals inhabit parts of some Northeastern states. In Mizoram, they are largely restricted to Mamit and Kolasib districts.
Conflict, displacement
In 1995, following a clash between Mizos and Brus, the Young Mizo Association and Mizo Students’ Association demanded that Brus be removed from the state’s electoral rolls, contending that the tribe was not indigenous to Mizoram. This led to an armed movement led by the militant outfit Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF), and a political one by the Bru National Union (BNU).
READ | After two decades, 32,000 Bru refugees to be repatriated to Mizoram: MHA
On October 21, 1997, BNLF militants killed a forest official in Mizoram, leading to retaliatory ethnic violence. The BNU, which was demanding an autonomous tribal district, claimed that 1,391 Bru houses in 41 villages were burnt down and several people were raped and killed. Mizoram police put the number of homes torched at 325 in 16 villages, and did not confirm rape or murder.
A large number of Bru families fled to North Tripura. Thousands of families, with some 30,000 members, were given shelter in six relief camps in Kanchanpur and Panisagar subdivisions.
Resettlement
The first phase of repatriation started in November 2010, when 1,622 Bru families with 8,573 members were resettled in Mizoram. The process was stalled in 2011, 2012 and 2015 amid protests by Mizo NGOs. Brus settled in Tripura also expressed fears for their security in Mizoram. Since 1997, the Centre has given financial assistance of Rs 348.97 crore to Tripura for relief and rehabilitation, and Rs 68.90 crore to Mizoram for the resettlement of 8,573 persons.
The latest peace deal was brokered over three years, starting in 2015. It involved a joint monitoring committee with members of civil society groups including Young Mizo Association and Mizo Students’ Association, and representatives of the state governments and the Home Ministry.
The package
A financial package of Rs 435 crore was agreed on. It covers 5,407 Bru families (32,876 members). Each family will be given a one-time assistance of Rs 4 lakh — to be kept in fixed deposit within one month of repatriation — and cash assistance of Rs 5,000 per month through direct benefits transfer, as well as free rations for two years. Rs 1.5 lakh will be provided as house building assistance, in three instalments.
For security, the Centre has asked the Mizoram government to create police posts and border outposts. The Home Ministry will sanction funds for setting up the checkposts. The Tripura government will ensure that Aadhaar cards are issued, bank accounts opened and ration cards updated for each Bru migrant before September 30, 2018.
The package includes a special development project, Eklavya residential schools, access to jhum cultivation land, permanent residential certificates and ST certificates, and free transportation from Tripura to Mizoram.
The displaced families had demanded land at one location, which Mizoram rejected. An agreement was reached that they will be relocated to the villages from where they had been displaced.
They will vote
The development comes ahead of elections in Mizoram, the only non-BJP-ruled state in the Northeast. It also means Mizoram’s electoral rolls will have to updated. “The verification of Bru migrants by the government of Mizoram was done on the basis of electoral rolls of 1996, last updated in 2014. In the past, 8,573 Bru migrants were identified and repatriated in six batches,” Home Ministry joint secretary (Northeast) Satyendra Garg said.

New Delhi: Fifteen-year-old Shivam and Dhruv, members of the Chundawat family who were found dead under mysterious circumstances on Sunday, were bright students and had keen interest in music, teachers at their school say.
The teenagers' elder sister, Meenu, who also dies, was registered as Maneka in school records, was an alumnus of the Virendra Public School (VPS) in north Delhi's Timarpur and was a school topper.
A representative of the school said they were also contacted by the investigators in connection with their probe in the case.
Class 9 students Shivam, registered as Dushyant and Dhruv (or Dhirendra) were ""all-rounders"".
""They were studying here right since their childhood and were doing well in their studies. They were also into co-curricular activities. Their elder sister Maneka also passed out from our institution and was a school-topper. None of the teachers had ever had any complaints about their behaviour,"" he said.
A language teacher, who taught Maneka, Dushyant and Dhirendra, said that all of them were in ""shock"" after hearing about the incident.
""I have taught these children and knew them well. Both of them were very intelligent. They were good in music. In fact, I have even taught their elder sister who was quite a studious girl and used to get good grades,"" she recalled.
Teachers also said the parents of the two boys were regular at the parents-teachers' meeting and used to take keen interest in their children's performance in class.
""I was shocked to hear about their deaths. The parents of the children were well-qualified and used to always attend parents-teachers' meetings,"" she added.
Teachers and students observed a five-minute silence on July 2, the day the school reopened after the summer vacations.
Students who used to commute with them in the same school bus from Burari to Timarpur said the brothers never fought with anyone.
""Dushyant and Dhirendra were quite obedient and I never saw them pick up a fight with anyone in the bus. They would not even fight with each other. Their parents used to always pick them up and drop them at the bus stop,"" said a Class 12 student, who stays in Burari.
Ten of the 11 members of the Chundawat family were found hanging from an iron-mesh in the ceiling on July 1, while the body of 77-year-old Narayan Devi, the head of the family, was lying on the floor in another room of the house.

"Bonus of gov’t men subject to tax – SC
1 SHARES Share Tweet
By Rey G. Panaligan
From now on, benefits received by government employees such as allowances, bonuses, and compensation for services are subject to withholding tax, the Supreme Court has ruled.
In a unanimous full court decision released yesterday, the SC said “all income received by an employee from his or her employer are presumptively taxable and subject to withholding and the government, as an employer, has the duty to withhold and remit the proper taxes due thereon.”
The SC also ruled that its decision should “be applied prospectively” and “an employee who claims exemption from withholding taxes has the burden to prove the factual and legal bases of the claim in the proper administrative and judicial proceedings.”
At the same time, the SC said, “The fiscal autonomy enjoyed by the Judiciary, Ombudsman, and Constitutional Commissions does not grant immunity or exemption from the common burden of paying taxes imposed by law.”
With the ruling, the SC affirmed the validity of the regulations issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue which imposed withholding tax on the erstwhile non-taxable fringe benefits of government employees.
The SC Public Information Office said the SC affirmed the validity of Sections 3, 4, and 7 of BIR Revenue Memorandum Order No. 23-2014 which classified income allowances, bonuses, compensation for services granted to government employees and other benefits, except for the 13th month pay, in excess of P30,000, and the loyalty pay as taxable compensation.
Under RMO 23-2014 which took effect on July 7, 2014, all fringe benefits received by employees and officers of government are subject to 30 to 32 percent tax.
“In upholding Sections III and IV, the Court ruled that no additional tax is imposed as the two sections merely mirror the relevant provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 on withholding tax on compensation income,” the PIO said in a briefer.
But the SC declared Section 6 of RMO 23-2014 “only where it names the Governor, City Mayor, Municipal Mayor, Barangay Captain, and Heads of Office in government agencies, government-owned or controlled corporations, and other government offices, as persons required to withhold and remit withholding taxes as null and void.”

"THE hard work is done and the fight back is complete.
Now the mental challenge begins for Toowoomba discus thrower Conor McLoughlin as he steels himself to take on the best at next week's IAAF World Under 20 Championships.
The 2018 six-day event will be held in Tempere, Finland from next Tuesday.
McLoughlin begins competition on Saturday week when two qualifying groups of male 1.75kg discus throwers meet for a place in the July 15 final.
McLoughlin and the Aussie squad are now in Finland preparing for the championships after leaving Australia last week.
The 19-year-old's inclusion in the team alongside fellow discus contender Alexander Kolesnikoff follows months of hard work and dedication to beat an untimely hand injury.
McLoughlin broke his right hand in a home farm incident in April but somehow found a way to overcome the setback in time to cement his team position.
He followed his 57.5m qualifying throw at the March national championships with a pre-departure throw of 54.1cm.
McLoughlin's Toowoomba coach Grahame Pitt said the thrower's resolve to overcome the odds for a team place is reward for dedication.
Pitt is now hoping McLoughlin can capitalise with an appearance in Sunday week's championship final.
""He's in camp now with the Australian squad,” Pitt said.
""It's something like 36 hours flying time to get there so rest and acclimatisation are the first priority.
""He's now readying himself for competition.
""He was throwing really well before he left.
""It's an absolute credit to his dedication that he was able to get back to where he was after not being able to use his injured right hand for so long.
""We worked on a lot of left arm throws and upper body strength on his left side which helped maintain his right side strength.
""Technically he's very strong.
""He's worked hard and is throwing better than ever including metre and metre-and-a-half personal bests in training.
""But it's a whole new ball game next week.
""You rarely see personal best throws at this level of competition; firstly because of the stress of competition and secondly because they are throwing in a stadium with little wind influence.
""I'll be thrilled if he can make it through now to the final eight - that realistically is Conor's goal
""There are two qualifying pools to start with which finds the leading 12 throwers before that is cut to eight for the final.
""Conor has done all the hard work and preparation possible.

"Congress president Rahul Gandhi meets party workers at Amausi airport in Lucknow on Wednesday. Vishal Srivastav Congress president Rahul Gandhi meets party workers at Amausi airport in Lucknow on Wednesday. Vishal Srivastav
Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said that while his party sees people as “Hindustani”, the RSS sees them through their caste and religion.
Speaking to party workers at Fursatganj on the first day of his two-day visit to his parliamentary constituency Amethi, Rahul said: “When you see a person of this country… Hindu, Muslim, or of any caste or religion… You have a feeling of love… as you say that the person is Hindustani. This is the difference between you and RSS. (But) when a person from RSS sees anyone, they say he is a Hindu, he is a Muslim, Sikh, woman or a Dalit… We work to connect (with) people… we spread love and brotherhood… but they work to divide the country, spread hatred and anger.”
Rahul further said that the strength of Congress workers is their love for people and it is this ideology, “which would corner the BJP and RSS”. Targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rahul said that farmers did not get loan waiver, but the prime minister waived loans of selected wealthy industrialists. Rahul also said that despite an issue like Doklam on the border, the prime minister was seen sitting on a swing with the Chinese president.
Hitting out at the Centre, Rahul said that its much talked about bullet train project was like a “magic” locomotive that may not materialise. “It would be built only when the Congress government is formed,” he said. Rahul claimed that the Centre’s demonetisation decision had done nothing but derail business activity at all levels. He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has broken the “backbone” of small traders while benefitting big businessmen. “As much as Rs 2 lakh crore of 15 big businessmen have been waived off…The first task that Narendra Modiji did was that he broke the backbone of small and middle class businessmen,” he said. “He (Modi) snatched money from your pockets through GST and demonetisation and gave it away to Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi,” he added.
Rahul also launched ‘Shakti Programme’, a mobile app that would help workers to directly connect with the party leadership.
Later, Rahul went to Pure Dhingai village to visit the family of a farmer, Abdul Sattar, who had died on May 5 while waiting for his turn to sell his grains at a government-run mandi in Amethi. On Thursday, the Congress chief is scheduled to hold chaupal with farmers and visit villages before leaving for New Delhi in the afternoon.

"Mathur’s absence has been noticed at several meetings, including multiple events involving Shah, CM Yogi Adityanath or NDA allies, in recent months. Mathur’s absence has been noticed at several meetings, including multiple events involving Shah, CM Yogi Adityanath or NDA allies, in recent months.
Almost consistently missing at most key meetings and events of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh over the last several months, BJP national vice-president in-charge for Uttar Pradesh, Om Prakash Mathur, was not in Varanasi when party president Amit Shah went to the Prime Minister’s Lok Sabha constituency on Wednesday.
Shah is on a two-day tour of the state with an aim to streamline the party organisation for preparations ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. Ostensibly upset with party affairs in the state, and working style of BJP state unit general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal, Mathur has skipped key party events in the state for nearly 9 months now. His absence has been noticed at several meetings, including multiple events involving Shah, CM Yogi Adityanath or NDA allies, in recent months.
On his visit to Varanasi and Mirzapur on Wednesday —- to address a meeting of BJP social media volunteers, as also meet leaders from the regions of Gorakhpur, Kashi and Awadh —- Shah was accompanied by BJP national general secretaries Bhupender Yadav and Arun Singh. Sources said Mathur was in Rajasthan today on some party-related events.
Incidentally, all meetings Mathur skipped were attended by Bansal, Adityanath and BJP’s state unit president Mahendra Nath Pandey. Neither Mathur nor Bansal was available for a comment. Dismissing reports that Mathur was upset with party affairs, BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi told The Indian Express, “It is true that Mathur-ji’s movement in UP has decreased over the last few months but that is because he is busy with responsibilities in different states. Mathur-ji is known as an election strategist…under his guidance BJP won UP elections. He was earlier busy with other tasks, but UP BJP regularly gets his guidance on important issues.”
Sources said the last major party event Mathur attended in UP was the state executive meeting in Kanpur in October 2017. He visited Varanasi in February this year for a coordination meeting of the RSS and its offshoots. Sources said Mathur is upset with alleged lobbies in the party organisation in the state. “Lobbying has increased after the party came to power in UP,” a BJP leader said. “Some leaders are taking unilateral decisions without consulting the state in-charge (Mathur).”
According to this leader, Mathur had not taken part in discussions on selection of candidates for Rajya Sabha and Legislative Council elections in UP and Lok Sabha by-polls of Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana in the state. BJP had lost all three Lok Sabha by-polls in the state.
Sources said Mathur has expressed unwillingness in continuing as the party’s in-charge for the electorally crucial state. The party leadership, however, has not made any fresh appointment so far even as meetings and programmes have begun in UP with eye on the General Election.
Seen as a confidant of PM Narendra Modi, Mathur was BJP’s Gujarat in-charge during Modi’s tenure as CM. A former RSS pracharak, Mathur was subsequently deployed as election in-charge in Maharashtra, where the BJP recorded victory. He was given charge of UP in October 2014.
Some key events OP Mathur skipped in UP this year:

"German chancellor Angela Merkel. (File) German chancellor Angela Merkel. (File)
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has reached a deal with a coalition partner in an effort to end a row over immigration that had threatened to break her four-month-old coalition government. A look at the deal and its implications:
What is this latest row about?
It started with pressure mounted by Merkel’s interior minister Horst Seehofer, the leader of the conservative Christian Social Union and a partner in the ruling coalition along with Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union. Seehofer demanded that Merkel close Germany’s border to “secondary migrants” — those who enter the European Union, say into Italy or Greece, and then travel across the EU’s open borders into Germany. Seehofer threatened to resign if Merkel failed to check these migrants, a stand that had the potential to collapse the ruling coalition and end Merkel’s 13-year reign.
Has Merkel averted the crisis?
Yes, to an extent. On Monday, she announced a compromise deal as part of which she agreed to tighten controls along Germany’s border with Austria. Under Germany’s existing open-door policy, all asylum seekers are allowed to enter the country “while they wait for their cases to be reviewed”, but that could now change. Under the deal, Germany will set up camps along the Austrian border to house secondary migrants while their status is reviewed. Any migrant who has already applied for asylum in a different European Union country (Italy, Greece, Spain) will be deported to that country.
But the deal depends on whether the third member of Merkel’s governing coalition, the centre-left Social Democratic Party, clears it. The party has previously criticised plans for “mass-internment camps”. If the SDP rejects the deal, Merkel may have to come up with an entirely different compromise option. If she fails to do so, it could even bring down the government.
Why is this significant?
There are concerns that Merkel’s compromise formula could have a cascading effect, with other European Union countries rethinking the bloc’s control-free travel policy. Italy’s new government is already considered at risk of leaving the EU altogether. Austria has said it would tighten its southern borders if Germany went ahead with the plan. That could trigger more border checks across the EU’s Schengen zone.
Besides, there is tremendous significance attached to Merkel’s decision. A strong advocate for open borders since the onset of the European migrant crisis in 2015, Merkel had staked her legacy on upholding the European Union. A core tenet of the bloc is to maintain open borders among EU states.
What is the extent of migration into Germany?
New arrivals to Germany and Europe have, in fact, dropped off almost entirely. For instance, more than 850,000 asylum seekers had arrived in Greece in 2015, with most of them eventually making their way to northern European countries like Germany; so far this year, a little more than 13,000 have made the same journey.
Why, then, has this come up now?
Many point to the October elections in Bavaria, a region sometimes described as the Texas of Germany because of its affluent areas and conservatism. Bavaria borders Austria.

"Kuldeep Yadav picked up his maiden five-for for India in T20Is. (AP Photo) Kuldeep Yadav picked up his maiden five-for for India in T20Is. (AP Photo)
Not sure about the football World Cup, but the dread is certainly coming home to England. Via a clean-shaven Kuldeep Yadav, who left England gobsmacked with a wonderfully-crafted five-for on Tuesday. Perhaps, Yadav should think about growing a goatee before the Tests start next month.
There is a delightful tale about the origins of Abdul Qadir’s goatee which made a sudden appearance on Pakistan’s 1982 tour of England. Imran Khan told him, “Grow it, it will develop an aura around you” — or in other words, the English would be haunted by your magician look.
Already, Qadir, who had started off with a normal action, had developed that famous whirly blurring arms to mystify the batsmen, and the final psychological tipping point was that goatee. The modern-day England’s batsmen aren’t as vulnerable mentally but the first T20, and Yadav’s trickery in the recent past, are enough to create a few doubts for sure. Goatee or not, one thing is sure, if there arises a (pitch) situation where just one spinner could play in the Tests, Indians would be foolish not to consider Yadav for that honour.
The already burgeoning evidence piled up more on Tuesday. Ask Joe Root. Fire up the cricket app on your smart phone and look at his dismissal. It might have been a T20, but Root wasn’t looking to hit out; survival was in his mind as he stretched forward to push at his first delivery.
Yadav produced a great spinning cliché: the one that hangs in the air, the one that dips suddenly at last moment, and one where the batsman is left groping in the dark. It was the googly, but that wasn’t enough to deceive Root. That would be too simple and a hark back to 80’s and 90’s England to the days of Robin Smith and Richard Blakey. Nah, this was much better. As Root stretched out, he must have realised he was in trouble.
The arms kept pushing out, the legs kept dragging out, the bat far out from the body but the damn little red thing wouldn’t arrive yet. And as a final act of doubt-filled hope, Root let his arms go through and actually stumbled out of his crease but the ball dipped and broke away with tremendous bounce that surprised even MS Dhoni, who recovered his poise to gently take out a bail.
This was a mike-drop moment for Yadav: England’s best batsman, fishing out in hope. He was so stunned and out of position that survival instinct didn’t kick in him quickly enough despite Dhoni’s fumble.
Johnny Bairstow, who has revamped his batting against spin in the recent years, too was left lurching in the dark. That googly again. And Bairstow had picked it, and tried to push it to covers but again Yadav had succeeded in disrupting the shape of the batsman. And Bairstow had a look on his face when he walked away, a glance at his partner, which said a thousand words.
Even the Alex Hales dismissal is a good one to observe closely. He had shuffled across a touch and gone for an aggressive sweep but couldn’t get any wood on the leather.
Of late, England batsmen have developed a technique that has worked well for them: No self-doubt in the shotmaking process. The bat-swings are much smoother, the intent is very visible, and they go all out in a shot. They trust their instinct and invest completely into the shot. It’s a good tactic but it deserves a slight adjustment now against Yadav. It’s not just the exoticness inherent in a Chinaman bowler that demands that caution, but by what he does with the ball.
That ability to make the ball seemingly hang in the air, loads of overspin that he imparts helps his case and demands more out of the batsmen. Not only do they need to pick his variations but need to be secure enough to delay their shot a touch, adjust the bat swing to cope.
It’s not easy, definitely not an easy for England’s batsmen as it tinkers with their recent successful approach. And that’s what makes this Yadav vs England contest all the more mouth-watering.
It’s not going to be easy for Yadav for sure. The recent case of Afghanistan’s Rashid Khan is a good example. He was almost unplayable in IPL but wasn’t that effective in the Test against India. Prior to the Test, it seemed he might cause real havoc but perhaps due to pressure and nerves of the occasion, he couldn’t reproduce that magic. Even Qadir picked just one wicket in his debut Test against England in 1977. But there is enough there in Kuldeep’s brief career for India to give him a run in Tests.
Yadav’s mentor-of-sorts Brad Hogg, the former Australian chinaman bowler who he first met in IPL and has kept a close touch over the years, has always desired one tweak in Yadav’s action.
“I would like him to straighten up in the delivery stride. He bends his knees a bit too much at release,” he had told this newspaper. It can help him be more fluent in the action, get more loop and revolutions on the ball, and hence the ability to hang the ball that much more in the air. Yadav was initially reluctant to do it as he wasn’t comfortable but one can see him attempt to do it of late. Especially on Tuesday.
There is another bit of advice from Hogg that has enough merit to be taken seriously. And this time, it’s addressed to the Indian team management. “If India need just one spinner, I think he is ready for it. He is not a T20 and ODI specialist, he is the real deal. Throw him in the Tests, I say!”

"Under the scheme, the Centre along with the respective state governments provides VGF. Airlines are awarded sectors through a bidding process. (PTI)
To provide air connectivity to popular tourist sites in the country, a separate bidding would be conducted under the UDAN scheme, the Civil Aviation Ministry said today.
The template for the bidding has been prepared and the process will be initiated once the viability gap funding (VGF) from the Tourism Ministry is finalised, a Civil Aviation Ministry official, Usha Padhee, said at a tourism investors meet here.
She, however, did not elaborate on the separate bidding process.
UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) scheme seeks to connect unserved and under-served airports as well as make flying more affordable.
Under the scheme, the Centre along with the respective state governments provides VGF. Airlines are awarded sectors through a bidding process.
The Civil Aviation Ministry had earlier indicated that the 12 sites identified for development under the “iconic tourist sites project” by the Tourism ministry could be considered for providing air connectivity. They include the most visited sites such as Khajuraho, Ajanta-Elora, Hampi and Kaziranga.
Padhee said both the ministries are working in tandem for increasing connectivity to tourist places and would be meeting every quarter to resolve connectivity-related issues.
The country’s civil aviation sector, she said, is growing at the rate of over 20 per cent and more than 30 per cent in the northeastern region.
The northeastern region, she said, would have a separate UDAN-international scheme soon. Flights from places such as Guwahati will be connected to destinations in the neighbouring countries.
The Assam government has already committed Rs 100 crore as viability gap funding for the success of the programme.
Responding to queries especially in regards to Khajuraho, a destination ignored by airlines despite having an operational airport, she said a “market driven demand” needed to be created for airlines to operate on daily basis.
The government, she said, cannot interfere with the commercial decisions of the airlines. Khajuraho is a typical case where air connectivity has remained poor despite a well developed airport as demands are season specific.
She asked the industry to develop a business model which can attract both scheduled and non-scheduled operators to connect tourist destinations such as Khajuraho on a regular basis.",www.financialexpress.com,2018-07-05 00:51:25,19,244691

"Zimbabwe's main opposition leader Nelson Chamisa made a veiled threat on Wednesday to boycott elections on July 30 if there is no agreement between the independent election agency and political parties on ballot papers.
HARARE: Zimbabwe's main opposition leader Nelson Chamisa made a veiled threat on Wednesday to boycott elections on July 30 if there is no agreement between the independent election agency and political parties on ballot papers.
Chamisa and his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) are the main rivals to President Emmerson Mnangagwa in the first presidential and parliamentary vote since Robert Mugabe resigned last November following an army coup.

The MDC is wary of any attempt to put it at a disadvantage to Mnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party, insisting there be a deal on how to design, print and store ballot papers.
Chamisa said his party rejected the papers being printed by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC).
""We do not and will not accept the current ballot paper that has been printed without our participation,"" he told reporters.
Asked whether he would boycott the polls if ZEC ignored his party's demands, Chamisa said: ""There will be no election, there can't be an election. Choose what to call it, but there can't be an election.""

He would not reveal how the MDC could stop the vote, in which 23 candidates are running for president, but added that the opposition would not ""repeat the mistakes of 2013"" when it suffered a crushing defeat.
The MDC called Mugabe's victory five years ago a monumental fraud that had been engineered through manipulation of the voters' register by state security agents.
ZEC chief Priscilla Chigumba said her commission alone was empowered to deal with the issue of ballot papers, and demands by the MDC were meant to usurp its powers.
Presidential and parliamentary ballots were being produced by the central bank's printing arm Fidelity Printers, she added in a statement.
An MDC official said the party had notified police it would demonstrate next Wednesday to press its demands. Thousands of MDC supporters marched to the ZEC offices on June 5, demanding reforms that the party said were vital for a credible vote.
Zimbabwe Defence Forces spokesman Colonel Overson Mugwisi separately rejected MDC allegations that soldiers had been deployed in rural areas to campaign for ZANU-PF and intimidate opponents.

After the Emergency, there was a view that the Supreme Court was suffering from a crisis of legitimacy, as illustrated by its pro-government judgments. In subsequent years, the court tried to dispel that impression through the public interest litigation. After January 12, 2018, when the four most senior judges made public their letter to the Chief Justice of India, fresh concerns were expressed about the independence of judges. Some experts suggested that when a powerful government with a massive majority assumes power, judges do not assert themselves in the same way as they do when a coalition government is ruling.
Wednesday’s judgment on the role of the Delhi Lieutenant-Governor has put to rest such doubts. Even before this, the CJI had decided the Arunachal Pradesh matter against the central government, and the judgment in the Hadiya case too had upheld her right to choose her spouse.
The 535-page, unanimous judgment of the five-judge Constitution Bench comes at a time when the central government has been justifying all actions of the Lt Governor. In fact, no Governor or Lt Governor really acts on his own. Indian Governors have traditionally been loyal to those ruling from Delhi. In the Arunachal case too, the Supreme Court had criticised then Governor J P Rajkhowa.
READ | Decisions of Delhi govt will not require the concurrence of L-G, says Supreme Court
CJI Dipak Misra wrote a powerful, 237-page, majority opinion on behalf of himself and Justices A K Sikri and A M Khanwilkar. Justice D Y Chandrachud, after the judgment on privacy, wrote yet another authoritative opinion in which he concurred with the CJI and noted that democracy is in danger from authoritarianism in several countries and there is a need for adherence to “constitutional morality”. He listed four foundational principles including secular ideology. Justice Ashok Bhushan, in a 123-page concurring opinion, emphasised purposive interpretation of the Constitution and representative government. Also, Justice Chandrachud allowed the Lt Governor to refer to the President only such matters that jeopardise national interest, thus narrowing the scope of the L-G’s power to do so.

Fundamental principles
Justice Misra devoted 120 pages or so to elaborating on 12 fundamental principles of India’s liberal constitutional democracy, with constitutionalism or the concept of limited powers as its central idea. He stressed purposive interpretation and sustenance of the “glory of constitutional democracy” so that the constitutional promise of representative democracy to citizens is fulfilled.
He observed that courts need to adopt pragmatic interpretation to further the spirit of the Constitution, rule of law and participatory democracy. The text of the Constitution, he observed, is to be read in the light of its avowed purpose and spirit. Quoting Thomas Jefferson, he said that a just government should derive its powers from the consent of the governed. Towards the end of his judgment, he used these very ideals in laying down the law on the powers of Delhi’s Lt Governor.
Justice Misra came down heavily on authoritarianism and reckless exercise of powers by any constitutional authority. In fact, he was indirectly deciding against himself — being a top constitutional functionary, he too is to be now guided by these high principles in the constitution of benches and the selection of judges.
The CJI also talked of the possibility of an elite, monopolising democracy and converting it into a government of the elite. But he did not highlight the dangers of majoritarianism — representative governments, at times, do turn against minorities and violate the spirit of the constitutional pact on the basis of which the nation itself was created. But he did say that every representative government must have accessibility and approachability and such a government should never sacrifice what the CJI termed the “conscience of the constitution”.
Justice Misra agreed that “constitutional morality” — absolute and unqualified adherence to constitutional principles — is not a natural instinct and concerted efforts need to be made to cultivate this fundamental value. He talked of “constitutional objectivity” as an idea of checks and balances so that the legislature and the executive operate only within their limited allotted spheres, as “legitimate constitutional trust” is based on separation of powers, with denial of absolute power to any one functionary being the larger goal.
L-G & ministers
The authoritative finding is that the Lt Governor is just an “administrator” and administrative head in a limited sense, and that he is bound by the “aid and advice” of the Council of Ministers. He has no independent powers of his own; he has to either go by the advice of ministers, or comply with the orders of the President on matters referred to him. He cannot interfere in every case, there is no need of his concurrence in each matter, and he can refer matters to the President only in exceptional situations and not in a “routine or mechanical manner”. This means the court has reversed the Delhi High Court judgment that had held that the Lt Governor is not bound by the “aid and advice” of ministers.
The CJI held that “any matter” in Article 239AA(4) does not mean “every matter”; the Lt Governor has to employ “constitutional objectivity” and exercise this power in the rarest of rare situations for valid reasons. The Lt Governor does not have the power to change every decision or differ with every decision of ministers. Certainly, just like Governors, he is to be apprised of every decision by the ministers, but his concurrence is not necessary. The CJI explicitly held that the Lt Governor’s difference of opinion with ministers should never be based on a perception of a “right to differ”, but should be based on “constitutional trust”. At the same time, ministers must keep in mind that Delhi is not a state and the Lt Governor is not a titular head; rather, he enjoys the powers of an administrator.
While negating the Centre’s arguments on the powers of the Lt Governor, the CJI did say that neither the Lt Governor nor ministers should feel that they have been lionised. They should rather feel that they have to serve constitutional norms, values and concepts.
The CJI concluded his judgment with an idea of “constitutional renaissance”, which is not a mere revival of old ideas but a blossoming of both expressed and silent ideals of the Constitution.

New Delhi: Before mysteriously hanging themselves to death on Saturday night, the family of 11 in Delhi’s Burari had ordered rotis (chapatti) which was delivered to their doorstep.
The order of 20 rotis, which was supposedly their last meal, was delivered by a young man named Rishi, who is probably the last person to see the family alive.
Recalling the time when he arrived to deliver the order, Rishi said the family seemed ""normal"" and showed no signs they would do something so horrifically tragic just hours later.
Rishi delivered 20 rotis - the Bhatia family hadn't ordered curry or anything else - and was paid Rs 200.
""They had placed an order for 20 rotis at 10:30 pm, I went to deliver it at 10:45 pm. The daughter took the order and asked her father to pay me. Everything was normal,'' Rishi told ANI news agency.
It was on Sunday morning that 10 members of the Bhatia family, including two 15-year-old boys and a young woman engaged to be married, were found hanging in the hallway. The 11th member, Narayan Devi, 77, was found dead on the floor.
According to the investigators, the handwritten notes found at the home point towards the hangings being of a ritualistic nature and the detailed steps noted in it to ""salvation"" were followed by younger son of Narayan Devi, Lalit Bhatia, who allegedly hallucinated about his father who died 10 years ago.

Weeks after vacating his government bungalow in a posh Lucknow locality following a Supreme Court order, SP president Akhilesh Yadav and wife, MP Dimple Yadav, are planning to open a hotel in the same area.
The ex-CM has submitted a blueprint of the proposed hotel — to be named ‘Hibiscus Heritage’ — to the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) for clearance along with No-Objection Certificates (NOCs). The Indian Express has a copy of the June 28 application he sent to the LDA.
Meanwhile, sources in the LDA said a similar application seeking approval for establishing a library on a plot — 2, Vikramaditya Marg — has been received from SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav. The plot is which is adjacent to 1-A, Vikramaditya Marg, where Akhilesh has proposed the hotel to be set up. Sources further said that the application is in the name of the “SP national president” and carries Mulayam’s photo. The LDA’s executive engineer of the map department is said to have forwarded the application to different departments — including the nagar nigam chief architect, managing director of the Lucknow Jal Sansthan, the estate officer, the police and others — for their approvals and NOCs.
A time of 15 days has been given to the concerned departments, sources said. Situated near the SP office, ‘1-A’ was a commercial plot bought by Akhilesh and Dimple in 2005. As the area is a high security zone, construction there cannot exceed a height of 7 metres. By this rule, both the hotel and the library cannot have more than two floors, sources said.
SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said, “Right now I am out of station and have no information about any such application or whether Akhilesh ji and Mulayam ji are planning anything like this. I believe no one at the party level has any such information….” LDA officials could not be reached for comment.

Srinagar: Home Minister, Rajnath Singh, on Wednesday evening held a series of meetings with senior government functionaries and the officers of various law enforcing agencies in Srinagar to review the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir and along the Line of Control (LoC).
During these discussions special focus is being set on the security arrangements and other logistic support put in place for the annual Amarnath Yatra. Singh is himself planning to fly to Amarnath on Thursday morning to pay obeisance at the 3,888-metre-high revered cave-shrine and oversee the arrangements made for the pilgrims.
Singh is being accompanied by National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval, and a team of officers from the Home Ministry including Home Secretary, Rajiv Gauba, and Joint Secretary Jammu and Kashmir, Gyanesh Kumar.
This is the Home Minister’s first visit of Jammu and Kashmir after the collapse of the PDP-BJP government and imposition of the Governor’s rule in the State a fortnight ago and comes amid speculations and rumours about the formation of a new government.
One such rumour purported that the BJP with its ally Sajad Gani Lone is trying to cause defections in the PDP in an attempt to garner the support of sufficient number of MLA to stake claim to government formation. The BJP has strongly denied it is in the race of forming a government in the State.
Earlier reports had suggested that the Congress and the PDP may cobble up an alliance in the run up to form a new government. Both the parties have ruled out such a possibility.
Before leaving for Srinagar, the Home Minister had tweeted “Heading to Srinagar on a two day visit to Jammu and Kashmir. During this visit the security situation of the state will be reviewed. Shall also perform darshan at the holy cave of Shri Amarnathji”.

The sources added that the Governor briefed Home Minister also about the ongoing Amarnath Yatra.
The yatra remained suspended on Wednesday following twin tracks beyond the base-camps of Baltal and (Chandanwadi) Pahalgam were hit by a series of landslides and shooting of stones in the impact of torrential rains.
On Tuesday, five pilgrims were killed and a few others injured when swept by a landslide along the 13-km Baltal-Amarnath track between Brarimarg and Railpathri. The officials said that the twin tracks have turned slippery at most other places prompting them to suspend the yatra.

""Tomorrow (Thursday) I will chair a meeting of the Government's emergency committee COBR in relation to the ongoing investigation,"" he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Two persons who came down Saturday with symptoms of poisoning in the British town of Amesbury were found to have been exposed to the same toxin as the ex-Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skrial and his daughter in Salisbury, the head of UK Metropolitan Police’s anti-terrorism unit said earlier on Wednesday.
The newest victims — a 45-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman — are critically ill in hospital. They were discovered unconscious at the same address in Wiltshire county in South West England, miles from where the Skripals were found collapsed in the park.
Chief Medical Officer Sally Davies told reporters on Wednesday that the risk to public health following hospitalization of two Britons in the town of Amesbury with symptoms of exposure to a Salisbury nerve agent remains low.
""I want to reiterate the police are still investigating how this incident happened. We want to reassure the public that risk to the public remains low,"" Chief Medical Officer Sally Davies told reporters on Wednesday.
Metropolitan Police anti-terrorism chief Neil Basu said earlier in the day police had cordoned off as a precaution a number of sites in the Amesbury and Salisbury areas that they believed the two victims had visited before they fell ill on Saturday.
Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench near a shopping mall in Salisbury on March 4. UK authorities blamed Russia for a murder attempt with what they believe to be a nerve agent of the Novichok class. Russia has denied any role in the poisoning.

"Nizhny Novgorod: Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani is likely to miss his side's World Cup quarter-final against France on Friday after suffering a calf injury in the last-16 win over Portugal.
The Uruguayan Football Association (UFA) posted photos of Wednesday's training session on social media, with Cavani a notable absentee.
After tests on Monday, doctors confirmed the Paris Saint-Germain star had suffered bruising to his left calf, although he had not torn a muscle.
With the 31-year-old Cavani set to be sidelined, Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez will likely play Cristhian Stuani up front alongside Luis Suarez for the two-time World Champions.
Girona forward Stuani replaced Cavani, after the latter had scored both goals in Uruguay's 2-1 victory against Portugal.

"Roger Federer advanced to the third round at Wimbledon 2018. (Reuters Photo) Roger Federer advanced to the third round at Wimbledon 2018. (Reuters Photo)
When Roger Federer’s lunging mis-hit spun high into the air and turned into a glorious lob, Lukas Lacko must have known it was going to be one of those days when he might as well enjoy having the best view in the house. It was just too bad the Slovakian could not put his feet up and enjoy the jaw-dropping spectacle.
Two days after creating a stir at Wimbledon with his new mega-bucks clothing deal, Federer was back making a style statement with his dazzling tennis as he gave Lacko a 6-4 6-4 6-1 dressing down to reach the third round on Wednesday.
The Swiss champion was at his breath-taking best as he crafted 48 exquisite winners during a 90-minute masterclass that seemed more an exhibition of his shot-making than a charge towards a record ninth Wimbledon title. The last time Federer turned up to defend his crown, in 2013, he suffered a shock second-round humbling by Sergiy Stakhovsky.
There was no danger of a repeat performance on Wednesday, however, and a forehand swish on match point gave the top seed a 26th consecutive set at the grasscourt major.
“On certain days it goes better than others,” summed up a grinning Federer, who will be seeking a 10th successive win at the All England Club when he takes on Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff in the third round.
Lacko had probably hoped he could throw some curve balls Federer’s way after enjoying a run to the Eastbourne final at the weekend. Unfortunately, it was the Slovakian who was left dodging the majestic missiles that kept raining down on his half of the court.
The top seed belted down 16 aces, hit the target with 70 percent of his first serves, dropped only three points on his first serve and did not even come close to facing a break point.
Federer fired three of those aces in a row to take the second set and he got his 15,000-strong Centre Court fan club gasping in astonishment as he produced a ridiculous backhand drop shot from behind the baseline.
The 36-year-old also collected 35 consecutive points on serve on his way to a 5-1 lead in the third set.
With Federer having an elegant answer to everything Lacko could throw at him, it was not until the 20-times Grand Slam champion walked off court that he was finally stumped.
When asked if he would prefer the umpire to announce ‘game Mr. Federer’ – just as the women are addressed as a “Miss” or “Mrs” here – rather than just “game Federer”, the man contesting his 20th consecutive Wimbledon admitted he was clueless about that particular tradition.
“Oh, I didn’t know that,” he said sounding bemused. Within seconds he added with a smile: “I’m happy whatever they say, as long as it is ‘game’ and my name and not ‘game’ and the other (person’s) name.”

"UN human rights experts urged China on Wednesday to release Liu Xia, the widow of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, and allow her to seek treatment for deteriorating health, including travelling abroad.
The appeal came nearly a year after Liu Xiaobo died of liver cancer on July 13, 2017 while in custody, having been jailed in 2009 for “inciting subversion of state power”.
Liu Xia, an artist and poet who suffers from depression, has been under effective house arrest since her husband was awarded the prize in 2010.
She has never been charged with any crime and was last seen in public at his funeral accompanied by Chinese authorities.
“We are disturbed by reports of the deteriorating health of Liu Xia. She is reportedly physically restricted at an unknown location and suffers from severe psychological distress,” UN independent experts on enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, and human rights defenders said in a joint statement.
“We reiterate our call to the Chinese government to disclose her whereabouts and release her,” they said.
China has repeatedly said Liu Xia is free and is accorded all rights guaranteed to her by Chinese law.
However, Beijing-based Western diplomats have said she has been closely monitored by Chinese authorities since her husband’s death and has only been able to meet and speak to friends and family in prearranged phone calls and visits.
A friend who recently spoke to her by telephone said in May that she was losing hope of leaving the country.
In the past, Chinese dissidents have been allowed to leave the country and take up residence in a willing Western nation.
But President Xi Jinping, who came to power in 2013, has presided over a sweeping campaign to quash dissent throughout Chinese society, detaining hundreds of rights activists and lawyers, with dozens jailed.
The UN experts voiced alarm at “the growing trend of deaths in custody in China” – who have included activist Cao Shunli in 2014 and Tibetan monk Tenzin Delek Rinpoche in 2016.
Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, in a speech last month, accused China of preventing independent activists from testifying before UN rights bodies. He voiced concern that conditions were “fast deteriorating” in the autonomous regions of Tibet and Xinjiang.
“A number of Chinese human rights lawyers are in detention or simply disappeared,” Alim Seytoff, director of the Uygur service at Radio Free Asia, said at a panel last week.
“The situation of freedom of expression of Uygurs in the northwest of China is even worse,” he said.
China, responding to “unfounded accusations” by Western states at the UN Human Rights Council, said last week that it encourages activists but “does not allow any organisation or individual to engage in subversive or destabilising activities using the pretext of protecting rights or freedom of speech”.

"THE GOVERNMENT is pursuing plans to revive the Subic Bay International Airport before the second quarter of next year, the state Transport chief said in a press briefing on Wednesday where other economic managers reiterated the commitment to push major infrastructure projects despite current delays.
Transportation Secretary Arthur P. Tugade said that his department has been in “serious talks with the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA)… already to buhayin ‘yung airport (revive the airport).”
“The way I see it, I think sa tamang panahon magiging operational… siguro hindi aabutin ng first or second quarter next year (it is time to make the airport operational… maybe before the first or second quarter),” Mr. Tugade said in a media briefing in New Clark City in Tarlac.
He cited the need to upgrade the airport’s safety equipment as a primary task.
“If you give life to the airport, which has been inoperable for a number of years, you have to look at the structure. The problem is the aviation instrument component… (so) that the airplane will land in a safe basis,” said Mr. Tugade, who first bared the intention to revive the airport in late 2016 after President Rodrigo R. Duterte assumed office.
The Subic Bay International Airport was FedEx’s Asia delivery hub before that facility closed down in 2009.
SBMA in April announced that it had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Asian Business Aviation Association (AsBAA) during the Asian Business Aviation Conference & Exhibition 2018 on April 17 in Shanghai, China to develop the airport “for business aviation.” Under that MoU, AsBAA will help develop the airport’s infrastructure “as well as assist in operations at the airport, while offering business aviation services in the Philippines through Subic.”
SBMA had quoted its chairman and administrator, Wilma T. Eisma, as saying she wanted Subic’s airport — which has been one of the facilities considered to help decongest Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Metro Manila — to focus on business and general aviation; maintenance, repair and overhaul services; and charter flights, leaving passenger aviation to Clark International Airport.
The national government has been moving to decongest Metro Manila by developing Clark and Subic freeport areas and improving links between these sites. In April, the National Economic and Development Authority approved the P50-billion 71.13-kilometer railway project that will connect Subic Bay Freeport Zone to Clark Freeport Zone.
In the same briefing yesterday, economic managers assured that the government has been pulling all stops to speed up infrastructure development now that the administration is approaching its halfway point.
Addressing the observation that official development assistance (ODA) financing has not been as prompt as initially hoped, Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III acknowledged that foreign governments’ “procedures can be tedious and long, but it is required by the citizens of that country because it is their money.”
“So we just have to live with that. That is a requirement all over the world… That it is the requirement of the people themselves through their legislators that makes the projects take a long time,” he added.
“I’m not making any excuses. We’re going as fast as we can.”
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto M. Pernia earlier said that China-funded projects have not been moving as fast as those bankrolled by Japan. “Japan just made their project processing fast and sure…” Mr. Pernia said.
Mr. Dominguez said that the government has been meeting with its Japanese and Chinese counterparts once every four months to address implementation backlogs.
Public Works and Highways Secretary Mark A. Villar said that civil works for the China-funded Estrella-Pantaleon and Binondo-Intramuros bridges will be “starting in July,” while the Chico River Pump Irrigation project will start later this year.
STILL FASTER
Asked whether the government will shift to private sector funding if ODA-funded projects will continue to be delayed, Mr. Dominguez replied: “You know the PPP (public-private partnership) is also very long.”
“We’ve done a study on how long PPP is: from project submission to start of the project is 30 months.”
He even noted that one private sector-funded project was delayed for 60 months after proponents filed lawsuits against each other.
Mr. Dominguez said the government will still proceed with the hybrid-PPP procurement model where government or ODA funding will kick-start the project while the private sector will be tapped for operation and maintenance.
“Our method of using our financing is working, is faster,” he insisted.
“So again, you know, it’s not as fast as many would wish, but we are pushing ahead. It’s moving forward quickly.”
Mr. Dominguez also took note of certain proponents seeking revenue guarantees from the government in some PPP contracts in the past.
“The banks like that because they take no risk. I think if you’re the private sector, you should take a risk to make your profit,” he said.
“Don’t ask the government to take away the risk component… why charge a higher rate to users if the financing cost is higher than ours. There’s a hidden guarantee all the time… why should there be a profit if there’s no risk?”
BUILDING THE STATE’S ASSET BASE
Moreover, the Finance chief said that government-led projects could be privatized in the future to raise revenues.
“While we are doing all these projects ourselves, the government is building up asset base that is going to be very large,” the Finance chief said.
“Future governments that may need money can privatize them. We can afford to do it now.”
ODA-financed projects aren’t only the ones facing backlogs, with Mr. Tugade saying that Surigao airport’s rehabilitation and the Light Rail Transit (LRT)-1 extension project have been slightly delayed.
“We’re trying to do a catch-up plan so that the improvement and the renovation in Surigao will come in a reasonable time… It’s a little bit delayed because the fund was supposed to come from another agency so we had to wait,” Mr. Tugade said.
“The LRT-1 Baclaran-Bacoor plan, we have targeted it to be completed and operational by 2021,” the Transport chief added.
“Starting actual construction is a bit delayed now, but we’re doing a catch-up with the local government units involved and hopefully we can still meet 2021.”
‘ALL OF US ARE IMPATIENT’
Bases Conversion and Development Authority President Vivencio B. Dizon, for his part, said: “All of us are impatient.”
“But I can tell you the most impatient person who really wants to get things done as fast as possible for everybody is the President of the Philippines. So we understand the impatience and this is because of neglect of past governments,” Mr. Dizon claimed.
“You’re going to see things progress even faster as we go through the next months.”
The Cabinet officials presented to journalists yesterday the site of the 40-hectare New Clark City Government Administrative Center Phase 1 that will house satellite offices of all the branches of the government.
The center will have a one-stop-shop “Business Continuity Center,” a disaster risk and recovery center and a sports complex that will be the venue for the 2019 South East Asian games which are all expected to become operational before 2020. — E.

"THE GOVERNMENT and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on June 29 for the regional lender’s $7.1-billion sovereign lending program to the Philippines for 2019–2021.
In a statement yesterday, ADB said the lending program will particularly support the current administration’s infrastructure program, with two-thirds of the financing pipeline — about $4.5 billion — going to projects that “connect regions and communities and manage urbanization, such as railways, bridges, roads and flood management.”
“ADB is committed to working closely and collaboratively with the government of the Philippines to ensure that we deliver on our pipeline of projects,” Kelly Bird, ADB’s country director for the Philippines, said after the signing ceremony.
This follows the meeting among the National Economic and Development Authority, Department of Finance and the ADB last month where the latter presented the borrowing program.
About $945 million is allocated this year, consisting of two policy-based loans worth $600 million, a $300 million results-based loan and $45 million in project loans.
“I am very happy about this program,” ADB’s statement quoted Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto M. Pernia said in his remarks during the ceremony.
“ADB has been very cooperative and helpful in our objectives to sustain our economic growth and achieve inclusive development. This will help bring us closer to our longer-term vision of a prosperous, middle-income country where no one is poor by 2040.”
It also quoted Finance Assistant Secretary Maria Edita Z. Tan as saying in the same event that “ADB has been a very responsive partner.”
“When we asked them to consider co-financing some of the large infrastructure projects under the BBB (Build, Build, Build) program,” she recalled. “ADB immediately stepped up to the challenge.”

"LONDON — Outflows of foreign investor money from emerging economies accelerated in June as markets were buffeted by trade tensions, higher borrowing costs and other headwinds, according to data from Institute of International Finance (IIF).
Non-resident portfolio outflows from emerging markets rose to $8 billion following an exodus of $6.3 billion in May, the IIF said in its monthly capital flows tracker.
Outflows were split about evenly between debt markets, which recorded a net loss of $4.2 billion, and equity markets at $3.8 billion.
“Unlike other recent bouts of EM outflows, this recent downturn has featured outflows from China, likely prompted by escalating US-China trade disputes and the sharp renminbi depreciation,” IIF analysts wrote in their report, adding the June data had capped off the weakest quarter for emerging market flows since the end of 2016.
“Trade tensions, coupled with diverging economic outlooks, have also prompted a marked upturn in portfolio allocations to US assets — at the expense of other developed markets as well as EMs.”
Emerging markets had a torrid June, suffering a broad selloff after the US Federal Reserve hiked rates and gave a more hawkish outlook than expected in June, as the dollar continued a relentless ascent and trade tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated.
Most major emerging market regions were suffering outflows, the IIF found, with $4 billion leaving Africa and the Middle East, $2.7 billion from emerging Asian economies, while $2.5 billion left Latin America.
“That said, given the prolonged weakness in EM flows, it would not be surprising to see a relief rally and some tactical rebalancing if the trade narrative improves and/or the US dollar heads lower,” the IIF report said. — Reuters",bworldonline.com,2018-07-05 00:32:52,8,118061

"BRUSSELS/BERLIN — China is putting pressure on the European Union (EU) to issue a strong joint statement against President Donald Trump’s trade policies at a summit later this month but is facing resistance, European officials said.
In meetings in Brussels, Berlin and Beijing, senior Chinese officials, including Vice-Premier Liu He and the Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, have proposed an alliance between the two economic powers and offered to open more of the Chinese market in a gesture of goodwill.
One proposal has been for China and the European Union to launch joint action against the United States at the World Trade Organization (WTO).
But the European Union, the world’s largest trading bloc, has rejected the idea of allying with Beijing against Washington, five EU officials and diplomats told Reuters, ahead of a Sino-European summit in Beijing on July 16-17.
Instead, the summit is expected to produce a modest communique, which affirms the commitment of both sides to the multilateral trading system and promises to set up a working group on modernizing the WTO, EU officials said.
Vice-Premier Liu He has said privately that China is ready to set out for the first time what sectors it can open to European investment at the annual summit, expected to be attended by President Xi Jinping, China’s Premier Li Keqiang and top EU officials.
Chinese state media has promoted the message that the EU is on China’s side, officials said, putting the bloc in a delicate position.
The past two summits, in 2016 and 2017, ended without a statement due to disagreements over the South China Sea and trade.
‘WE WON’T DO IT’
“China wants the European Union to stand with Beijing against Washington, to take sides,” said one European diplomat.
“We won’t do it and we have told them that.”
China’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Beijing’s summit aims.
In a commentary on Wednesday, China’s official Xinhua news agency said China and Europe “should resist trade protectionism hand in hand”.
“China and European countries are natural partners,” it said.
“They firmly believe that free trade is a powerful engine for global economic growth.”
Despite Mr. Trump’s tariffs on European metals exports and threats to hit the EU’s automobile industry, Brussels shares Washington’s concern about China’s closed markets and what Western governments say is Beijing’s manipulation of trade to dominate global markets.
“We agree with almost all the complaints the US has against China,” another diplomat said.
“It’s just we don’t agree with how the United States is handling it,” another diplomat said.
Still, China’s stance is striking given Washington’s deep economic and security ties with European nations. It shows the depth of Chinese concern about a trade war with Washington, as Trump is set to impose tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports on July 6.
It also underscores China’s new boldness in trying to seize leadership amid divisions between the United States and its European, Canadian and Japanese allies over issues including free trade, climate change and foreign policy.
“Trump has split the West, and China is seeking to capitalise on that. It was never comfortable with the West being one bloc,” said a European official involved in EU-China diplomacy.
“China now feels it can try to split off the European Union in so many areas, on trade, on human rights.”
Another official described the dispute between Mr. Trump and Western allies at the Group of Seven summit last month as a gift to Beijing because it showed European leaders losing a long-time ally, at least in trade policy.
European envoys say they already sensed a greater urgency from China in 2017 to find like-minded countries willing to stand up against Trump’s “America First” policies.
A report by New York-based Rhodium Group, a research consultancy, in April showed that Chinese restrictions on foreign investment are higher in every single sector save real estate, compared to the European Union, while many of the big Chinese takeovers in the bloc would not have been possible for EU companies in China.
China has promised to open up. But EU officials expect any moves to be more symbolic than substantive.
They say China’s decision in May to lower tariffs on imported cars will make little difference because imports make up such a small part of the market. China’s plans to move rapidly to electric vehicles mean that any new benefits it offers traditional European carmakers will be fleeting.
“Whenever the train has left the station we are allowed to enter the platform,” a Beijing-based European executive said.
However, China’s offer at the upcoming summit to open up reflects Beijing’s concern that it is set to face tighter EU controls, and regulators are also blocking Chinese takeover attempts in the United States.
The European Union is seeking to pass legislation to allow greater scrutiny of foreign investments.
“We don’t know if this offer to open up is genuine yet,” a third EU diplomat said. “It’s unlikely to mark a systemic change.” — Reuters",bworldonline.com,2018-07-05 00:31:46,32,118004
"(Reuters Health) - Health clinics where low-income people in the U.S. obtain medical care don't always offer help with quitting smoking - and availability of that assistance may vary by patients' ethnicity and insurance, a recent study suggests.
So-called safety net clinics exist to reduce barriers to healthcare. Patients at these clinics have higher-than-average rates of smoking, so it's particularly important to address these disparities, said Dr. Steffani Bailey, a family medicine researcher at Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine in Portland.

""We need to ensure that all patients, particularly in these settings, are getting access to the assistance that they need to help them to quit smoking,"" she said in an email.
Bailey and her team examined electronic health record data from 136,314 smokers at 143 clinics in 12 states between 2014 and 2016. The researchers analyzed the type of smoking cessation assistance these patients received - whether it was no assistance, counseling only, medication only or counseling and medication together.
They also looked at whether age, gender, race, income level, insurance status and the presence of medical and psychiatric conditions influenced who received cessation help.
The odds of getting both counseling and medication - which is considered best practice - were lower among patients of all ethnicities combined than they were among non-Hispanic whites, the researchers found.

Patients with Medicaid, the government insurance for low-income recipients, had 17 percent higher odds of receiving counseling and medication compared with commercially-insured patients, but uninsured people had the lowest odds, the study team reports in the American Journal of Public Health.
With few exceptions, the study found, women, older people and those with co-existing medical conditions were the most likely to receive assistance with quitting smoking.
While other studies have used electronic health record data, Bailey said, hers is the first to examine predictors of smoking cessation assistance from such a large sample. The study was limited by the fact that researchers do not know the reasons for some patients not receiving smoking cessation medication. They also didn't have data on patients who purchased nicotine replacement therapy over the counter.
Bailey said her team plans to interview patients and providers and observe clinic visits to better understand why smoking is, or is not, being addressed in these visits.
Dr. Andy Tan, an assistant professor at the Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston who wasn't involved in the study, said researchers' access to electronic health records provides previously unavailable data on service delivery for a large number of patients.
""This is important because this will accelerate the identification of gaps in delivery of smoking cessation among subgroups of patients who smoke, to target training, patient education, and system change that ultimately eliminates disparities in providing this service,"" he said in an email.
The U.S. Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline recommends that clinicians offer brief smoking cessation interventions at nearly all encounters, Bailey said.
They recommend the ""5 A's model"" (Ask about smoking, Advise to quit smoking, Assess willingness/readiness to quit smoking, Assist patient in quitting smoking, and Arrange follow-up). The clinician should discuss medication with the patient and should offer it unless there is a reason, such as pregnancy, that it should not be prescribed, Bailey said.
Offering medication and behavioral counseling together is considered the most effective way to help people quit smoking, said Dr. Kristine Browning of The Ohio State University College of Nursing and The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center-James Cancer Hospital in Columbus, who wasn't involved in the study.
""To continue to close the disparity gaps that exist in healthcare, it is essential that behavioral researchers and healthcare providers continue to illuminate healthcare disparities where they exist, and work toward multifactorial solutions to eliminate disparity and improve patient outcomes."" she said in an email. ""All patients deserve that highest evidenced-based treatment.""

"LAHORE : Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Wednesday said that former prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) chief Nawaz Sharif can appear before the accountability court if extends the date for verdict.
Talking to media after appearing before the court in case pertaining to his lifetime disqualification, he said that he would respect the verdict of the court whether the judgement would be in his favor or not.
Commenting on the ex-PM Nawaz Sharif, he said that the PML-N supremo was in London due to the illness of former first lady Begum Kulsoom Nawaz, adding that he can appear if the court extends the date for verdict in Avenfield reference.
On other hand, the Lahore High Court (LHC) summoned Returning Officer in case pertaining to lifetime disqualification of Shahid Khaqab Abbasi along with complete record tomorrow.
The court remarked, “Mr Abbasi! We want to speak directly with you. The government changes with time but the courts work as per law. Being a judge is not as easy as it seems. Stop talking against us. You have to come in these same courts if it’s not your government next time. You will not appear before any Australian court.”
“PPP did not say a word after whatever happened with them. You also have the same respect as it is of someone else. We carry no agenda. Keep working according to your plan but refrain from giving statements against judiciary,” directed the judge.
“Don’t you know that Nawaz Sharif was hit by a shoe, stones were pelted on Bilawal in Karachi and ink was hurled at Khawaja Asif? You are a former premier, try saving and rectifying the system. Although this matter is not relevant but it is necessary to speak all this,” said the judge.
On June 27, an eight-page verdict issued by Justice Ibadur Rehman Lodhi declared that Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is not eligible to become Member of Parliament under Article 62 (1) (F) of the constitution as he is not Sadiq and Amin.
The verdict says that Shahid Khaqan Abbasi declared the value of his F-7/2 house in Islamabad as three hundred thousand rupees in order to obtain a loan of 25 million rupees.
He also under declared his assets in nomination papers which is a clear discrepancy in oath of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.
The tribunal in its verdict stated that the former premier concealed facts and didn’t provide all information, however, disqualified Abbasi for life from contesting elections from NA-57 Murree.

Rahul Gandhi who was addressing a rally in Fursatganj, the Congress chief said that the bullet train is like a magic train which may never materialise. Not a first time when Rahul Gandhi has criticised one of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flagship projects. There have been instances in the past when Rahul Gandhi has criticised PM Modi-led government projects and said that the government was only working for the corporate sector.
Previously, India’s Metro man E Sreedharan during an interview to a national daily spoke about the Bullet Train project and said that it was highly expensive and something which is meant only for the elite and was beyond the reach for common people.
Congress chief Rahul Gandhi also hit out at PM Modi’s government and raked up the note ban issue. Rahul said the demonetisation has done nothing but devastated and created troubles for businessmen in the country. Rahul Gandhi also met a farmer’s family to offer his condolence, who died while waiting in order to sale his crop at a government centre.
Rahul Gandhi also blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for sharing photo ops moments with Chinese President Xi Jinping after issues and events like Doklam had already taken place in the recent past.

"TAXILA : Disgruntled Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) leader Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan on Wednesday hit out at Maryam Nawaz for taunting him for picking jeep symbol to contest the July 25 election as an independent candidate.
Speaking to media here, he sought to explain the reason behind his selection of this symbol, saying it was picked after deliberation with his close aides from his constituency because it is clear and easily understandable.
A day earlier, Maryam, the daughter of former premier Nawaz Sharif, had said jeep is the symbol of aliens.
Nisar said anyone wanted to visit his constituency can do so, which he said worried him in the least. He served his constituents for the past 34 years. He asked his detractors to point out any nook and cranny of the area where there are no signs of his service.
Nisar said the PML-N president issued a statement which an unknown party spokesperson later said didn’t reflect party policy. “This is the situation. Where the party is heading. Who is controlling it. These are multiple questions which are unfortunate and have upset every Muslim Leaguer.”
Previously, he said, he held his peace and didn’t talk about his rift with the former premier because of ill-health of Kulsoom Nawaz.
But now since her condition was stable; therefore, he wanted to place before the nation certain facts about his break with the PML-N supreme leader, he said.
Nisar said this all has been happening against him for the past 10 months.
He said he quit the office of Interior Minister and didn’t become part of the new cabinet after he developed differences with the party and rather shifted his focus on his constituency.

"LONDON : Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) chief Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday requested accountability court to postpone verdict in Avenfield reference for few days citing Kulsoom Nawaz’s critical health.
He was talking to media outside Harley Street Clinic in London.
His wife has been on life-support machines for the past 21 days and underwent a medical procedure, he added. He stressed that the decision should be deferred as it won’t undermine justice.
Speaking to reporters in London, the PML-N president said he would return to the country once the condition of his wife Kusloom Nawaz, who is on a ventilator at a hospital there, gets better.
Nawaz Sharif has demanded that the accountability court which is scheduled to announce its verdict in the Avenfield properties case against him on July 6 should defer it for a few days so that he could return to the country to hear it in his presence in the courtroom.
Nawaz went on to say that he would not abscond as he was not a dictator. “I faced unilateral proceedings [in the Avenfield reference]. I want to be in the courtroom to hear the verdict”, added Nawaz.
The PML-N chief warned to set an example out of those who are halting the path of masses. He said, “People are aware of revengeful proceedings being carried out against me”.
The former premier stated that he would not let down his stalwarts by displaying cowardly attitude. He added, “I will return to Pakistan even if verdict comes against me. One has to face adversities for accomplishment of the mission”.
Nawaz said he would render any sacrifice for masses’ rights and sanctity of vote.
Nawaz Sharif claimed that Pakistan has been passing through worst phase in its recorded history and warned foes that masses would announce their verdict on July-25.
Sharif said he is a public representative and won’t be worried, nor will he display cowardice in the face of hardships.
The accountability court on Tuesday reserved its verdict in the Avenfield reference filed against the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supreme leader Nawaz Sharif and members of his family.

"India had engaged in maritime dialogue with China around two years ago also but this time it will be focused on the situation in Indo-Pacific. (PTI)
In a significant move, India has proposed a bilateral maritime dialogue with China primarily to find a common ground in the Indo-Pacific region which is witnessing rapidly evolving security dynamics.
Sources said the maritime dialogue is being initiated as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a broader vision for the Indo-Pacific which he had articulated in his address at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore last month.
The move assumes significance as India is part of the powerful “Quadrilateral” coalition which was given shape in November last year primarily to free the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific from Chinese influence.
India has proposed similar maritime dialogue with Russia with an aim to build a consensus on having a rules-based framework in the region.
“Our effort is to work out with major players to achieve coherence in the region,” said a source.
In his address in Singapore, Modi had presented a seven-point vision and called for a rules-based order for the region which, he said, should be evolved through dialogue.
He also said that the world will have a better future when India and China work together with trust and confidence while being sensitive to each other’s interests.
Sources said Chinese President Xi Jinping had made “positive references” to Modi’s speech at Shangri-La dialogue.
A number of powerful countries including the US and Japan have been pitching for a greater role by India in the Indo-Pacific which has been witnessing China’s naval assertiveness.
The sources said the maritime dialogue with China may take place in the next couple of weeks.
“We are engaging with key players to work out on the concept of a stable Indo-Pacific,” the source said.
India had engaged in maritime dialogue with China around two years ago also but this time it will be focused on the situation in Indo-Pacific.
Last November, India, the US, Australia and Japan gave shape to the long-pending “Quad” to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of Chinese influence.
The four countries held their second meeting under the “Quad” grouping in Singapore last month during which they deliberated on common concerns in the region and the way forward.

"During interrogation, the trio admitted to have been involved in theft cases (File)
Three alleged members of a gang, who were involved in stealing bags from vehicles at parking lots of Connaught Place and other areas have been arrested, police said on Wednesday.

"BEIJING : State councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi held talks here with the President of the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly Lechak and called for joint efforts to address global threats such as terrorism.
He said, climate change is another issue, which needed to be tackled with a collective approach. Under the current international situation, how to adhere to, improve and develop multilateralism is a growing challenge for the entire global community. Multilateralism in the new era should insist.
Aiming at cooperation and mutual benefit, a global challenge requires a global response, and one country or several countries cannot do it alone.
It is even more unpopular to engage in the transfer of contradictions in the country. To achieve sustainable peace and common development in the world, we must adhere to win-win, win-win and win-win, and advocate for joint construction and sharing, he added.
It should be based on the rules of order. We must defend the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Every country must honour its promises and fulfill its international obligations. It must not adopt the attitude of “the rules are not used and abandoned.” All countries must strive to align with high international standards, and of course take care of the actual situation in various regions of the country, he added.
Wang Yi went on to add: “The principle of fairness and justice should be taken. Without pursuing justice, multilateralism cannot stand; without achieving fairness, multilateralism is not far away.
To ensure the broad and equal participation of countries in global governance, the most important thing is to expand the representation and voice of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries in international affairs.
It should be guided by effective action. Multilateralism cannot stop at the verbal, but must fall on its actions. What is to be done now is that all countries jointly safeguard the international system with the UN as the core, jointly safeguard the WTO-centered international trade rules, jointly promote the resolution of regional hotspot issues through dialogue and consultation.”
Meanwhile, a spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Minister Lu Kang said at the weekly news briefing that the Foreign Minister Wang Yi will attend the forthcoming meeting of foreign ministers on Iranian Nuclear issue and visit Austria.
This meeting is the first foreign ministers’ meeting held by the existing participants of the comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue under the new situation.
China, he said has always believed that the comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue is an important achievement of multilateralism and plays an important role in safeguarding the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East, in line with the common interests of the international community.
The presence of State Councilor Wang Yi showed the clear position of China to maintain the Iranian nuclear agreement.

"ISLAMABAD : Former President of Pakistan and President Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) Asif Ali Zardari has said that July 05, 1977 is a black day of our national calendar when a military dictator overthrew a democratic government and executed an elected Prime Minister.
In his message on the 41st anniversary of the military coup, Asif Ali Zardari said, “We denounce dictatorship; we also resolve to banish bonapartism and never allow it to rear its ugly head”.
He said that on this day began the process of decimating the Constitution, nurturing of militants and privatization of jehad.
On this day began the hijacking of the state institutions and erasure of the constitutionally drawn lines between them, the PPPP President added.
He said that on this dark day the PPP warns against dictatorial tendencies and calls upon all state institutions to remain within the Constitutional limits. Chairman PPP Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has already denounced attempts at manipulating democracy and censoring media, he stated.
Asif Zardari said that the PPP also calls for bringing to justice the latter day bonapart who has fled justice after abrogating the constitution in 2007.
He further said that on this dark day the PPP denounces the mysterious stifling of the media and the unannounced censorship as unacceptable infringement of rights of citizens and expresses solidarity with the professional media bodies.
On this day we also pay homage to all those who suffered in the cause of democracy, ‘the nation’s heroes and heroines’ Asif Zardari added.

"The loopholes at the back of Arsenal's defence have been addressed and rectified remarkably by the Spanish manager. And when a team is rock-solid at the back, it can more than flourish in the midfield and thrive in the attack.
When Arsene Wenger left Arsenal in the summer of 2018, the frustration of fans was at its peak as the North London club had failed twice in a row to breach the top four of Premier League. From the benchmark that Wenger had set in the past, 22 long years, finishing outside the top four was an all-time low for the club. Much of it was blamed on the French manager’s reluctance to address defensive deficiencies and overtly reliance on the attack.
However, that is not the case with the newly-appointed head coach Unai Emery. Upon arrival, the Spaniard immediately pondered on the weak and declining defence and bolstered it with three fine signings.
Unai Emery first recruited veteran defender Stephan Lichtsteiner from Juventus to give competition at right back spot to Hector Bellerin, whose development had stagnated in the past two years.
The former Sevilla and PSG manager then addressed the goalkeeping department which included the increasingly error-prone Petr Cech and David Ospina. He secured the signature of highly-rated Bernd Leno from Bayer Leverkusen. The German goalkeeper is an absolutely top-notch player who can command his centre-backs effectively.
The masterstroke of Emery came early in July when he signed defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos from Borussia Dortmund. The 19-year-old central defender is a true leader on the pitch and perfectly able to marshal the troops at the back.
The loopholes at the back of Arsenal’s defence have been addressed and rectified remarkably by the Spanish manager. And when a team is rock-solid at the back, it can more than flourish in the midfield and thrive in the attack.
All that Arsenal and Arsenal fans need now is Premier League to commence so that they can see their newly-recruited team play.

"ISLAMABAD : The Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCP) to tackle the issue of water scarcity has ordered the immediate construction of Bhasha and Mohmand Dam.
The SC under Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar on Wednesday heard a case related to scarcity of water and construction of new dams.
Water resources are pertinent not only for human lives but for the country’s stability, the court orders said.
It further said that the Council of Common Interest did not express any reservation against Bhasha and Mohmand Dam.
During the hearing of case, the CJP remarked, “How much water are we wasting?”
The ministry of power and water responded that water worth millions of dollars is being wasted, adding that in one year 90 million acre-feet water is wasted.
He said that after Tarbela, a new dam should be built every ten years.
According to the ministry of power and water, one million acre-feet water costs $500 million.
During the hearing, the CJP asked why the government does not want dams to be built, to which the officials of the ministry responded that the underlying issue is that it isn’t the government’s priority.

"Islamabad :
A top US official has met with Pakistan’s powerful Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and reminded him about Islamabad’s commitment to eliminate all terrorist groups present within its borders.
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells visited Islamabad this week and met with Pakistan’s top civil and military leadership and exchanged views on issues of mutual interest, regional security and cooperation between the two countries. Besides Gen Bajwa, she also met with Finance Minister Shamshad Akhtar, Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua, Chief of General Staff Lt Gen Bilal Akbar and business leaders and ambassadors of other nations in Islamabad.
During her meetings, Wells reminded the Pakistani leaders of their commitment to take action against all terrorist groups on its territory. “Wells discussed Pakistan’s stated commitment to eliminating all terrorist groups present within its borders, as well as our shared interest in building economic and commercial ties that benefit both nations,” the US embassy said in a statement here in an apparent reference to the Afghan Taliban militants.
The embassy said that Wells’ discussion was consistent with the Trump administration’s South Asia and Afghanistan strategy.
President Donald Trump had slammed Pakistan for its continued support to terrorist groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so while announcing his Afghan and south Asia policy in August.
Since then top US leadership, including the defence secretary and the secretary of state, have visited Pakistan to press the latter.
Ambassador Wells’ visit focused on the role that Pakistan can play in achieving a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Afghanistan, the statement said.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of the Pakistan Army, in a statement said Wells appreciated the role Pakistan Army has played in battling the scourge of terrorism.
Wells and Gen Bajwa “reaffirmed the commitment towards the common goal of peace and stability in the region and discussed measures towards that end. Both also agreed on continued engagement at multiple levels,” it said.
Pak SC summons asset details from Musharraf and Zardari
Islamabad: Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Wednesday sought details of former presidents Pervez Musharraf and Asif Ali Zardari while hearing a case on the recovery of losses incurred because of the controversial National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO). The apex court ordered that all respondents should declare their properties held abroad as well as foreign accounts and any offshore companies they own in affidavits submitted to the court, Dawn News reported.
The NRO was promulgated in October 2007 by the government of the then president Musharraf. Under the ordinance, cases against politicians were removed, paving the way for many of their return to country. Chief Justice Saqib Nisar also ordered former attorney general Malik Qayyum to provide details of his assets.
JuD chief Saeed launches intense poll campaign
Mumbai attack mastermind and banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed has launched an intense election campaign in different parts of Pakistan urging people to vote for his candidates in the July 25 general elections to safeguard the two-nation ideology and avert a water crisis.Saeed inaugurated the election offices of the Milli Muslim League (MML), the political wing of the JuD, in Lahore, Islamabad, Sahiwal, Sargodha, Faisalabad and Jhang and addressed rallies there during the last one week. The appeal he is making in his speeches is “vote for those who can stop India from building dams on Pakistani rivers so that Pakistan do not face water crisis in days to come, safeguard the two-nation ideology and help Kashmiris to get freedom and make the country a strong citadel of Islam”.
Saeed also promises to provide a “new political leadership’ that will change the destiny of Pakistan.",www.freepressjournal.in,2018-07-05 00:20:15,20,364322
"Sector grows at fastest pace in a year, boosts hiring
Mumbai : The services sector returned to growth during June and registered the fastest rate of expansion in a year, supported by robust increase in new business orders, said a monthly survey.
The Nikkei/IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers’ Index climbed to 52.6 last month, its highest since June 2017, from 49.6 in May. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
The recovery in services firms’ activity, along with a robust pace of manufacturing growth reported on Monday lifted the composite PMI to 53.3, its highest level since October 2016.
That points to a solid finish for the three months ending in June, the first quarter of this fiscal year, after the economy grew at its quickest pace in nearly two years in January-March.
“The service economy returned to expansion territory in June. Encouragingly, the latest performance was the strongest seen in a year, against a backdrop of improving demand conditions,” said Aashna Dodhia, Economist at IHS Markit, and author of the report.
A strong improvement in demand also encouraged firms to hire at a faster pace than in May.
A sub-index that tracks growth in output prices fell to its lowest level in more than a year, even as the rise in input costs slowed just marginally.
“Overall input costs rose at the strongest rate since July 2014, and amid a weak rupee and higher oil prices, inflation may remain elevated,” added Dodhia.
On the price front, input cost inflation remained solid overall, however, services providers were unable to fully pass on higher input costs to price-sensitive consumers.
“Overall input costs rose at the strongest rate since July 2014, and amid a weak rupee and higher oil prices, inflation may remain elevated,” Dodhia said, adding that given these circumstances, the chances of further monetary policy tightening have heightened.
In June, the Reserve Bank of India had upped its retail inflation projection by 0.30 per cent and kept the policy stance in the neutral zone, even as it hiked the key rate by 0.25 per cent to 6.25 per cent. Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Composite PMI Output Index that maps both the manufacturing and the services industry, rose from 50.4 in May to 53.3 in June.
The latest reading is the strongest since October 2016, indicative of a solid rate of expansion.
“The PMI data signalled the best improvement in the overall health of the economy since October 2016, propelled by solid growth in both the manufacturing and service economies,” Dodhia said.",www.freepressjournal.in,2018-07-05 00:20:11,16,365034
"Mumbai : Nearly 70 large accounts with exposure worth Rs 3.8 trillion will require resolution under the Reserve Bank of India’s revised framework by September, warns a report.
These accounts are mainly from the power, engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) and telecom sectors.
The report also said state-run banks are estimated to report pre-tax loss of Rs 41,900-1,01,600 crore in the current fiscal depending on the haircuts they may have to undertake on stressed assets undergoing resolution.
In FY18, PSBs reported a loss before tax of Rs 1.30 trillion.
“We estimate an additional Rs 3.8 trillion of exposure across 70 large accounts to require resolution by September 1,” rating agency Icra’s head for financial sector ratings Anil Gupta said on Wednesday.
Of these, 34 accounts total 41,000 mw of power generation capacity with total debt of Rs 2 trillion. This accounts will require a resolution under the revised resolution framework.
Of the Rs 3.8-trillion exposure, the agency estimates that nearly 92 per cent is already classified as NPAs by the lenders.
Gupta said with limited recovery witnessed in some of the earlier cases undergoing resolution except for accounts belonging to steel sector and high share of power sector exposure in 70 large accounts; a significant uncertainty prevails on the haircuts banks may need to take upon resolution.
In a scenario of 60-65 per cent provisioning requirements on accounts to be resolved and normal slippages of 3 per cent, the credit provisions for state banks
are estimated at Rs 1.4-2 trillion, which in addition to losses on bond portfolios will translate in overall losses for PSBs during FY19, he said.
The report said with the ongoing resolution of stressed assets, gross NPAs and net NPAs for banking sector are likely to come down to 10 per cent and 4.3 per cent, respectively by March 2019, which otherwise could have been higher at 12.2 per cent and 5.6 per cent, respectively.
As of March 2018, gross NPAs and net NPAs were at 11.6 per cent and 6.2 per cent, respectively.
The report expects credit provisions for private sector banks to come down to Rs 22,500-33,300 crore in FY19 as against Rs 50,300 crore in FY18.
Unsecured loans rise 4-times
Mumbai: Banks’ unsecured loan book has grown four times the bank credit during the past three years, helped by a rise in discretionary spending, technology-driven disbursements and lower interest rates, says a report.
Unsecured loans are the loans where individual exposures are smaller and more distributed and given without any collaterals but banks get higher margins. “Between fiscals 2015 and 2018, unsecured credit -comprising personal, small and medium enterprise (SME), and credit card loans – clocked a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27 per cent, or almost four times growth in bank credit,” Crisil said on Wednesday. As of March 2018, outstanding unsecured loans stood at around Rs 5 trillion, accounting for 26 per cent of retail lending, compared to 21 per cent three years ago. Growth in unsecured loans is on account of a surge in discretionary spending, increased availability of customer data, faster disbursements driven by technology, and lower interest rates in some segments.",www.freepressjournal.in,2018-07-05 00:19:45,18,365102
"New Delhi : The Supreme Court on Wednesday suggested that the realty firm Jaiprakash Associates (JAL) should pay Rs 600 crore, instead of Rs 1,000 crore ordered earlier, to refund the principal amount to the hassled home buyers.
A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra asked senior advocate F S Nariman, representing JAL, to take instruction from JAL on depositing Rs 600 crore with the apex court registry.
It said that after the amount is deposited, it would ask the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) at Allahabad to expeditiously decide the firm’s plea on revival or restructuring of its subsidiary firm — Jaypee Infratech (JIL).
The bench had on May 16 directed JAL to deposit 1,000 crore by June 15, in addition to Rs 750 crore already deposited, by June 15 to provide refunds to the home buyers who had wished to opt out of its various housing schemes.
“This case (of home buyers) can be disposed of if they (JAL) deposit Rs 600 crore for refund of the principal amount. We will ask the NCLT to decide the company petition (of JAL),” the bench said. The court also made it clear that it would deal with the issue of refund of money to only those home buyers who do not want possession of their homes. On being informed that Rs 750 crore has already been deposited with the apex court and another Rs 600 crore would be required to pay the principal amount to home buyers, the court asked the realty firm to “establish its bonafide” by paying the money.",www.freepressjournal.in,2018-07-05 00:18:30,8,364561
"China's HNA group chairman Wang Jian dies from 15 metre fall while posing for photo in France
Posted
The co-chairman of HNA Group, a conglomerate that operates China's fourth-largest airline and finance, logistics and other businesses around the world, died in an accident while on a business trip in France, the company said.
Key points: Wang was in charge of the companies strategy and day-to-day operations
HNA has been forced to sell off assets due to increased pressure from Beijing
Social media posts on China's Weibo site about the death appeared to be censored
Wang Jian, a co-founder of the company, suffered ""severe injuries"" in a fall in Provence in southern France and died Tuesday at age 57, said an HNA Group statement.
It gave no other details.
Wang fell 15 metres off a wall in the village of Bonnieux, near Avignon, a picturesque area popular with tourists, lieutenant-colonel Hubert Meriaux of the Vaucluse gendarmerie force told Reuters.
""He stood on the edge of a sharp drop to get his family to take a picture of him and fell,"" he said.
Launched in 1993 on the southern island of Hainan, HNA expanded into finance, hotels, logistics and other businesses in a multibillion-dollar global acquisition spree.
More recently, HNA has been selling some assets as Chinese regulators tighten lending controls and press companies to rein in debt.
Wang, 57, is regarded as the architect of an eye-popping $50 billion acquisition spree that saw HNA accumulate assets ranging from a stake in Deutsche Bank AG to high-profile overseas properties.
HNA also holds a 19 per cent stake in Virgin Australia Holdings, who operate the popular Virgin Australia airlines.
But, under pressure from Beijing, HNA has sold off many of its prime assets to slash debt, with recent sales including holdings in companies such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc, Park Hotels & Resorts and Spain's NH Hotels.
Earlier this week, HNA was also forced to terminate a $400 million deal with Australia's Automative Holdings Group for their refrigerated logistics and trucking arm, with AHG citing HNAs cashflow options as the cause of the breakdown.
Wang was in charge of HNA's strategy and ran day-to-day operations, sources familiar with the matter have said, while his fellow chairman and co-founder Chen Feng was often the public face of the group.
""HNA Group extends deepest condolences to Mr Wang's family and many friends,"" HNA's board and management team said in a statement.
""Together, we mourn the loss of an exceptionally gifted leader and role model, whose vision and values will continue to be a beacon for all who had the good fortune to know him, as well as for the many others whose lives he touched through his work and philanthropy.""
Social media posts about Wang's death appeared to have been censored on China's tightly controlled internet soon after the news was announced by the group.
""HNA Wang Jian died"" briefly ranked 11th on the Twitter-like Weibo's hot topics page, but was quickly gone from the top 50.
""It's really shocking news to us,"" said an employee who works in finance at HNA, declining to give his name.
""Everyone in the office is talking about it, but we don't know what impact it will have on the company's direction.""
Wang graduated from the Civil Aviation University of China and received an MBA from the Maastricht School of Management in the Netherlands, according to his company.
He held a 15 per cent stake in HNA.

"London : A man and woman are in a critical condition after being exposed to an “unknown substance” and found unconscious close to where a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned with a deadly nerve agent, prompting British counter terrorism officers to launch a massive probe.
The pair, in their 40s, were found unconscious in a property on Saturday in what was thought to be in a drugs-related incident in Amesbury, Wiltshire, the BBC reported on Wednesday.
Further tests on the substance are being carried out to identify it, the report said.Amesbury is about 16 kilometres from Salisbury, where former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with Novichok, a suspected military nerve agent, in March. The Metropolitan Police said counter terrorism officers are now working with Wiltshire Police “given the recent events in Salisbury”.Police said the couple were found at a house in Muggleton Road, Amesbury. While it was not clear whether a crime had been committed, the force said, a number of places in Amesbury and Salisbury known to have been frequented by the couple had been cordoned off.
“It was initially believed that the two patients fell ill after using possibly heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs,” Wiltshire Police said.”They are both currently receiving treatment for suspected exposure to an unknown substance at Salisbury District Hospital,” it added.
The couple are believe to have attended a family fun day at Amesbury Baptist Church on Saturday afternoon before they were found unconscious in the property. Roy Collins, church secretary, said “nobody else has suffered any ill-effects” from attending the community event and “there was nothing going on that was nefarious”.
“There have been no reports of any other incidents,” he said. “We are all quite puzzled and shocked – naturally the connection with Salisbury and recent events there mean there is a heightened public interest.”",www.freepressjournal.in,2018-07-05 00:18:05,10,364667

On June 24, women celebrated taking the wheel for the first time in decades as the ultra-conservative kingdom overturned the world's only ban on female drivers.
For decades, arch-conservatives justified the ban saying that allowing female motorists would promote gender mixing and promiscuity.
Sherif said she faced abuse from men in her neighbourhood soon after she began driving in a bid to ease her financial pressures.
""Half of my salary of 4,000 riyals (USD 1,067) was spent on a driver to take me to my workplace and drive my elderly parents,"" Sherif told the pro-government daily Okaz.
""But from the first day of driving I was subjected to insults from men.""
Sherif received an outpouring of support from Saudis on social media, with many posting pictures of her burning vehicle and denouncing the attack as a ""terrorist act"".
Local reports did not say whether her car was insured.
Authorities have sought to show the driving reform had religious approval, with the kingdom's top clerical council emphasising the lifting of the ban was in line with Islamic values.​
But many are still wary of a backlash from hardliners, amid a torrent of sexist comments against women drivers on social media.
Many women say they are staying off the streets, testing reactions in a society torn between conservatism and a modernisation drive launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Some 120,000 women have applied for driving licences, according to an interior ministry spokesman, but it remains unclear how many have been issued.
For now, the women taking to the roads appear mainly to be those who have swapped foreign licences for Saudi ones.",www.asianage.com,2018-07-05 00:18:00,17,236517
"Mumbai : Shriram Transport Finance on Wednesday said that its promoters are in talks with SVL Group to ensure that the latter makes payment of dues to the company on or before the stipulated date.
Shares of the company came under huge selling pressure on Wednesday, plunging nearly 12 per cent, amid concerns over the group’s ability to repay holders of certain debentures. The stock tanked 11.83 per cent to settle at Rs 1,144.85 on BSE. During the day, it tumbled 19.34 per cent to Rs 1,047.20.
Its market valuation also declined Rs 3,482.18 crore to Rs 25,976.82 crore.

It added that in case of failure to do so, it will address the issue “through alternate mechanism to settle the dues.”

"Selayar : Nearly three dozen people have died after a ferry ran aground off the coast of Indonesia, according to an updated official toll on Wednesday, the latest deadly maritime accident in the Southeast Asian archipelago.
The KM Lestari was believed to be carrying nearly 190 people when damage to its hull forced the captain to ground the vessel on Tuesday afternoon about 300 metres (yards) off Selayar island, near the larger island of Sulawesi.
Images from the scene showed terrified passengers clinging to the side of the tipped over ferry, while others floated in the sea awaiting help. Waves swamped the boat’s deck, sweeping trucks and other vehicles on the ferry overboard, as rescuers battled high winds and rough seas to pluck victims from the water.
Indonesia’s disaster agency said 34 people died in the accident while 155 passengers have been rescued, it added. A fleet of smaller boats, including local fishing vessels, worked to save passengers as bad weather prevented larger craft from approaching the stricken ferry, the transportation ministry said.
It added that most passengers had been wearing life jackets. “The captain and ship owner were the last two people to get off the ship,” Agus H Purnomo, a director at the ministry of transportation, said in a statement. The 48-metre (158-foot) vessel was sailing from Sulawesi to nearby Selayar island when strong winds and high waves caused damage to its portside hull and it began taking on water.
The captain deliberately ran the boat aground close to shore in an effort to reduce casualties, the transportation ministry said. Authorities warned that the boat’s owner could face charges. “If the boat was found to be not seaworthy we will take firm action against the operator,” Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi told reporters in Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi.",www.freepressjournal.in,2018-07-05 00:17:24,12,365223

Both come from film families and Ranbir has known Sanju for a long time, so he was already exposed to that life.
Ranbir, was Sanjay Dutt a difficult protagonist to pull off?
Ranbir Kapoor: Yes, there was a major reason I thought it was an impossible feat. How do you already make a biopic on an actor who’s still working in films? His life has been quite amazing, ek bani banayi screenplay mil gayi. I think I started believing that I can do it; then the ball just got rolling.
How did you bridge the gap between the real and reel?
Hirani: In this case, it’s a biopic of an actor whose face is known. The first challenge was how would Ranbir look like him, which I think, was also Ranbir’s immediate fear. And I remember telling him, let’s give it a shot. So we did tons of tests. And finally one day, I was standing there and Ranbir came, and I saw from a distance and I was like yeh mil gaya. And I went almost to hug him and he said just give me 30 seconds, I want to go out and breathe.
Director Rajkumar Hirani Director Rajkumar Hirani
You know Sanjay, you’ve worked with him. But did it feel like, I know this man but I don’t really know him?
Hirani: That happened every day because when his wife Manyata first asked me, why don’t you make a film on Sanjay’s life, my immediate reaction was that’s not my territory. In my head I thought it was going to be a dark film, underworld, and drugs, and I said that’s not my world at all. But as luck would have it, Sanju was out on parole and I went to meet him and in that meeting, I was very curious to figure out how he lived in jail, what he ate, what he did throughout the day. And he told me these crazy stories of how his job was to make paper bags and for every paper bag he made, he would get 25 paisa. The stories that were coming out were so unbelievable. We ended up sitting for 25 days. One day, he spoke about his drinking. He told us the single malt story, when his friend in New York took him to an exclusive single malt club. There they pour one single peg for you and ask you to sip and it and savor it, and you know, all the connoisseurs are there. So then this waiter came and asked, sir what would you like, so he said get us a bottle only yaar. So that guy looked at him and said sir we don’t serve by the bottle. Then he said okay then get me 13 pegs. So these were crazy stories we were hearing.
Ranbir Kapoor Ranbir Kapoor
Ranbir, did you have a method which was different from the other films that you’ve worked on?
Kapoor: I think every film comes with its own method. What I do is I use one perfume for every character. So I went to Sanju sir’s house and got his perfume, because I like getting into the character, his shoes. You know when he walks into a room it’s like a rockstar’s entry. There is a swagger about him, his gait, his long hair, that earring he used to wear with the cross, his sunglasses.
You have also spent time with him?
Kapoor: The Sanjay Dutt I knew was very different from who’s in the film. He, of course, used to pick me up in the middle of the night in his Ferrari for drives. I used to work out in his gym. I remember I was working with Mr (Anurag) Basu on Barfi! and he used to come on the sets, and ask, kaisi picture kar raha hai? Barfi? Iske bad kya karega, ladoo, peda? He used to pull my leg, and always wanted me to play that larger-than-life hero. He treated me like a younger brother. So constantly, you know he is trying to really be a part of my life, really interested in the work I do, and gives me encouragement and constructive criticism.

The Janata Party moved a step further towards a split when the Central Parliamentary Board (CPB) asked Haryana Chief Minister Devi Lal to step down for his refusal to dissociate himself from the July 17 rally. Charan Singh’s followers are organising in the capital in support of the former home minister. The CPB, after listening to the CM, also asked the Janata legislators to elect a new leader in place of Devi Lal on July 7. Devi Lal described the CPB’s decision as unconstitutional but gave no indication whether he would give up the chief ministership. He said he would consult his friends, including Charan Singh, before deciding on the next step.
Charan Singh’s Pose
Charan Singh, former Union home minister, does not intend to attend the meetings of the Janata Party national executive on July 11 or the parliamentary party on July 15. He had resigned from the national executive as well as the parliamentary board while he was in hospital.
Anand Marg Case
A division bench of the Patna high court acquitted Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, supremo of Anand Marg, and four others, accused of murder. The judges allowed the appeal of all five accused against their conviction on the charge of murder of six Anand Marg defectors awarded by the additional district and sessions judge of Patna in November 1976. The CBI had investigated the case following the recovery of bodies from jungles in Ranchi and Singhbum districts in 1970.
UP Janata Rebels
The entire BLD faction in the Janata Party and the UP government have decided to rebel against the central leadership and join the Delhi rally on July 17 as an expression of solidarity with Charan Singh and Raj Narain. Though the CM, Ram Naresh Yadav, was noncommittal about his participation in the rally, a spokesman of the BLD faction said there was no “ifs and buts” about Yadav.

"Kuala Lumpur : Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was charged in court on Wednesday with criminal breach of trust and corruption, two months after a multibillion-dollar graft scandal at a state investment fund led to his shock election defeat.
He pleaded not guilty to all charges. “I claim trial,” he said in a barely audible voice as he stood in the dock at the High Court in Kuala Lumpur.
Prosecutors demanded 4 million ringgit (nearly USD 1 million) bail, but the judge set the amount at 1 million ringgit in cash (USD 250,000) and ordered Najib to surrender his two diplomatic passports. The patrician and luxury-loving Najib, wearing a suit and a red tie, appeared calm and smiled as he was escorted into the court complex. He had been arrested on Tuesday by anti-graft officials over a suspicious transfer of 42 million ringgit (USD 10.4 million) into his bank accounts from SRC International, a former unit of the 1MDB state investment fund that US investigators say was looted of billions by associates of Najib, reports AP. He was charged with abuse of power leading to gratification under Malaysia’s anti-corruption law and three counts of criminal breach of trust. Each charge has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Whipping is also a penalty but Najib would be exempt because of his age.
Najib, 64, has accused Malaysia’s new government of seeking “political vengeance.” In a recorded video posted on social media hours after his arrest, Najib apologised to Malaysians but remained defiant. “As a normal human being, I am not perfect but believe me, that the accusations against me and my family are not all true,” he said.
New Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad reopened investigations into 1MDB that were stifled under Najib’s rule.
Najib set up 1MDB when he took power in 2009 but the fund amassed billions in debts and is being investigated in the US and several other countries.
He and his wife were questioned last month over the SRC case by the anti-graft agency and have were barred from leaving the country.
Police have also seized jewelry and valuables valued at more than 1.1 billion ringgit (USD 272 million) from properties linked to Najib.
US investigators say USD 4.5 billion was stolen and laundered from 1MDB by Najib’s associates, including some USD 700 million that landed in Najib’s bank account.
Najib’s laywer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah asked for the case to be expedited.
Najib “is anxious to clear his name,” he told the High Court. “We are pretty confident about this case.” Bridget Welsh, a Southeast Asia expert at John Cabot University in Rome, said Najib’s arrest was the “inevitable outcome” after he lost power.
“It shows the resolve of the new government to address previous abuses of power. It has been done judiciously so far and speaks to a needed reckoning for Malaysia and a key step toward a cleaner governance,” she said in an email.
Malaysia’s new attorney general, Tommy Thomas, will head the prosecution in the case.",www.freepressjournal.in,2018-07-05 00:16:50,22,364836
"The marvellous attempt in finding the trapped 12 young footballers and their assistant coach inside the cave in Thailand was appreciated by the governor of Chiang Rai province, Narongsak Osottanakorn. He praised the two British cave diving experts, John Volanthen and Richard Stanton, for their dedication in the search operation.
The duo had arrived in Thailand three days after the football team went missing. They are part of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team.
""Both John and Rick (Richard) have been involved in a good number of rescues over the years, and they have both got an awful lot of personal expertise to take to Thailand,"" said Gary Mitchell, chairman of the team.
The pair has also been part of a team in France in 2010, where they attempted to rescue a trapped diver.
Stanton, a retired firefighter from Coventry, became interested in diving after watching a programme called 'Underground Eiger' as a child. He then went on to join caving and diving clubs at the university.
He was once part of rescuing six British cavers in Mexico in 2004. As learnt from the West Midlands Fire Service, during that rescue, Stanton had successfully influenced one member of the group terrified of water to make a 180-meter dive out of the cave. He was awarded an MBE in 2012 in the New Year's Honours List for his cave diving rescue services.
Stanton in one of his interviews shared about the difficulties faced during navigating caves. He said, ""When people landed on the moon they had a map, they knew where they were going but in a cave, if you are beyond the known limit of the cave, nobody knows where it goes, you never know what will happen around the corner.""
A Bristol based IT consultant, John Volanthen grew up in Brighton. His journey of caving started as a scout. In an interview with Sunday Times, he said ""Panic and adrenaline are great in certain situations, but not in cave diving. The last thing you want is any adrenaline whatsoever."" Volanthen runs marathons and ultra-marathons, as mentioned in his online profile.",www.ibtimes.co.in,2018-07-05 00:16:32,18,624529
"Mumbai : ICICI Bank on Wednesday said its mortgage loan portfolio crossed the Rs 1.5-trillion (Rs 1.5 lakh crore) milestone, making it the largest private player in the segment, and the lender is targeting to grow it to Rs 2 trillion by FY20.
At Rs 1.5 trillion, the mortgage loan-book is half of the bank’s overall retail loan portfolio of around Rs 3 trillion, the bank said.
“We are not only the largest private sector bank but also the largest mortgage player among our peers with a Rs 1.5-trillion loan book. And we hope to grow this to Rs 2 trillion, clipping annually at 15 per cent by FY20,” said Anup Bagchi, executive director, ICICI Bank.
He further said mortgage book is half of its Rs 3 trillion retail assets, which constitute 52 per cent of its total assets of $172.5 billion.
ICICI Bank has been under probe by multiple central agencies since March for alleged wrongdoings in extending loan to now-bankrupt Videocon group by its managing director Chanda Kochhar, who has since been asked to go on leave till a probe is over.
Basing his optimism of clocking higher growth on the PM’s Awas Yojna, Bagchi said most of the growth is coming in from tier II and III towns as the average ticket size is only a tad above Rs 30 lakh. When asked about the assets quality, he said there is nothing to worry on this front, and without quantifying claimed it to be one of the lowest in the industry.
“In fact, our mortgage portfolio, which includes loan against property (LAP) also, is has very low credit cost,” he said.",www.freepressjournal.in,2018-07-05 00:16:05,9,365084

"New York : The Plaza Hotel, one of New York’s most iconic buildings in which Subrata Roy-led Sahara India group has majority stakes, has been fully acquired by a Qatar government-owned fund for about $600 million, according to a media report on Wednesday.
Qatar’s state-owned Katara Holding has acquired full ownership of the hotel, including a 75 per cent stake from Subrata Roy-led Sahara India Pariwar for about $600 million, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The “surprise buyer” is a hospitality fund that buys and manages hotels around the world for the Qatar government. Katara bought the 75 per cent stake held by the Sahara Group and the 25 per cent stake from New York real-estate investor Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp. and its partner Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, it said.
There was no immediate comments available from the Sahara Group. The deal, which closed on Monday, includes 282 guest rooms and the property’s retail space, people familiar with the transaction were quoted as saying in the report.
Qatar is the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas. It already owns landmark hotels such as The Savoy and The Connaught in London. US President Donald Trump, who once compared it to the Mona Lisa, and hotelier Conrad Hilton were previous owners of one of the most iconic landmarks in New York City.
Trump lost the hotel in a bankruptcy. The Plaza Hotel, opened in 1907, is the only hotel listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The report said Katara’s purchase marks the latest twist in a long-running global saga surrounding the Plaza Hotel’s ownership.
In April, a group of investors led by founder of Dubai-based White City Ventures Shahal Khan and Kamran Hakim of the Hakim Organisation, a large private New York landlord, had reached a deal to buy the property. But about a week later, Ashkenazy and Prince al-Waleed exercised a right as minority owners to match any agreement to purchase Sahara’s majority stake.",www.freepressjournal.in,2018-07-05 00:15:47,14,364675

"Riyadh : Saudi police are hunting for arsonists who torched a woman’s car, only a week after the kingdom lifted a decades-long ban on female motorists.
Salma al-Sherif, a 31-year-old cashier based near the holy city of Mecca, told local media that her car had been deliberately set alight this week by men “opposed to women drivers”.
“The incident is being investigated by security officials,” Mecca police said late on Monday by local authorities. “We are searching for the culprits.”
On June 24, women celebrated taking the wheel for the first time in decades as the ultra-conservative kingdom overturned the world’s only ban on female drivers. For decades, arch-conservatives justified the ban saying that allowing female motorists would promote gender mixing and promiscuity.
Sherif said she faced abuse from men in her neighbourhood soon after she began driving in a bid to ease her financial pressures. “Half of my salary of 4,000 riyals ($1,067) was spent on a driver to take me to my workplace and drive my elderly parents,” Sherif told the pro-government daily Okaz. “But from the first day of driving I was subjected to insults from men.” Sherif received an outpouring of support from Saudis on social media, with many posting pictures of her burning vehicle and denouncing the attack as a “terrorist act”.

"Washington : The Trump Administration has rescinded the Obama-era guidelines that encouraged American schools, colleges and institutes of higher education to use race and ethnicity as a factor in the admissions process to promote diversity among students, triggering widespread criticism.
The guidelines were among 24 policy documents revoked on Tuesday by the US Justice Department for being “unnecessary, outdated, inconsistent with existing law, or otherwise improper.”
“In the Trump administration, we are restoring the rule of law,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, alleging that in previous administrations agencies often tried to impose new rules on American people without any public notice or comment period, simply by sending a letter or posting a guidance document on a website. “That’s wrong, and it’s not good government,” he argued. “That’s why in November I banned this practice at the Department and we began rescinding guidance documents that were issued improperly or that were simply inconsistent with current law,” Sessions said. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said that the Supreme Court has determined what affirmative-action policies were constitutional, and the court’s written decisions were the best guide for navigating this complex issue.
The move has been slammed by the opposition Democratic party and rights groups. Anurima Bargava, who headed civil-rights enforcement in schools under Obama’s Justice Department and helped craft the Obama-era documents, told Wall Street Journal that said they simply offered guidelines to schools and colleges looking to continue using affirmative action legally. “The law on this hasn’t changed, and the Supreme Court has twice ruled reaffirming the importance of diversity. This is a purely political attack that benefits nobody,” Bhargava was quoted as saying. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said that the Obama Administration’s guidance reaffirmed the truth that diversity is the strength of schools and nation, which is now under direct attack from the Trump Administration’s discriminatory agenda.
“From day one, Secretary DeVos, Attorney General Sessions and the (Donald) Trump Cabinet have trampled over settled law in their haste to undermine decades of progress toward ensuring that our schools and workforce reflect the diversity of our nation,” Pelosi said.
Senator Patty Murray alleged that with this latest action, the Trump Administration is making it more difficult for colleges and universities to open up doors of opportunity to students and communities who have historically been left behind, and more difficult for them to increase access and diversity in their classrooms, which helps all students succeed.
“This shouldn’t shock anyone who has been paying attention to what President Trump has said about immigrants, women, people of colour, and people with disabilities, or to anyone who has watched what he and Secretary DeVos have done to roll back civil rights enforcement on behalf of survivors of sexual assault, LGBTQ students, and more – but it should be one more reminder that his Administration is doing everything they can, every day and at every level, to divide communities and undermine our American values,” Murray said.
Congressman Bobby Scott, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and Congressman Jerrold Nadler, ranking member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, said that the decision contradicts the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Fisher versus University of Texas case that schools have a compelling interest in pursuing a diverse student body.
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that among the guidance rescinded was information on federal protections based on national origin, laws preventing someone from being denied opportunity based on their ethnic or cultural background.
“This move from Attorney General Sessions is a concrete signal that there is a war being waged on civil liberties from the highest levels of government. Guidance documents do not make law, but they do clarify and facilitate the law’s implementation,” ACLU national political director Faiz Shakir said.
“This is another attack by Sessions and President Trump on people of colour…” he added.",www.freepressjournal.in,2018-07-05 00:14:52,18,364391
"Swaminarayan School in London has been popular within Indian-origin communities.
Thousands of people have signed a petition to prevent the closure of one of the UK's largest independent Hindu faith schools, the Swaminarayan School in London.
The Akshar Educational Trust, which runs the school set up in 1992, had announced its closure last month as part of plans to exit the education sector completely by July 2020.
Parents of students associated with the school have now organised a campaign to save the ""school of excellence"" from closure.
""In a letter to parents, a spokesperson for the school blamed 'increasing regulatory requirements, difficulties in recruitment and retention of teachers, ready availability of free state-funded Hindu schools, and declining pupil numbers' for the move. This is simply not true,"" notes the Change.org petition, which has attracted nearly 3,500 signatures since last week.
""Sensitivity analysis of accounts by experts suggests that with restructuring it is possible for school to run for the foreseeable future,"" it notes.
The parents, who have coordinated into a save-the-school campaign, say that many Indian-origin families have moved, relocated and changed their way of life to enable their children to get an education within the ethos and culture of Hinduism at the respected Swaminarayan School in Neasden, north-west London.
""Parents are more than happy to consider taking over the running of the school by appointing new teams who will give due consideration to the communities and families that are being disrupted by this announcement,"" the parents said in a statement.
The school has been very popular within the large Indian-origin community based in the borough of Brent, many of whom are happy to pay the GBP 4,310 per-term fees to enrol their children. But the trust running it said that mounting pressures in recent years had hampered its ability to invest in the resources required to sustain the improvements needed in the school, both educationally and for its infrastructure.
The institution, opened by Pramukh Swami Maharaj alongside the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir to ""promote Hindu and British culture and values and way of life"", has around 400 pupils between the ages of three and 18 currently on its rolls.
The trustees had unveiled plans for closure in two phases in order to allow parents time to apply to other schools. However, parents are furious at the lack of consultation before the announcement was made.
""The school is not a business, where a decision like this can just be made and announced... the team of governors and trustees just seem to have had enough and this is now the easiest option for them,"" the parents said.
They have received the backing of Indian-origin Labour party MP, Seema Malhotra, who said she is ""saddened"" by the news of the closure.
""The Swaminarayan School has a strong reputation and has been highly valued by parents and the community. I hope that through discussions between parents, teachers, governors and trustees that a solution can be found and the school is able to stay open and continue to flourish,"" she said.
Under the UK's educational system, privately-run faith schools must follow a national curriculum but can have a particular religious character or formal links with a religious organisation. They are allowed to have different admissions criteria and staffing policies from state-funded schools.",www.ndtv.com,2018-07-05 00:14:44,20,642783
"New Delhi :The government has decided to “wait and watch” for the next three-four months before taking a call on disinvestment of national carrier Air India due to prevalent market condition specially high fuel prices, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday.

"Mae Sai (Thailand) : Pheeraphat Sompiengjai’s family still have a birthday cake in the fridge waiting for his return home, as the discovery of the missing boy and his football team in a Thai cave brings joy to relatives but despair at the long rescue ahead. Grilled pork and dessert had been prepared as a post-football birthday treat for Pheeraphat — known by his nickname ‘Night’ — who turned 16 on June 23. Night’s relatives waited that evening to celebrate his birthday — his 17th by Thai tradition. But he did not come home.
Instead Night, his 11 teammates and their 25-year-old coach made the ill-fated decision to walk into the Tham Luang cave after training. The boys chipped in to buy snacks to take down to the cave to mark his birthday, relatives at Night’s village of Vieng Hom said on Wednesday.
They speculated it was those snacks that sustained them during the nine-day ordeal before they were found late Monday huddled in the dark on a muddy bank, flood waters ominously beneath them.
It was meant to be very different, says Night’s sister Phunphatsa. “We prepared dinner to celebrate and some relatives came to join.” “The cake is in the fridge. I kept it there to surprise him.”
As the hours passed they knew something was wrong, in a tight-knit community now wracked by anxiety for the boys’ return. “He never missed any time he was supposed to be home,” his sister told AFP. As the rescue mission drew a blank for days, the family kept the cake because “we still had hope” he would be found alive, Phunphatsa added.
Their village, abutted by rice fields and framed by Northern Thailand’s dramatic mountains, is also home to three of the other boys trapped in the cave. The group still languish inside the cave’s 10 kilometre-long passages, with floods blocking their exit, but are now under the care of Thai navy divers and medics. But fresh rains are forecast and a complex evacuation lies ahead.
The distress was eased a little on Wednesday, when fresh video released by the navy showed the team smiling and looking markedly healthier than when they were found two days ago.
“He said: ‘Hello, I am Night. I’m fine.'” Night’s mother Supaluk told AFP. “It’s very good to see he is safe. I know he will be okay.”

Chakrabarty, a London-based NRI, was stopped at the Mumbai airport by the immigration authorities in May this year, based on the LoC issued against him by the CBI. He has been in the country since then.
LoC bars an individual from leaving the country. According to CBI officials, Chakrabarty, who was questioned by the agency in connection with the case in April, might not return if he was allowed to leave the country. In a letter to the CBI last month, Chakrabarty, who served as the deputy governor of RBI between 2009 and 2014, sought withdrawal of the LoC so that he could return to London.

Wikipedia went down in at least three countries Wednesday in a protest at an upcoming European Parliament vote on a highly disputed law that could make online platforms legally liable for copyrighted material put on the web by users.
In Spain, Italy and Poland, an explanatory protest statement about the upcoming vote came up when the online encyclopedia was consulted.
""The directive would threaten online freedom and would impose new filters, barriers and restrictions to access the web,"" Wikipedia Spain said in its statement.
""If the proposal was approved in its actual version, actions like sharing news on social networks or accessing news via a search engine would be more complicated on the Internet.""
It added that Wikipedia would be ""at risk"" and asked users to phone their MEPs.
The overhaul of European copyright law is divided into several sections, one of which is the reform criticised by Wikipedia and others who have warned it will lead to blanket censorship by tech giants.
Another reform would force online platforms such as Google and Facebook to pay for links to news content, which news agencies including AFP have hailed as a ""major step"".
The European Commission has replied saying that ""Wikipedia and other online encyclopaedias would not fall within the scope of the Commission's Copyright proposal.""
But Wikipedia chief Jimmy Wales and Greens MEP Julia Reda, a leading campaigner on the issue, insist that it will.
Thursday's parliament vote is not final, but only sets out the negotiating position of MEPs.
There then follow negotiations with member states for a final position, during which the full extent of the law and whether it does apply to Wikipedia will be worked out.
Austria, which has just assumed the EU's six-month rotating presidency, has said this will be difficult, so there will have to be some sort of compromise.",www.pulse.ng,2018-07-05 00:11:00,12,239844

"In the letter dated July 2, the board issued this directive to all principal chief engineers across zones.
Just a day before the collapse of a road over-bridge in Mumbai’s Andheri, the railway board issued a letter to senior zonal engineers directing that all its bridges be inspected regularly till they are put to use, and not just after they are commissioned, as is the norm currently.
In the letter dated July 2, the board issued this directive to all principal chief engineers across zones.
The next day i.e. on July 3, the 40-year-old road over-bridge in Andheri collapsed on railway track injuring five people and disrupting rail services.
A railway board official said, the letter was issued today, a day after the collapse, but that it has nothing to do with the incident. However, the letter carries the date as July 2.
“As per existing practice, new bridges/ROBs constructed on new lines, doubling/gauge conversion are inspected after commissioning of the line/bridge only. It is observed that in some cases, there is large time gap in completion of a bridge and its commissioning and during this intervening period bridge is not being inspected. This may have implication on safety…
“All ROBs constructed on new lines, doubling, gauge conversion should be inspected (regularly) till its commissioning…all ROBs on existing lines should be inspected even before commissioning of the bridge,” the order stated, adding that all bridges over railways should be inspected as per schedule laid down under the railways’ bridge manual.
According to railway officials, all bridges are currently inspected at least twice a year, once before monsoon, and once after.
The bridge connecting Andheri East to West in Mumbai collapsed yesterday barely seven months after it was last inspected.
Railway Minister Piyush Goyal had visited the accident site and ordered an inquiry by the Commissioner of Rail Safety.
He had also said that during the next six months, a joint safety audit will be conducted by the Railways, the Mumbai’s municipal body and the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, at the 445 road over-bridges, foot over-bridges and bridges over pipelines in the city as part of efforts to improve safety.
The railways had a total of 1,47,523 bridges in the country, including 2,870 ROBs, 3,422 FOBs, road under-bridges (RUBs) and subways, as of April",www.financialexpress.com,2018-07-05 00:10:33,15,244404

When asked whether they tried to sort out things, Krushna told Spotboye, ""I have been unable to catch hold of him. He went to London after the incident and then he got busy with a film shoot. I seriously want to reconcile with him.""
Krushna Doesn’t Mind His Mami Giving Him Gaalis!
He added, ""I don't mind if my mami gives 5-6 gaalis, it's her right to do so. I have said this in the earlier interview also, I have stayed with her as a kid and she has taken utmost care of me. So I understand that she might be feeling more hurt. Knowingly, or unknowingly, I got dragged into the matter. After which unknowingly I also got involved.""
Kashmira’s Timing Was Off!
The actor-comedian further added, ""What Kashmira wrote on Twitter irked Sunita mami, but the fact is that Kashmira wrote it for my sister, not mami. The timing was off!""
‘Kashmira Is At Major Fault Here & She Should Apologise To Mami’
""Yeh Kashmira se galti ho gayi. Kissi ke bhi bare main Twitter par nahi likhna chahiye tha. She could have avoided it. Kashmira is at major fault here and she should apologise to mami, as my mami (Sunita) has been taking care of the whole family.""

"Cristiano Ronaldo currently plays for Real Madrid in La Liga. (Reuters Photo) Cristiano Ronaldo currently plays for Real Madrid in La Liga. (Reuters Photo)
Cristiano Ronaldo has received an offer to leave Real Madrid and join Italian champions Juventus, a source close to the player told Reuters on Wednesday.
Ronaldo, who joined Real from Manchester United in 2008 for a then world record 80 million pounds ($105.65 million), is the Spanish club’s all-time top scorer with 451 goals in all competitions and has won two La Liga titles and four Champions League trophies with them.
Despite the glut of silverware, however, the five-times world player of the year has had frequent fallouts with Real and has declared on several occasions that he wants to leave the club.
Moments after lifting a third consecutive Champions League trophy by helping beat Liverpool 3-1 in the final on May 26, Ronaldo appeared to suggest he had already decided to leave Real, telling a television reporter on the pitch at Kiev’s NSC Olympic Stadium: “It was beautiful to play for Real Madrid.”
Ronaldo, 33, appeared to backtrack on that statement during Real’s celebration parade through the Spanish capital the next day, when he told a mass of supporters: “See you next season.”
The Portugal forward was reported to be on the verge of leaving last June after a news story appeared in Portuguese newspaper Record declaring he was unhappy with the club.
He also caused a stir in 2012 when he declared in a post-match interview after a game with Granada: “I’m sad and the club know why.”
Juventus declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, while Real Madrid said: “Our official comments are made through our official media channels.”
Real have not issued any statement on their website about Ronaldo, although in the past days they have issued statements denying reports they have made transfer bids for Paris St Germain forwards Neymar and Kylian Mbappe.
Spanish newspaper Marca suggested on Wednesday that Ronaldo is unhappy at Real because they are searching for his successor and president Florentino Perez has publicly courted Neymar, urging the Brazilian last year to come to Madrid if he wants to win the prestigious Ballon d’Or award.
Ronaldo scored two goals against Juventus in Real’s 4-1 win in the 2017 Champions League final and earlier this season struck a jaw-dropping bicycle kick against the Italians in a 3-0 win in a quarter-final first-leg game in Turin which prompted Juve supporters to give him a standing ovation.
The Portuguese converted a stoppage-time penalty in the second leg to knock the Italians out 4-3 on aggregate.
Ronaldo enjoyed an explosive start to the 2018 World Cup by scoring a hat-trick in his side’s 3-3 draw with Spain, also hitting Portugal’s winner in a 1-0 win over Morocco. But he missed a penalty in a 1-1 draw with Iran and failed to score in his side’s 2-1 defeat by Uruguay in the last 16.

TOLL ROAD operator NLEX Corp. looks to brave the bond market anew by the fourth quarter of 2018 to finance the construction of the North Luzon Expressway — South Luzon Expressway (NLEX-SLEX) Connector Road.
“Hopefully by the latter half of this year, we will go back to the public bond market and raise bigger amounts of money. This time to fund what we call a game changer, this is the NLEX Connector Road which will start construction next year,” NLEX Corp. President and Chief Executive Officer Rodrigo E. Franco said at the listing ceremony of the first tranche of its shelf-registered bonds yesterday.
The unit of Metro Pacific Tollways Corp. (MPTC) needs financing for P16 billion out of the NLEX-SLEX Connector Road’s total project cost of P23 billion. Of this, 30% will be funded through equity and 70% will be through a combination of bonds or bank loans.
“Around P11-12 billion (from banks or bonds). We may do it in tranches. Construction is done over time. The bonds, we have to program it,” Mr. Franco told reporters after the listing ceremony.
The remaining P7 billion of the project cost will be spent for right-of-way acquisition, which Mr. Franco said can be paid over time.
The NLEX-SLEX Connector Road is an eight-kilometer elevated highway extending the NLEX southward from Segment 10 in C3 Road Caloocan City to the Polytechnic University of the Philippines in Sta. Mesa Manila, and also connecting the common point of Skyway Stage 3.
The highway is set to reduce travel time from Clark, Pampanga to Calamba, Laguna from three hours to one hour and 40 minutes, with expected usage of at least 35,000 vehicles per day.
Meanwhile, the company on Wednesday raised P6 billion from the issuance of Series A bonds due 2025 with a coupon rate of 6.6407% per annum and Series B bonds due 2028 carrying an interest of 6.9% per year.
The funds raised from the first tranche of the P25-billion bonds under shelf registration will be used to finance the company’s R-10 Section Project, a 2.6-kilometer elevated toll road set to extend the C-3 Road exit ramp of Segment 10 to R-10 Road near the Port Area.
NLEX Corp. started construction for the R-10 project last month, and is scheduled to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2019.
The issuance is the 11th listing at the Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. (PDEx) for the year, bringing the total new listings for the year to P88.81 billion.
With this, the Metro Pacific group now has a total of P31.5 billion worth of listed bonds in the PDEx, comprising 3.58% of the total outstanding face amount of P881-billion corporate bonds enrolled at the fixed income exchange.",bworldonline.com,2018-07-05 00:09:45,18,118000
"The 44-floor Cosmopolitan apartment tower in the heart of Warsaw houses many elites (AFP)
A grey Ferrari comes to a halt in Warsaw and a young woman emerges. Wearing Chanel sunglasses and carrying a little dog, she enters the Raffles Europejski hotel, a symbol of the luxury that has returned to Poland.
Her destination is the historic pastry shop Lourse, which is located at the hotel, where guests pay between 250 and 4,000 euros ($290 and $4,700) a night and can count on perks like a personal butler.
The legendary Hotel Europejski, which was considered eastern Europe's best in the 19th century, has just reopened after five years of renovation work spearheaded by the Raffles brand.
Poland's first Hermes store could be housed at the site, a source told AFP, though the French luxury goods giant would only confirm that it was looking into a project ""in Warsaw in late 2019, early 2020"".
Luxury has become increasingly visible in Poland after a long absence due to the country's devastating losses during World War II and the policy of egalitarianism later touted by the communist regime.
Decades on, a new class of wealthy Poles has appeared, whose members include heads of successful family businesses, real estate agents and high-flying bankers.
Many of the elite live in the 44-floor Cosmopolitan apartment tower in the heart of Warsaw. Opened in 2014, the building boasts a minimalist design by German-American architect Helmut Jahn, who also designed the European Union's headquarters in Brussels.
Of the 100 most expensive real-estate sales in Warsaw between 2015 and 2017, 79 concerned flats in the Cosmopolitan building, said Karolina Kaim, president of Tacit Investment, the Polish firm that financed the building's construction.
'Vertical village'
The apartments vary in price depending on the floor and view.
The most sought after units look out onto the Vistula River and the old part of town and cost nearly 10,000 euros per square metre -- a figure that may not shock Parisians or Londoners but is staggering to the average Pole who earns around 1,100 euros a month.
Most of the apartment owners are Polish but there are also a handful of foreigners living in the ""vertical village"", which cost more than 100 million euros to build, according to Kaim.
Residents include pop stars, football players and actors.
Other luxury symbols seen around town include high-end cars from brands such as Bentley, Ferrari, Lamborghini and Rolls-Royce.
Only a few years ago, the appearance of a sports car with the famous horse logo would have drawn a small crowd of onlookers, but today, Ferraris no longer stop traffic in Warsaw.
The Italian luxury car manufacturer has two Polish dealerships, one in the southern city of Katowice and another in the capital.
Their marketing head Karolina Szulecka prefers not to reveal sales figures but says that client interest is constantly on the rise.
Were it not for the company's policy of limiting production, Poles would snap up ""10 or 15 percent more"" Ferraris, she told AFP.
On the rise
From the collapse of communism, a new social group of entrepreneurs rapidly emerged, often former managers quick to buy shares in the newly privatised companies and develop them, or small entrepreneurs and artisans who swiftly adapted to the new conditions to create or grow a family business.
EU funds and foreign investment into the country followed and increased after Poland's 2004 EU entry.
Between 1990 and 2015, gross domestic product (GDP) more than doubled. Exports are growing and, according to International Monetary Fund forecasts, growth is expected to be just over four percent this year partly on ""strong domestic consumption"".
Today, Poland's wealthiest are often the third generation of those small business owners.
A dozen Ferraris
Meanwhile some Poles have many more than just one sports car.
A land developer, who declined to be identified, admitted he had three Ferraris parked in his garage, while the brand's biggest collector in Poland has 12. He also prefers to remain anonymous.
The general manager of the Bentley and Lamborghini dealerships in Poland, Piotr Jedrach, expects to sell around 50 British limousines in 2018 -- an increase on previous years thanks in part to the recent addition of an SUV model.
Prices start at around 230,000 euros.
As for Lamborghinis, displayed in Warsaw in a car dealership that looks more like a futuristic temple, they too are forecast to see a boost in sales, with 60 expected to sell in 2019, thanks to the SUV Urus.
The average Pole has nothing against the ultra wealthy.
""If I had that much money, I'd also buy myself a Ferrari,"" said Hanna Mrowiec, a retired middle manager who lives in a small one-bedroom apartment.
""But to have three? That's absurd. You can't drive three Ferraris at once,"" she told AFP.
Nevertheless, luxury in Poland generally remains discreet, more the purview of cultural sponsorship than bling-bling excess.
The Swiss owner of Raffles Europejski, Vera Michalski, paid for around 500 modern Polish works of art to adorn her hotel. She also lent some from her own collection.
As for the Cosmopolitan, there was an art exhibition earlier this year on the 42nd floor.
It featured work by the late painter and sculptor Wojciech Fangor, the only Pole to ever have a solo exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York.
The Cosmopolitan exhibition was free for anyone to attend -- not just the happy few living there.",www.ndtv.com,2018-07-05 00:09:38,41,643672
"London: Roger Federer extended his flawless winning streak at Wimbledon to 26 consecutive sets as the defending champion crushed Lukas Lacko, while Serena Williams powered to her 16th successive win in Wednesday's second round action.
While Federer and Serena strolled, Caroline Wozniacki suffered fresh Wimbledon woe as the world number two suffered a shock 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 defeat against Ekaterina Makarova.
Federer delivered a Centre Court masterclass lasting 89 minutes as the Swiss star hit 48 winners and 16 aces in his 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 victory.
The 36-year-old is now on his joint second longest streak of sets won at Wimbledon — his best was 34 between the third round in 2005 to the 2006 final.
Next up for Federer is a third round tie against German world number 64 Jan-Lennard Struff who came back from two sets down to defeat 39-year-old Ivo Karlovic 13-11 in the final set.
In his 20th Wimbledon appearance, top seed Federer, a 20-time major winner, is bidding to become only the second player to claim nine singles titles at the All England Club after Martina Navratilova.
On the evidence of his ruthless demolition of Slovakian world number 73 Lacko, it will take something special to stop Federer making more Wimbledon history.
""I played very well. I felt good out there, less nerves than in the first round,"" Federer said.
""I'm happy how I am hitting the ball, good concentration on my service games and able to mix it up with some slices.
""Of course, you sometimes play the percentages, but if you do that too much it becomes boring, so I like to mix it up.""
Federer wasn't the only former champion in peak form on Centre Court as seven-time winner Serena routed Bulgarian qualifier Viktoriya Tomova 6-1, 6-4.
Williams brushed aside Tomova in just 66 minutes with 24 winners and four aces to extend her streak of consecutive match wins at the All England Club.
""It was better than the first round. I'm happy I'm going in the right direction,"" Serena said.
""I'm getting there. I expect to get there, not only for Wimbledon but for the tournaments in the future.""
'Eating bugs'
The 36-year-old, whose winning run encompasses her Wimbledon titles in 2015 and 2016, missed the grass-court Grand Slam last year while she prepared to give birth to daughter Alexis Olympia in September.
Serena, seeded 25th after her return from maternity leave, faces France's Kristina Mladenovic or Germany's Tatjana Maria for a place in the last 16.
Wozniacki, plagued by an invasion of flying ants during the Court One clash, saved five match points but has now failed to get past the last 16 in 12 visits to the All England Club.
It was a bitter defeat for the 27-year-old Dane, who was expected to challenge for the Wimbledon title after winning her maiden Grand Slam crown at the Australian Open in January.
With flying ants stuck in Wozniacki's hair and dive-bombing her throughout the match, the former world number one asked the umpire if there was something that could be sprayed to keep the bugs away.
""They're in my mouth and in my hair and everywhere — we need to do something. Is there a spray?"" she said.
""I want to be here to focus on tennis, not eating bugs.""
Five-time champion Venus Williams battled into the third round with a 4-6, 6-0, 6-1 win over Romanian qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru.
Venus reached her ninth Wimbledon final last year, but the American star was denied a sixth title by Garbine Muguruza.
Making her 21st Wimbledon appearance, 38-year-old Venus is the oldest woman in this year's tournament.
But she didn't look her age in making it 89 career match wins at Wimbledon by demolishing Dulgheru in the final two sets.
Asked if her wealth of Wimbledon experience was a key factor, Venus said: ""I'd love to have that extra advantage. If that's working for me I'm all for it.
""It's just about winning the match. If that's your best or not doesn't matter.""
Venus next faces Dutch 20th seed Kiki Bertens, who beat Russian world number 107 Anna Blinkova 6-4, 6-0.
Former world number one Karolina Pliskova finally made it to the third round on her seventh visit to Wimbledon after seeing off two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka 6-3, 6-3.
Former Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwanska lost 7-5, 6-4 to Czech world number 66 Lucie Safarova.",www.firstpost.com,2018-07-05 00:08:59,37,195553
"The order is actually a reiteration of a directive issued by the court in its 2006 verdict in Prakash Singh vs Union of India. The order is actually a reiteration of a directive issued by the court in its 2006 verdict in Prakash Singh vs Union of India.
By giving the Union Public Services Commission (UPSC) a say in the appointment of Director General of Police (DGP) in states, the Supreme Court has taken a simplistic approach to the vexed issue of police reforms. On Tuesday, the Court asked the states to notify the UPSC at least three months before the post of DGP falls vacant and appoint the officer from a panel drawn up by the Commission. The order is actually a reiteration of a directive issued by the court in its 2006 verdict in Prakash Singh vs Union of India. That verdict had taken a nuanced approach to a gamut of issues related to the autonomy of the police force. However, by vesting in the UPSC the power of empaneling DGPs, the apex court transgressed into the rights of states. Tuesday’s directive perpetuates this original sin.
That said, the states cannot be absolved of tardiness in implementing the Prakash Singh verdict. The judgment enjoined every state to constitute a State Security Commission (SSC) “to ensure that the state government does not exercise unwarranted influence or pressure on the state police”. But 12 years after the landmark verdict, less than 20 states have incorporated this directive in full conformity with the apex court’s scheme. The verdict had also asked for the constitution of state-level Police Establishment Boards (PEB) to decide all transfers, postings, promotions and other service-related matters for officers of and below the rank of superintendent of police. In April, a report by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative noted that “while all states have constituted the PEB on paper, only Arunachal Pradesh complies with the directive fully”.
In September last year, the SC started hearing a clutch of pleas claiming that states and union territories have not implemented its 2006 verdict. Here, then, was a chance for the apex court to remove a glitch from its 2006 judgment — course correct like it has done on more than one occasion in the last year. And indeed, there can be no argument against the first part of its directive, which asks states to ensure that a DGP is appointed “through a merit-based transparent process”. But by reiterating that the UPSC is the custodian of this process, the SC has not only lost an opportunity to improve a landmark verdict, it has not furthered the cause of autonomy for the police forces.

THE LOCAL franchise industry is confident of breaching the P1-trillion revenue mark this year as it aggressively positions the Philippines as the “franchise hub of Asia.”
“In 2017, the contribution of the franchise sector is $18.1 billion or almost P1 trillion,” Philippine Franchise Association (PFA) President Richard V. Sanz said during a press briefing in Makati City on Wednesday.
“Internally, we’re looking at 15 to 20% (growth)… I’m optimistic in a 20% growth” he told reporters separately, when asked for the growth forecast for 2018.
If realized, the sector’s 2018 revenues will reach $21.72 billion or P1.15 trillion.
The growth will be driven by the $3-billion investment it expects to generate solely from the Franchise Asia Philippines 2018 Conference and Expo, touted as Asia’s biggest franchising exhibit. The week-long event, which starts on July 18, expects to draw 60,000 visitors.
However, basing projections on a conservative 10% annual growth, the PFA said revenues will hit $24 billion or roughly P1.3 trillion by 2020.
At present, there are about 2,000 local and international franchise brands in the country, with 200,000 stores and employing 1.2 million.
PFA Chairman Emeritus Samie C. Lim noted the growing foreign investments in the franchising sector, describing the Philippines as “the apple of the eye of foreign brands.”
To further position the Philippines as an international franchise development center, Mr. Sanz laid down the PFA’s agenda for the next two years, with the globalization of homegrown brands as its number one priority.
“We have noticed that a lot of Filipino brands are ripe to be in the global arena. We have more than 50 Filipino brands globally. We want this to increase so this is something we are pushing for,” Mr. Sanz said.
He added PFA is looking to concentrate the expansion within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) due to its close proximity to the Philippines.
Mr. Sanz said the group will also be supporting micro, small, and medium entrepreneurs through mentoring programs and regional trade shows.
“The small and medium agri-businesses, the farmers, can integrate their products into the value chains of the PFA members,” Mr. Sanz added.",bworldonline.com,2018-07-05 00:08:42,14,118038
"FULLY digital screens are replacing speedometers and dials in vehicles, making industry leader Japan Display Inc. (JDI) optimistic about boosting sales to global car makers.
While most new models usually have a center information panel for maps, entertainment and other functions, manufacturers are also increasingly replacing the dashboard facing the driver with a flat screen. Look inside the latest BMW or Mercedes-Benz, chances are Japan Display made the panel.
Replacing instrument clusters with screens is challenging, because they need to be more reliable and withstand swings in temperature, while providing critical information for the driver. That also makes them more expensive and lets display suppliers demand higher margins, making them an attractive enterprise. Japan Display, the world’s biggest supplier of panels in cars, is betting that the shift to electric vehicles will make screens the key selling point for any car as drivers pay more attention to the interior aesthetics of automobiles than what’s under the hood.
“It used to be all about the engine — how many cylinders, how much horse power, the sound of it — but with electric vehicles that’s all gone,” Holder Gerkens, who heads JDI’s automotive business, said in an interview. “How do you create attraction? You can do a lot with displays.”
Digital dashboard also offer advantages for drivers, for example changing the style and amount of information for different driving modes, making maps more prominent when needed. For now, they are mostly used in high-end cars made by Audi, Mercedes-Benz and some supercar manufacturers.
The Japanese company controlled 19% of the $6.7-billion global market for automotive displays last year, according to IHS Markit. LG Display was second with 14%.
Sluggish global smartphone sales, which make up about 80% of revenue, are behind JDI’s bid to increase automotive sales. In addition, Apple, Inc., the company’s biggest customer, is shifting to next-generation organic light-emitting diode displays, which JDI doesn’t produce in mass quantities. Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Display Co. supply most of the world’s OLED screens.
Adoption of OLEDs in cars will probably take longer. Unlike liquid-crystal displays, OLED pixels can glow on their own and do not require a backlight, which makes them thinner and more energy efficient. These are significant advantages when it comes to smartphones, but automakers are likely to be more concerned with OLED’s limited lifetime and considerably higher price, Gerkens said.
Japanese companies were the first in the world to commercialize flat-panel technology, but couldn’t keep up with South Korean and Taiwanese rivals in capital investment and price competition. JDI was created in 2012 in a merger of the troubled screen-making units of Toshiba Corp., Sony Corp., and Hitachi Ltd. JDI embraced a strategy of focusing on higher-quality, smaller-sized screens, which has helped it to gain a key foothold in the car industry.
“We are moving away from flat rectangular shaped displays,” Gerkens said. “The future will be more and more design driven.” — Bloomberg",bworldonline.com,2018-07-05 00:07:48,22,118082
"The political tussle in the capital between the AAP government and Centre (through the LG) turned on the ambiguities of Article 239AA. The political tussle in the capital between the AAP government and Centre (through the LG) turned on the ambiguities of Article 239AA.
In a democratic form of government,” writes Justice D Y Chandrachud in his judgment in Govt of NCT of Delhi v Union of India, “real power must subsist in the elected arms of the State.” The five-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra has, through three concurring judgments, in effect overturned the 2016 verdict of the Delhi High Court. The HC had stated that the Lieutenant Governor was the administrative head of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. The apex court has made two things clear: One, the ultimate legitimacy, and the consequent responsibility to exercise power on behalf of the people, lies with the elected legislature and the council of ministers; two, while Delhi is not a full state, the LG is “bound by the aid and advice” of the Delhi government.
The political tussle in the capital between the AAP government and Centre (through the LG) turned on the ambiguities of Article 239AA, in which the LG is empowered to refer “any matter” to the President on which he has a difference of opinion with the council of ministers. The SC’s clarification that “any matter” cannot be “every matter”, that a sound rationale and attempt at dialogue between the LG and government is essential before involving the Centre, is also a moral exhortation to those holding constitutional office: They must heed the spirit of the country’s founding document and “embrace the collaborative federal structure” it stands for. The Delhi assembly’s right to legislate on matters in the state and concurrent list other than land, police and public order has also been upheld. The Delhi government’s executive powers have been re-affirmed, and while the LG’s office has the right to be informed of all its actions, it cannot function as an alternative government.
For the AAP government, the Centre and its gubernatorial appointees, there is much to take away and implement from the SC’s verdict. The Centre still has sway over crucial areas of Delhi’s administration and Parliament’s legislative writ supersedes that of the Delhi government. Going forward, the combativeness that has been on display in Delhi since 2015 must be abandoned for that much-touted slogan, “cooperative federalism”, to be put into effect. And the rough-and-ready recourse to protests and strikes must give way to mature deliberation and compromise. The AAP must not view this judgment as an endorsement of its belligerence and theatrics. There are also lessons for other LGs: The office of the LG must only assist, and not obstruct, the government. The Supreme Court has stood up for the will of the people and the spirit of the Constitution. Now, it’s for the actors in Delhi’s political drama to abide by its values.

"METRO PACIFIC Tollways Corp. (MPTC) targets to get the greenlight from Indonesian regulators for the conduct of a tender offer in favor of minority shareholders of infrastructure firm PT Nusantara Infrastructure Tbk by August.
“We are filing in Indonesia with their SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission). That will determine the actual timeline. It should be August when we get the final clearance sa Indonesia,” MPTC President and Chief Executive Officer Rodrigo E. Franco told reporters on Wednesday.
The Indonesian counterpart for the SEC is called the Financial Services Authority (FSA).
Mr. Franco said they can determine the timeline for the tender offer once it secures clearance from FSA.
MPTC on Tuesday announced that its unit PT Metro Pacific Tollways Indonesia (MPTI) acquired an additional 4.99% stake in PT Nusantara or 760 million shares. The share purchase brought PT MPTI’s total stake in PT Nusantara to 53.26%, prompting the firm to conduct a mandatory tender offer to its minority stockholders.
PT Nusantara’s minority shareholders collectively own 44.21% of the firm, with the other 2.53% held as treasury shares.
Should all shareholders participate in the tender offer, MPTC would have to pay out 1,421 billion Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) or around P5.29 billion, based on a price of 79 centavos per share.
Mr. Franco said they are currently preparing the funding plan for the offer.
“It’s not yet firm but we have bank facilities also. We’ll look at the response to the tender offer…see how the market will react,” Mr. Franco said.
The MPTC executive said PT Nusantara will likely remain a publicly listed firm even after the tender offer.
PT Nusantara has interests in tollroads, water, energy, port operations, and telecommunications. It operates a total of 34.47 kilometers in toll roads in Indonesia.
MPTC’s investment in the Indonesian firm forms part of its parent Metro Pacific Investment Corp.’s plan to expand into Southeast Asia and create a pan-ASEAN tollway network.
Prior to Indonesia, MPIC already had stakes in Don Muang Tollway Public Company Limited, a major toll road operator in Bangkok, Thailand, and in CII Bridges and Roads, a firm with road and bridges projects in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
Earlier this year, the company said it is looking to close a deal for a tollway project in Malaysia. Mr. Franco, however, declined to comment on the matter.
MPIC is one of three key Philippine units of Hong-Kong based First Pacific Co. Ltd., the others being Philex Mining Corp. and PLDT, Inc. Hastings Holdings, Inc., a unit of PLDT Beneficial Trust Fund subsidiary MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., has a majority stake in BusinessWorld through the Philippine Star Group, which it controls.
Shares in MPIC gained a centavo or 0.21% to close at P4.68 each at the stock exchange on Wednesday. — Arra B. Francia",bworldonline.com,2018-07-05 00:07:40,23,117983
"THREE WORDS come to mind when you’re eating xiao long bao, the Chinese steamed soup dumplings:
1. It’s “delicious.”
2. It must have been “tricky” to make, and
3. It’s “witchcraft,” because how can you encase soup in a delicate dim sum skin?
Bai Nian Tang Bao opened late last month in BGC’s Uptown Parade (near the Valkyrie club complex). Guests were served Three Seafood Fried Noodles, and a variety of fried rice, which, while all good and filling, can be waved away for the Giant Tang Bao. Don’t forget the Shanghai-style fish fillet though, that really is quite good: immersed in a dark sauce, and crispy yet yielding.
Anyway, back to the Giant Tang Bao. Sure, there are other xiao long baos in the menu, which are to be scooped up in a Chinese soup spoon and moistened with black vinegar before being delivered whole into one’s mouth. The Giant Tang Bao, however, comes with a bit of fanfare.
It is as big as a baby’s face, and a server comes and hands you a paper straw, which you poke through the dim sum skin, and you suck the soup out of it. You’re supposed to wait a couple of minutes before starting to suck up the soup though, otherwise, it would be too hot.
This reporter’s verdict? The soup was thick, hot, and had multiple layers of flavor. Abandon the idea of the paper straw, transfer the Giant Tang Bao from the bamboo steamer onto a plate, puncture the skin with a spoon, and let the soup wet the dim sum skin. That, I think, allows for one to enjoy all its flavors.
The multiple flavors come from a long cooking process, which takes about 12 hours. The soup contains pork and crab roe — which is as much as co-owner Paul Li would let on. The crab roe is special, imported from a lake in Shanghai.
“Most of the food, if we can get it locally… for the xiao long bao, there are secret sauces, ingredients, we get those from Shanghai,” said Mr. Li.
The soup is frozen and packed into the dim sum skins, and then steamed at just the right time and temperature so the soup inside heats up, yet not so much as to damage the dim sum skin.
According to legend, xiao long bao appeared on Chinese imperial tables in the 1700s. One of the most famous xiao long bao places is Nanxiang Bun Shop in Shanghai, which moved to government hands after China’s Communist revolution in the 1940s. Bai Nian Tang Bao — bai nian meaning “100 years” according to a release — was founded in 2001, and is a member of Shanghai’s xiao long bao association.
The Philippine franchise of Taiwanese xiao long bao giant Din Tai Fung was a sensation when it first opened a few years ago. Mr. Li said that while xiao long bao has proven to be a fixture in the country, he and his business partner (both fans of the dumpling) noted that the xiao long bao outlets here come from Taiwan and Singapore.
“But xiao long bao, this food, comes from China,” he said, referring to their own version. “The taste, we feel, is different. We want to bring the original taste.” — JLG",bworldonline.com,2018-07-05 00:07:35,29,118054
"AMMAN/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russian air strikes against insurgents in southwest Syria resumed on Wednesday, residents and a war monitor said, after a rebel said talks to restore government rule there peacefully had failed.
The air strikes targeted the towns of Tafas, northwest of the provincial capital Deraa, and Saida, to its east, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is waging a campaign in the southwest with Russian air support to recapture the region from rebel groups, and has seized a large chunk of their territory.
Russian air strikes had paused on Saturday evening, the Observatory said. The Observatory, along with residents and rebels in Saida, said barrel bombs were also dropped on Saida on Wednesday evening.
Rebels have been negotiating with Russia since Saturday, seeking a deal to end fighting by accepting the return of state sovereignty, but they have not been able to agree terms.
""The talks with the Russian enemy in Bosra al-Sham have failed because of their insistence on handing over heavy weapons,"" Abu Shaima, a spokesman of the central operations room representing main Free Syrian Army factions negotiating with the Russians told Reuters.
Another rebel spokesman, Ibrahim al-Jabawi, said the talks did not reach any conclusion. Russia wanted heavy weapons handed over in one go. The opposition wanted to surrender them in stages after tens of thousands of displaced people returned home, he said.
The first round of talks on Saturday prompted rebels to walk out, saying Russian terms amounted to a humiliating surrender. Jordan persuaded them back to the negotiating table, official sources said.
Numerous towns in the southwest had already struck their own surrender deals with the government in the teeth of the army advance and aerial bombardment, independently of the main rebel factions.
Warfare in southwest Syria is sensitive to neighbouring Jordan and Israel. The area is also a ""de-escalation zone"", as agreed by Jordan, the United States and Russia last year to reduce fighting.
Although Washington warned it would respond to violations of the agreement, it has done nothing so far and rebels have said the United States told them to expect no American military help.
Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi held talks in Moscow with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov earlier on Wednesday, and said a humanitarian catastrophe risked unfolding in southern Syria if there were no ceasefire.
Lavrov said all Syria-related issues were likely to be discussed at the coming summit meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The fighting in southwest Syria has caused an estimated 270,000 people to flee their homes, the United Nations said on Monday.

"PARIS (Reuters) - France and Germany will send two men, including an Iranian diplomat, to Belgium to face accusations they were involved in a plot to bomb an Iranian opposition rally on the outskirts of Paris, judicial sources said on Wednesday.
Belgium is already investigating two Belgians of Iranian origin arrested on Saturday, the day of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) meeting. Five hundred grams of the homemade explosive TATP and a detonation device were found in their car.
Iran has said it had nothing to do with the plot, which it called a ""false flag"" operation staged by figures within the opposition group itself.
The exiled Iranian opposition group's meeting was attended by Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who gave a speech calling for the removal of Iran's rulers.
In addition to the two people arrested in Belgium, an Austria-based Iranian diplomat was held in Germany, and a man of Iranian origin was held in France. Judicial authorities in France and Germany told Reuters Belgium had requested they be extradited.
""It's extremely sensitive and the Belgians are taking the lead,"" said one European intelligence source.
During a visit by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to Vienna on Wednesday, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a statement to reporters that Rouhani had assured him that he would work to clarify the case.
French officials have declined to comment on the matter saying the nature of the incident is unclear.
Highlighting the political sensitivities, Iran summoned France's ambassador to protest against the staging of the opposition meeting. Tehran ""strongly protested against the French support of activities of the terrorist organisation,"" referring to an exiled opposition group.
France's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Since the United States withdrew in May from a deal to lift sanctions on Iran in return for curbs to Tehran's nuclear programme, the deal's European signatories Britain, France and Germany have said they want to save the accord. Iran has called on the European countries to offer economic benefits to make up for the damage caused by new U.S. sanctions.
Any suggestion that Iranian authorities were behind the plot in France could make it politically difficult for leaders, especially French President Emmanuel Macron, to continue to back the nuclear deal.
The Austrian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday it was stripping the diplomatic status of the diplomat arrested in Germany. Iran's foreign ministry has rejected as baseless the allegations against the diplomat.

"THE GAMING industry has changed considerably and so did the behavior and the profile of the typical gamer, a new study by PC giant Dell has shown.
An online survey commissioned by Dell’s gaming brand revealed that the habits and attitudes of today’s gamers have changed.
The profile of a gamer, according to the survey, is no longer described as “the stereotypical teen loner playing in his parents’ basement.”
“Gone are the days that being called a ‘gamer’ is derogatory,” the company said in the report. The survey showed that fewer than one in 10 (8-9% each) feel either “judged,” “childish” or “embarrassed” for being called a “gamer.”
The survey respondents also noted the benefits of playing video games, which reaffirmed a research conducted by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Australia which found teens who were regular gamers scored higher than average in math, reading and science on an international exam. Survey respondents said that, because of gaming, they are more strategic thinkers (39%), have improved hand-eye coordination (37%) and increased reaction time (36%). Some even perceive that their teamwork (27%) and leadership (18%) skills have improved.
The more advanced the gamer, the more likely they are to report skill development. Half of gamers at pro level (54%) claimed that gaming has made them more strategic thinkers, while 36% of casual players and 30% of noobs said the same. Similar patterns occur for technology skills: 42% of pros said they are more tech savvy compared to 18% of casual players and only 14% of noobs.
Dell commissioned research firm Researchscape to conduct the online survey among 5,763 video game players from 11 countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, New Zealand, UK and US).
To qualify for the study, respondents had to play videogames on desktops or laptops for at least an hour a week. They did not need to identify as gamers, and 7% said they did not. The survey was fielded from Dec. 9, 2017, to Jan. 30, 2018.",bworldonline.com,2018-07-05 00:06:45,13,118079

MONTREAL/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - China has cooled to a landmark deal to curb emissions from international flights, with the country no longer listed as a participant in the agreement's first phase, according to the United Nations aviation agency's website.
China does not appear on a June 29 list of participants in the voluntary phase of the deal brokered by the International Civil Aviation Organization in 2016, according to ICAO's website.
Aviation powerhouse China was included in previous lists seen by Reuters. It is not clear why China now objects to the deal. The first or pilot phase begins in 2021.
Environmentalists say China's participation is vital for the 2016 Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) deal, which requires airlines to limit their emissions or offset them by buying carbon credits from designated environmental projects around the world.
Europe will press China to remain, after the country recently argued it never agreed to join the first phase, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity about the private talks.
""In the months to come, Europe together with its ICAO partners, will work with China to find ways to address China's concerns without undermining (the deal's) environmental integrity in order to keep this important aviation country on board,"" a European Union source said on Tuesday.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China and ICAO did not respond to requests for comment.
In 2016, China and the United States pledged support for the deal, with both countries saying they expect ""to be early participants.""
A second source said China is likely distancing itself as a negotiating tactic. Talks are expected this fall over which environmental projects will be available to airlines for purchase as offset credits.
China wants its domestic projects to be eligible, the source said.
The United States, which last year announced plans to withdraw from the Paris climate pact, is still in the aviation deal and the Federal Aviation Administration said it would continue to work ""on the implementation of CORSIA.""
Airlines support the agreement as a cheaper alternative to a patchwork of regional deals. Citing ICAO figures, the Air Transport Action Group estimates CORSIA will cost airlines between $1.5 billion and $6.2 billion in 2025, depending on future carbon prices.
""We are disappointed that the Chinese government has decided not to participate in the pilot phase of CORSIA,"" said ATAG executive director Michael Gill in a statement.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany and France have offered Spain ""observer status"" on a programme to develop a new European fighter jet, but want to keep the project as a binational endeavour for now to ensure it moves ahead quickly, according to a German government source.
Spain had sent a letter to its NATO allies asking to participate in the critical industrial undertaking in December, according to the government source and several industry sources.

"In modest societies, lack of economic privilege acts as a direct impediment for sportspersons. (Representational Image) In modest societies, lack of economic privilege acts as a direct impediment for sportspersons. (Representational Image)
The role of society is to encourage human endeavour in all its pursuits. Sports edify this spirit, and the state steps in to help the development of sports. Merely rewarding success does not promote a sporting culture, much like awarding a Nobel Prize does not create an Einstein or a Tagore. We must focus on nurturing sporting temperament over a system of rewards. Infrastructure development, training facilities, dietary improvements are all core aspects that help create an environment for people to better train themselves. This has been the biggest challenge in Indian sports, where governments are keener to offer cash-prizes to Olympic medalists than cultivate Olympians.
In modest societies, lack of economic privilege acts as a direct impediment for sportspersons. Lack of resources compels youthful exuberance to be frittered away in gathering bare sustenance, and the sporting potential is lost. The state’s primary responsibility is to create equality of opportunity where potential can be honed. That is the reason why public employment is promised to performing talent, enabling sportspersons to focus on sports and not the money.
Under the service rules, all employees of the state are barred from undertaking any other occupation or business. Therefore, if an employee wishes to pursue another commercial engagement, then they must forgo the public employment. Conversely, the state has the claim overall proceeds that its employees make during public employment. This provision poses constraints for sportspersons. Ideally, if the service rules are applied, a sportsperson cannot pursue sports during the subsistence of the employment, as it would come at a cost to the office they hold. The state, therefore, makes an exception for them.
It is because the pursuit of sports brings laurels to society and a feeling of national pride that the state treats sportspersons as being on duty while training and taking part in competitions. But, such a relaxation cannot extend to a sportsperson focusing solely on commercial gains. Therefore, as long as the pursuit of sports is national (amateur or non-commercial) it is allowed; but not commercial (professional).
Since sportspersons have a short career expectancy, it was felt that opening up the professional arena would encourage more people to take up sports as a career. Heeding the welfare of sportspersons and the development of sports, the Haryana government decided to allow players to pursue professional competitions, something which was previously disallowed. Because the pursuit of professional competition came at the time and cost to the public office, it was felt that the state should not allow it unfettered.
Therefore, the state as the employer decided to retain a fraction of the profits that the players made while pursuing commercial enterprises as long as they did it as public employees. This wasn’t a “tax” or “penalty” for performing players, but a fair deduction for pursuing commercial gains at the time of the employer. Otherwise, it would be unfair to the employer to have their employees making a profit while not doing their work, and still retaining the benefits. It is in this context that the April 30 notification of the Haryana government must be seen.
The notification allows a sportsperson to keep their public employment and pursue professional sports and commercial endorsements. The sportsperson would be given extraordinary leave (without pay) during the said period and only one-third of the income earned needed to be deposited with the state. Such money would solely be used by the State Sports Council for the development of sports.
The notification was attacked by professional players who saw it as a “tax” on their labour. However, this is far from the truth. Players are free to pursue amateur sports and can hold all incomes from it. But when they pursue commercial work, then they do so not just for the competition, they are lured by the money. Because they earned that money at the benefit of public employment, they have a responsibility to society. They must share their winnings for the development of sports in India. And that is what the notification sought to bring about.
It is not a draconian provision of a state mafia, rather it is an enabling provision that works both to the benefit of the sportsperson and society. The sportsperson can enjoy the security of public employment, and also pursue any commercial enterprise related to sports. The society in turn gets to share their success through a feeling of national pride and contributions from that income. The money that the professional players of today contribute will only go on to help the successive generations of Olympians. The role of the state is of a facilitator, acting in the best interest of everybody.

"The Committee of Administrators (CoA) filed a ninth status report on Wednesday, and made severe remarks against office-bearers of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The committee has listed a series of events where the board office-bearers tried to systematically undermine the CoA and its decisions.
The Supreme Court will resume hearing the BCCI matter on Thursday. A bench comprising Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice DY Chandrachud will hear the matter. The last hearing on the matter was held on 11 May where the court had asked the Amicus Curiae (Gopal Subramanium) to share the suggestions of the draft constitution with all state associations.
However, the CoA, despite the hearing on the horizon, decided to file its status report. According to CricketNext, who gained an access to the report, the CoA highlighted the Special General Meeting held by the working body, claiming it was an attempt to bypass the decisions taken by the committee. The report also accused the the treasurer of hampering the smooth implementation of the Lodha reforms that the Supreme Court passed in an order in 2016.
Reacting to the status report, one of the office-bearers said, “It appears that conjectures have given rise to the narrative of some of the averments of the report rather than facts.”
In the report, the committee also blamed the acting secretary for dilly-dallying with the signing of the player contracts. The contracts were set to expire on 30 September. CoA then prepared a fresh contract and circulated it to the finance committee, but the finance team failed to provide its views till February 2018. The CoA were then forced to announce it keeping in mind the players' welfare but still received no co-operation from the secretary who didn’t sign on the pretext that it had to be approved by the general body.
The above sequences of events led the CoA to believe that the pre-report and pre-judgment processes cannot be relied upon to ensure that management and administration of the board is carried out in a manner contemplated by the report and the judgment.",www.firstpost.com,2018-07-05 00:06:10,13,195062

Syria's southern province of Daraa, one of the last rebel bastions, has been the target of a deadly regime offensive since June 19 which has forced around 300,000 people to flee.
Here is a recap of the main events:
First hits
On June 19, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad bombards rebel-controlled zones in the east of Daraa province, which borders Jordan and the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.
Within three days, more than 12,000 Syrians flee after artillery fire and air raids intensify, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor.
Russian strikes
Russia joins the offensive on June 23, bombing rebel-held parts of southern Syria for the first time since brokering a ceasefire there nearly a year earlier, the Observatory says.
The following day, Jordan says it will not be able to host a new wave of Syrian refugees and that the countries' shared border will remain closed.
The regime ramps up its bombardment of rebel-held parts of provincial capital Daraa on June 25, slamming more than 55 surface-to-surface missiles into the city, followed by four crude barrel bombs.
Russian air strikes also pummel opposition-held neighbourhoods, as well as a military base under rebel control.
Nearly a week into the offensive, at least 29 civilians are dead, according to the Observatory, while the United Nations says some 45,000 people have fled.
Assault on Daraa city
On June 26, the Syrian army launches an assault on Daraa city, targeting several neighbourhoods with air raids and artillery fire.
In New York on June 27, several Western members of the UN Security Council call on Moscow to halt the offensive and ""uphold its commitments"" in southern Syria, where Russia agreed a ceasefire a year before.
The next day is the bloodiest since the start of the assault. A barrage of Russian air strikes kills at least 25 civilians, mostly in the town of Al-Mseifra.
The United Nations announces it has halted cross-border convoys carrying aid from Jordan into southern Syria over security concerns.
Deals and 'divisions'
On June 30, eight battered rebel-held towns in the province return to regime control under Russian-brokered deals.
With these capitulations, regime forces double their territorial control in Daraa to around 60 percent since the offensive began.
Rebels and local officials, meanwhile, hold talks with Russia over a regime takeover of the rest of the province.
But on July 2, the civilian part of the opposition's delegation withdraws from the talks.
The Observatory says there are ""divisions among rebel groups"" over whether to agree to the terms proposed by Russia.
On July 4, rebels say in an online statement the talks have failed ""after they insisted on the surrender of heavy weapons"" in one go.
According to the United Nations, between 270,000 and 330,000 Syrians have fled violence in the province since June 19.",www.pulse.ng,2018-07-05 00:06:00,20,240029
"The victims belonged to the nomadic Nath Gosavi community who move from place to place in Maharashtra in search of food and work.
According to police officials and locals, the victims were first attacked by a group of 'highly inebriated' people in Kakar pada, a village adjoining Rainpada village. (Photo: File | Representational)
Rainpada (Maharashtra): The mob, which beat five tribals to death on Sunday night on suspicion of child lifting, was not satisfied with their killing and wanted the bodies to be burnt on the spot, according to the police.
The victims belonged to the nomadic Nath Gosavi community who move from place to place in Maharashtra in search of food and work.
According to police officials and locals, the victims were first attacked by a group of “highly inebriated” people in Kakar pada, a village adjoining Rainpada village, in Dhule district and were brought to Ranipada while being continuously thrashed along the 1-km stretch.
The tribals had arrived last Saturday night and had planned to go to the police station on Sunday to register themselves.
Whenever this community visits a village, they report to the local police station.
According to videos which were shared on social media, one of the five victims apparently tried to speak to a six-year-old girl after which they were pounced upon, stoned and thrashed with sticks and chappals.
The vicious attack stemmed from rumours on social media which suggested that a gang of child abductors was active in the area.
Police received a distress call at around 11 am on July 1; it took them an hour to reach the spot which is located about 40 kms from the station, assistant police inspector Yogesh Khatkal of Pimpalner police station said.
By then a crowd of about 3,000 people had gathered at site.
“When we reached there, all the five were dead,” he said.
The mob was so worked up that they attempted to physically prevent the police from taking custody of the bodies, said Khatkal, who was one of the five police personnel injured by the mob.
“They wanted the bodies to be burnt there only,” the official said.
Police have arrested 23 people so far.
‘Mob egged on by youths from other villages’
Sakharam Pawar, a former sarpanch of Rainpada, described the sequence of events on the fateful day.
He said that around a dozen people had caught hold of the five persons after they saw them dressed in attires not commonly associated with the Nath Gosavi community.
Nath Gosavi is a nomadic community from Maharashtra. They live on what people offer to them. People from this community not only roam in Maharashtra in search of food and work, but also travel to other states.
“The villagers saw the men, who were dressed in strange attires, offering biscuits to small children. This aroused suspicion that they wanted to kidnap the children,” Pawar said, adding that the men were continuously beaten while being dragged for a kilometre to Ranipada.
Vishwas Gangurde, another villager, said when the five men were brought to Rainpada, the villagers tried to intervene and asked people of the adjoining villages to let them give their version.
“The men were then taken to the panchayat office, where the villagers asked about their antecedents and what they were doing with the children. As they had been thrashed badly, they were only half awake,” he said.
“While they were being questioned, some youth in a highly inebriated state, egged the gathered crowd to not believe what the five men said,” Gangurde added.
“The mob then broke the door and windows of the panchayat office and started thrashing the men, which resulted in their death,” he said.
“None of these drunk youth, who egged the mob to kill the victims, were from Rainpada... Just 2-3 of them were from our village,” he claimed, adding that the Sunday market attracts people from over 20 villages.
Another officer from the police station, requesting anonymity, said five teams have been formed, which are looking for other people involved in this lynching.",www.asianage.com,2018-07-05 00:06:00,29,236429
"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A Swedish court has ordered a bankrupt Arabic internet TV company to pay 210 million Swedish crowns ($24 million) in damages for distributing content including English Premier League soccer without permission.
The Stockholm district court ordered the Sweden-based Advanced TV Network (ATN), which distributes Arabic-language content over the internet, to pay 194.8 million crowns in damages to Qatar’s beIN Sports and 14.6 million crowns to Albanian TV group DigitAlb.
""It is, according to the court's opinion, shown beyond reasonable doubt that ATN at no time ... had the rights to broadcast the beIN channels in question,"" the court said in a verdict dated June 29 and seen by Reuters.
The Stockholm court also sentenced ATN owner Hamid al-Hamid, 58, to two and a half years in prison, while his son Ahmed and another business associate were sentenced to one year each. All three were found guilty of charges including misuse of decoding information and copyright violations.
Hamid al-Hamid's lawyer Johan Nilsson told Reuters that he was working with Ahmed al-Hamid's lawyer and that they planned to appeal the verdict in its entirety.
ATN declared bankruptcy in September 2016, according to the court document. It argued in court that it had distributed the content with the necessary agreements from the content owners, according to the document.
One of the prosecutors in the case, Anneli Tirud Wallin, told Reuters it was her understanding that damages could be extracted from assets belonging ATN or its owners.
Lawyer Jan Gruvstad, who is handling ATN's bankruptcy, told Reuters he could not immediately comment on what ATN was worth or on how soon the bankruptcy procedure would be completed.
Nordic Content Protection, an anti-piracy industry group for Nordic broadcasters which originally filed the case against ATN in 2016, welcomed what it said was a landmark ruling.
""The prison sentences and record fines handed down in this case send a clear message to broadcast pirates,"" the group's chief executive Anders Braf said in a statement.
World soccer governing body FIFA, European soccer body UEFA and Formula One are investigating separate alleged illegal broadcasts of content belonging to beIN, a major global sports broadcaster operating in 33 countries.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian police arrested a senior General Electric Co executive on Wednesday, as part of a sprawling investigation into fraud in medical equipment tenders overseen by health authorities in the state of Rio de Janeiro, police and prosecutors said.
In addition to the arrest of GE's chief executive for Latin America, Daurio Speranzini Jr., prosecutors said federal police were carrying out 21 arrest warrants as part of the investigation, which concerns a trauma institute known as Into and involves some 37 companies.
The investigation, code-named ""Operation Resonance,"" is the latest fraud and corruption probe in Brazil, where the arrest of high-ranking political and business figures has become a matter of routine, particularly in Rio de Janeiro.
Speranzini was previously the head of Philips Medical Systems in Brazil. Frederik Knudsen, who prosecutors said was a sales supervisor at Philips in Brazil during the period under investigation, was also among the people police were seeking to arrest.
In a document sent to a federal court and seen by Reuters, prosecutors said there ""exists robust proof of participation"" by Speranzini and Knudsen in corruption, bid rigging, and criminal conspiracy.
In addition to the arrests, police said they executed 44 search warrants on Wednesday, which included buildings occupied by Philips and U.S. multinational Johnson & Johnson.
A federal court also ordered some 1.2 billion reais ($307 million) in assets to be frozen.
It was not immediately possible to contact Speranzini or Knudsen.
GE said in a statement that with regard to the police operation ""that resulted in the temporary imprisonment of Daurio Speranzini Jr., we clarify that the allegations refer to a period in which the executive was leading a different company.""
It added, ""GE emphasizes that it is not the target of the investigation. The company believes that the facts will be clarified by the courts and the company is at the disposition of the authorities to cooperate.""
Koninklijke Philips NV, as Philips is formally known, said in a statement the company's current leaders were not involved in the police operation and that the firm was cooperating with authorities.
Philips ""still doesn't have access to the official accusations; however, the company is cooperating with the authorities to offer all clarifications regarding the allegations, that go back many years,"" the company said, adding that the ""current head executives of Philips are not part of the federal police operation.""

The battle for police reforms has been going on for the last 22 years. The Supreme Court took 10 years to give a historic judgment in 2006. Since then it has been a struggle to get the Court’s directions implemented. It is a sad commentary on the working of our institutions that the state governments, when it is politically inconvenient, show scant regard to the directions given by the highest court of the land. There are very strong vested interests opposed to any structural changes in the police set-up, which we inherited from the British.
The judiciary is nevertheless to be given credit for pursuing the implementation of its directions on police reforms, even though there have been periods when the matter went into a dark tunnel. On July 3, 2018, responding to an interlocutory application filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Supreme Court gave a slew of directions to ensure that there are no distortions in the appointment of Director General of Police (DGP) of the state. It laid down that the states shall send their proposals three months prior to the retirement of the incumbent DGP; that the UPSC shall prepare a panel of three officers suitable for elevation to the post of DGP; that the state shall appoint one of the persons from the panel only; that there would be no appointments of Acting DGP; that a person appointed as DGP should continue to hold the post for a reasonable period “beyond the date of superannuation”; that the UPSC should as far as practicable empanel officers who have got clear two years of service, giving due weightage to merit and seniority; and that “any legislation/rule framed by any of the states or the Central Government running counter to the direction shall remain in abeyance”.
This detailed clarification became necessary because several states were misusing the apex court’s directions on the point to suit their political calculations. In one state, the DGP was regularised in his assignment hardly an hour before he was due to retire. In another state, the DGP was in acting capacity for more than a year and thereafter regularised, giving him tenure of more than three years. The Supreme Court took cognisance of these aberrations and laid down the ground rules for the states to follow.
The Supreme Court’s intervention is to be lauded. However, the fact remains that this has been the only positive intervention during the last 12 years. During this period, Justice Thomas Committee (2010) expressed its “dismay over the total indifference to the issue of reforms in the functioning of police being exhibited by the states”. Two years later, Justice Verma Committee, which was constituted to examine amendments in Criminal Law in the context of a gang rape incident, had expressed its belief that “if the Supreme Court’s directions in Prakash Singh are implemented, there will be a crucial modernisation of the police to be service oriented for the citizenry in a manner which is efficient, scientific and consistent with human dignity”. Regrettably, there was no follow-up action on either of the above two reports.
The government of India (GoI), meanwhile, came up with the concept of SMART police in 2014 — police that would be strict and sensitive, modern and mobile, alert and accountable, reliable and responsible, tech-savvy and trained. There was, however, no effort by the MHA to make the concept a reality. The states were, of course, unconcerned. Taking a long-term of view of states’ indifference to systemic improvements in police, it is high time that GoI consider bringing police in the “concurrent list” of the Constitution.
The Supreme Court’s intervention on July 3 is a small step forward. There is, however, a long road ahead which has yet to be traversed. States have constituted security commissions, as directed by the Supreme Court, but their composition has been diluted and their charter curtailed. There is an attempt by the Department of Personnel to subvert the Court’s direction regarding police establishment board, apart from the fact that the boards already constituted are not as per the judicial directions. Officers in the field are transferred round the year. There is tardiness in the separation of investigation from law and order functions. The complaints authorities are generally dysfunctional. Apart from these structural changes mandated by the Supreme Court, which have yet to be carried out in letter and spirit, there is need to fill up the huge vacancies in the police and upgrade its infrastructure in terms of housing, transport, communications and forensics.
Achieving all this may sound a tall order, but the tragedy is that the executive has not shown a commitment to police reforms. Our rulers need to understand that development needs solid foundations of good law and order. According to a recent estimate, crime, terrorism and external threats take a huge toll on economic growth and that these cost India 9 per cent of its GDP, which is a very high figure (China lost only 4 per cent, Japan 3 per cent).
If India is to achieve its status as a great power, it is absolutely essential that police is restructured and modernised. Unfortunately, there are politicians who cannot think of surviving without police at their beck and call. There are bureaucrats for whom lording over the police has become an addiction they are not prepared to give up. These vested interests need to be countered by the combined pressure of public opinion, with support from the media and NGOs. The country needs another zamindari abolition with police being freed from the stranglehold of the executive and given functional autonomy to enforce the rule of law. We have had enough of Rulers’ Police, what we need today is People’s Police. The transformation is overdue.

"First, it was his hand. Then, his teeth. Luis Suarez 's feet and football ability are yet to take center stage for Uruguay at a World Cup.Maybe this time, now that his head is right.Like Barcelona teammate and close friend Lionel Messi , Suarez could be playing for his World Cup legacy in Russia. At best he has three games left, starting with Friday's quarterfinal against France.Messi's failures at the World Cup have been well documented. Suarez's experiences have been far rawer.At both his previous tournaments, the Uruguay striker hasn't just left disappointed, he's left in disgrace, labeled a cheat in one and the world's dirtiest player in the other.""You mature, you learn things and you live in the present,"" Suarez said at Uruguay's team base in Russia in the buildup to the France game.In South Africa in 2010, Suarez's defining act was to block a goal-bound header from Ghana with his hand in the dying seconds of extra time in their quarterfinal. Suarez was sent off for the intentional handball but Ghana missed the resulting penalty.Suarez's clear cheating and wild celebrations on the side of the field incensed a continent as it helped Uruguay reach the semifinals at the expense of Africa's last hope.Four years ago in Brazil, there was an even more shocking exit: Suarez bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini in a group game - leaving visible teeth marks in Chiellini's left shoulder - and FIFA banned him for nine matches and four months, ending his tournament. It was the third time Suarez had been banned for biting an opponent.Suarez, now 31, is back for another go at the World Cup, maybe his last.At Uruguay's base he appeared unaffected by his ignominious history at the tournament, answering questions from journalists about previous disciplinary breakdowns with no outward signs of discomfort. There seemed to be no attempts to hide anything, either.Suarez has taken steps to address his on-field behavior for Uruguay, he said, with the help of Oscar Tabarez, the coach and former teacher who has been in charge for Suarez's entire international career.""Tabarez helps a lot. He's one of the best coaches in the world because of his personality, the way he helps players,"" Suarez said. ""Personally, he has helped me a lot. Before games, he always talks to me about what goes on in my head. That's important to me. That talk I have with him is important.""For over a decade, Tabarez has worked to develop a specific team mantra in the Uruguay squad, putting emphasis on humility, work ethic and respect for others.That has manifested itself at the team's World Cup base in Russia, a sports center on the outskirts of Nizhny Novgorod where the players' accommodation is more like school dormitories than five-star luxury.From the camp, stories emerge of Uruguay's best players and biggest stars being asked to clear away their own plates and cutlery after meals, wash their own boots, carry training equipment to and from the field, and, in a nod to plain good manners, start press conferences by greeting journalists with a ""good morning"" or ""good afternoon.""Suarez also spoke about the ""serenity"" Tabarez brought to the squad and referred to himself, once the troublemaker, as now a veteran and a role model.""Now I'm one of the oldest, an example ... the younger ones look up to us,"" Suarez said. ""You get nervous (in games), but at the same time you are one of the ones who has to remain calm. You have to set a good example to the younger ones. You have learned how to handle these situations.""",economictimes.indiatimes.com,2018-07-05 00:05:00,21,634532

(Source: AAP/Twitter via PTI) New Delhi: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal being welcomed by government and staff at Delhi Secretariat, in New Delhi on Wednesday, July 04, 2018. (Source: AAP/Twitter via PTI)
The judgment of the constitutional bench has been greeted with general approval by all political parties and with great euphoria by the Aam Admi Party (AAP). What emanates from three separate judgments delivered by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and his two brother judges is, first, a veritable history of the administration of Delhi. The labyrinthine route that was traversed over several decades of administering the Capital has been captured in copious detail. It is hoped that it would bring some sobriety into the grandstanding by a host of actors.
The Supreme Court’s Wednesday verdict has made three very important deviations from the Delhi High Court judgment of August 2016. It has dispelled the idea that the elected government has to wait to implement its decisions until the lieutenant governor (LG) acquiesces. More specifically, the advice given by the council of ministers is binding on the LG. But only as long as the LG does not exercise his constitutional power to differ and refer the matter to the President for a decision. Although it has been emphasised that this power is not to be exercised mechanically, anything that has sensitivity or can cast a financial burden which is beyond the government’s capacity or cause political problems with the Centre or other states will fall in this area. This actually covers a lot of area.
What does all this mean for Delhi’s citizens? First, as long as every decision has been taken within the ambit of the Transaction of Business Rules 1993 ,which mandates informing the LG of decisions taken by the council of ministers or even by an individual minister, implementation of decisions can start without awaiting approvals. But the Rules also have two important sub-chapters which refer to examination and concurrence by the finance and the law departments. This means a host of proposals can be called to question. Just a note of dissent given by the departmental secretary will give a handle to the LG to differ and withhold further action.
That there ought to be discussion, dialogue and a genuine effort to solve problems is inbuilt in the rules, and has been reiterated strongly by the three judgments. For example, embargoes on vehicles converging on Delhi’s roads or placing restrictions on hospitals or educational institutions by the council of ministers would have implications for the governance of the Capital — it belongs to the whole country. So, restrictions cannot be imposed without the LG having had an opportunity to discuss the pros and cons and return the matter for reconsideration. In Delhi’s case, the LG can differ, ask for reconsideration and make a reference to the Centre. Till a decision comes, the LG’s orders would prevail. So, it is not all plain sailing.
Under the Transaction of Business Rules, consultation with the finance and law departments is mandatory and the chief secretary — the secretary of the cabinet — has to ensure that the cabinet note has followed the process very elaborately spelt out in the 1993 rules. These have been alluded to by the apex court at numerous places in the judgments. In other words, getting advisers and consultants to prepare cabinet notes and clearing them with a simple nod will not work. Haranguing officers and imputing motives to them will not result in either compliance or implementation. At the end of the day, the proof of the pudding will be in the delivery of promised services — not in a display of strongman tactics to impress constituencies.
On the face of it, it may seem as though the Delhi government will now have the authority to make laws on all subjects, excluding those which fall directly under the LG’s authority. But that is actually not so. For instance, the Jan Lokpal Bill and the mohalla committee strategy. Both have been points of confrontation, resulting even in the resignation of the chief minister in his first term. Nothing has changed with all the judgments of the Supreme Court. The apex court has reiterated that any law which is repugnant to a law made by Parliament cannot be passed by the legislative assembly. And indeed these bills or concepts would even now run into repugnancy issues and will be negated as Parliament’s laws do not envisage such deviations being made to the existing central acts.
If the spirit of the judgments is to be read, all postings and transfers of officers should return to as it was in the Sheila Dikshit era, with only the postings of principal secretaries needing the acquiescence of the LG because that makes for better management with the Centre which controls the cadre. However the selection and posting of the chief secretary, the home secretary and secretary lands needs the specific approval of the LG as per the Transaction of Business Rules, which have now been accorded a new sanctity.
The judges have explained that the administrator as per rules has to be apprised of each decision taken by a minister or council of ministers and difference of opinion must meet the standards of constitutional trust and morality, the principle of collaborative federalism and constitutional balance. “The element of trust is an imperative between constitutional functionaries” so that their governments “can work in accordance with constitutional norms”.
Last but not least it is curtains for the idea of statehood. As long as Delhi is the national capital, it is everyone’s capital and the voice of non-Delhi citizens have to be heard through the central government acting on the decisions of Parliament. AAP’s hopes were misplaced and should not be resurrected afresh.

"Sardesai has defended himself well, insisting that as the keeper of the agriculture portfolio, he will use every available ploy to focus attention on farms. Sardesai has defended himself well, insisting that as the keeper of the agriculture portfolio, he will use every available ploy to focus attention on farms.
Vijay Sardesai, agriculture minister of Goa, has gained instant stand-up fame by urging farmers to recite the “mahamrityunjaya beej mantra” in their fields. This is DIY farm distress relief by meditating and chanting, “Om rom jum sah”. Sardesai has defended himself well, insisting that as the keeper of the agriculture portfolio, he will use every available ploy to focus attention on farms. If a rock show would do it, he has said, he would organise one. An excellent idea. For a progressive minister, we recommend progressive rock: imagine Jethro Tull playing ‘Jack in the Green’ amidst the waving fields of sorghum. It might not increase the yield per hectare, but would certainly elevate happiness per capita.
But it is unlikely that the minister will promote rock. Channeling the cosmic forces into the womb of Mother Earth is his chosen way. He appears to have come under the influence of a godman — which is quite a popular activity in our country — via his wife, who has been inflicting the principles of Shiv Yog Cosmic Farming on her plants at home. Nothing wrong with the wife’s pursuit, of course. One may follow any fad at all in private, so long as laws are not broken or the modesty of the home outraged. But a minister does not have the right to use his position to project his domestic fad upon the world.
Goa’s cashews and arecas will not be harmed in the course of this experiment, but it is unlikely to bear fruit. It may have worked in ancient times, but after the synthesis of superphosphate and urea, the seeds sprout just fine without the help of a beej mantra. Only the government in Panjim is getting to reap a harvest from this — the derision of India’s farmers.

"Swami Vivekananda’s birthday is celebrated as National Youth Day in India. (File Photo) Swami Vivekananda’s birthday is celebrated as National Youth Day in India. (File Photo)
As I recall Swami Vivekananda on his death anniversary, I realise the nature of the obstacles that often obstruct the possibility of a calm and subtle engagement with the radical monk. To begin with, in this crudely materialistic world where there is hardly any trace of the Upanishadic wisdom, it is not easy to be charmed by the tales of a university educated young man in the late 19th century surrendering before the spiritually musical Ramakrishna, known for his extraordinary simplicity and capability to blend folk metaphors with Vedantic wisdom.
Second, the age of instantaneity invites depthlessness, and even religiosity becomes a commodity sold by all sorts of “brand” gurus and distributed through television channels and self-help pocket books. No wonder, it is not easy to acquire the patience to feel the paradoxical life-trajectory of Vivekananda. And finally, poltics is a clever game of appropriation. As this “Hindu” monk is projected as an icon of the assertive Hindutva politics, many “left-liberals” become overtly cautious; they prefer to retain a “safe” distance from him. This is a blow to the spirit of dialogue.
Yet, he needs to be seen more deeply and meaningfully. For instance, we should not forget that Vivekananda too responded to colonialism — the way its asymmetrical cultural politics degraded the Orient, and aroused a sense of defeatism and passivity amongst the colonised. In a way, he sought to awaken the spirit of the wounded and defeated race. The celebrated speech he delivered at the Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893, indicates the monk’s urge to alter the discourse of colonial hierarchy, and assert the heritage of India — “the mother of religions”, and why we should feel “proud” to belong to “a nation that has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth”. The spirit of the recovery of our lost self-pride with some sort of essentialisation could also be seen in another discourse, ‘The East and the West’. While the West is “maddened with the wine of newly acquired powers”, India as a resurgent nation, the Swami felt, ought to offer something new. “Well, then, my foreigner, you are not so strong as you think yourself to be. Understand that India has strength as well, and India is still living because she has her own quota yet to give to the general store of the world’s civilization”.
Swami’s words were intoxicating. No wonder, his constant plea for strength and courage, and his metaphorical celebration of “football” and “muscles of iron, nerves of steel and gigantic will” for regenerating a nation finding its soul and uniqueness in religiosity did inspire a generation willing to restore India’s self-pride.
In this approach it is not altogether impossible to see the seeds of what these days we regard as “religious nationalism” with some sort of “Hindu pride” that led the monk — otherwise influenced by the spiritual syncretism of Ramakrishna — to think that “in spite of their tyranny and the vile language they are given to utter, we will and must go on building churches for the Christians and mosques for the Mohammedans until we conquer through love”. This “Hindu tolerance” amidst Mohammedan or Christian “invasion” seems to be inherently problematic in a religiously heterogeneous society because of its hegemonic/paternalistic tendency.
Yet, as I see, it would be naive if we fail to see the other possibility in the monk’s engaged religiosity — particularly, in what he regarded as “Practical Vedanta”. The spirit of the Vedanta — the mediation between the finite and the infinite, and the boundless energy innate in otherwise limited embodied existence — has to be rescued from the caves and the mountains, and it must awaken all of us. This faith in oneself, Vivekananda asserted repeatedly, is true religiosity, and hence “you are an atheist if you do not believe in yourself”. However, this is not “selfish faith”; instead, “it means faith in all because you are all”. This explains the other face of the monk — his social activism and compassion. Imagine the intensity of his appeal to the “would-be patriots” — “Do you feel? Do you feel that millions are starving today, and millions have been starving for ages? Do you feel that ignorance has come over the land as a dark cloud? Does it make you restless? Does it make you sleepless?” Not surprisingly, in his fiery speeches the condition of the subaltern would come up repeatedly. They need emancipatory education; and Vivekananda wanted his sanyasins to move from village to village with “a camera, a globe, some maps”, and teach a “great deal of astronomy and geography to the masses”. Is it possible to see the seeds of socialism in this sort of spiritual activism?
Well, there are critiques. Even though in a powerful essay, ‘Modern India’, Vivekananda saw the possibility of “the rising of the Shudra class” as some sort of “socialism”, and urged his countrymen to believe that “the lower classes, the ignorant, the poor, the illiterate, the cobbler, the sweeper are thy flesh and blood, thy brothers”, this reform from within may not be appreciated by the Ambedkarites for whom the eradication of the caste system means the eradication of Hinduism itself. Likewise, the feminists are likely to see a danger in the Swami’s idealisation of the woman in India as “the mother, the mother first, and the mother last”.
Yet, as I would argue, we need to see beyond “for” and “against”, and explore diverse ways of creating a spiritually enriched/egalitarian society. And in the age of totalitarian thinking and intellectual untouchability, it is not a bad idea to converse with Vivekananda as well as Marx, Ramakrishna as well as Jalaluddin Rumi.

A mother of an incurably ill six-year-old boy faces up to eight years in prison in Russia for trying to sell anti-seizure medication she bought for her child, she and charities said on Wednesday.
The case -- the first of its kind in the country -- has horrified Russian charity workers and activists who deal with heart-wrenching cases on a daily bases.
Last month police opened a criminal case into the distribution of narcotics after Moscow mum-of-two Yekaterina Konnova bought diazepam rectal gel -- which is not available in Russia legally -- to treat her son Arseny's seizures.
Diazepam is a prescription medication used to treat seizures and anxiety and is available in various forms including in ampules and rectal gel tubes.
While the medication in ampules is registered in Russia, gel tubes -- which are more convenient to administer and cause no pain -- are not, unlike in the West, where they are widely used.
Most modern anti-epileptic drugs for children are not registered in Russia, forcing parents to buy them abroad or purchase them illegally on the black market.
Moscow police staged a sting operation and detained Konnova, a single mum, when she tried to sell several tubes she no longer needed.
'It's been hell'
""It's been hell,"" Konnova told AFP, adding her son needed to be medicated all the time and that she could not afford the expensive drugs.
""Arseny suffers pain 24/7,"" she said.
The boy has a litany of illnesses including cerebral palsy and epileptic seizures.
""He's got a tube in his stomach, a tube in his neck and he also suffers from terrible seizures, many times a day, every day,"" wrote Lida Moniava, deputy director at the Lighthouse, a children's hospice in Moscow.
""We are horrified by what's happening because if Katya goes to prison Aseny will end up in a care home for the disabled where he will quickly die and his elder brother will go to an orphanage,"" she said on Facebook.
Konnova faces between four and eight years in prison for drug dealing, charities said.
Nyuta Federmesser, a hugely respected public figure who supports Russian hospices, called on President Vladimir Putin to intervene and change legislation to help alleviate the suffering of young patients and their families.
""We are developing nanotechnology, we can organise the World Cup and host Olympic Games, we fly to space, we develop gene engineering, we have crypto currencies and blockchain,"" she wrote in an appeal on Facebook.
""Cannot we change legislation???""

"Siddaramaiah-led Congress government had ordered the caste census in Karnataka. File photo: Mint
Bengaluru: Three years after the previous Siddaramaiah-led Congress government embarked on an ambitious caste census in Karnataka, the first in the country since 1932, the report, which was meant to challenge the dominant caste theory in the state, is still to be published and may never see the light of day.
The “Socio-Economic and Education Survey”, which was carried out at a cost of Rs147 crore and involved more than 160,000 personnel reaching out door-to-door to over 13.5 million households in the state over 45 days, was expected to be released before the May 2018 assembly elections.
However, the report, which has been submitted to the previous government, may never be released, according to one Congress legislator who requested anonymity. Another person familiar with the discussions of the coordination committee meetings of the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) coalition government said that the issue of the caste census has not been tabled before the forum as other bigger issues such as farm loan waiver has taken precedence.
Representative bodies of Lingayats and Vokkaligas, believed to be the two largest caste groups in the state, had threatened protests if the findings were made public. The leaders of these communities were also backed by some Congress leaders who urged the government not to release the report, especially before the assembly elections.
With the 2019 elections inching closer, the publication of the report, that would earn the ire of dominant communities, may not help the party get the votes of these groups, which it desperately needs to end the domination of the BJP, in terms of parliamentary seats from Karnataka.
Recent experiments like granting the minority religion status to the Lingayats and neglecting the Vokaligas, has cost the Congress dearly in the May assembly elections where it got only 80 seats when compared to 122 in 2013.
Dominant communities were anxious after leaked findings of the report (which the government has denied) estimated the Lingayat population to be below 10% from earlier claimed figures of 17-18% and Vokkaliga from around 14% to around 8% of the state’s population, making the Dalits the single biggest group at around 24%. Nearly 55% of Karnataka’s population is from the backward classes, a section that had helped Siddaramaiah storm to power in 2013.
The Congress, which burnt its fingers over the contentious issue of granting minority religion status to the Lingayats, would risk losing the Vokkaliga vote base to the JD(S) if the report were to, as purported, show an erosion of the population percentages of these communities, according to the leaked findings of the report. Large communities like the Vokkaligas and Lingayats fear that any document that would estimate lower population percentages would mean that it would have to part with benefits that it receives.
JD(S), led by former prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda, is seen as a party that enjoys unstinted support from the Vokkaligas, who are concentrated in southern Karnataka, the regional party’s bastion.
Siddaramaiah, one of only five non-Lingayat-non-Vokkaliga chief ministers in the political history of the state, had attempted to challenge the dominant caste theory, increase benefits to marginalised sections and help consolidate the voter base firmly behind the Congress. However, the opposition from within his own party ranks and leadership kept the Kuruba strongman from releasing the report.
Though there was no official data on the size of any specific community, experts on the subject say that many groups arrived at figures by adding 2.2% to the estimates every 10 years. The Backward Classes Welfare Department of the state, which is now backing up the data for other applications including identifying eligible beneficiaries for employment and education among other benefits, have denied that the report could never be released.
“We have apprised the chief minister of the report. Even the backward classes commission has met him over this report,” said Mohammed Mohsin, secretary, backward classes welfare department.
The data, which was gathered using 55 questions, including those on income, expenditure, ownership of vehicle, occupation, qualification and caste grouping among others, can be put to various other uses in other departments as well, said Mohsin. He, however, said that whether the report would be released or not would be a decision that the government would have to take.",www.livemint.com,2018-07-05 00:03:28,23,158980

"A MUM on the warpath, seething with rage at her teenage children, smashed down her son's bedroom door with a sledgehammer, even threatening to have him killed.
""You are a dead man walking,"" she yelled at him.
The 43-year-old Springfield Lakes mother pleaded guilty in Ipswich Magistrates Court to obstructing police, and to three charges of contravening domestic violence orders in April and June 2018.
Her lawyer told the court she was in a loving and supportive relationship with her husband of 20 years but had alcohol issues.
Prosecutor Sergeant Paul Caldwell said police received a 000 call from her son, aged 17, on April 24, saying his mother smashed down his bedroom door with a sledgehammer after ""drinking alcohol all day"".
Police found the door to be completely destroyed, the mother later telling them she was trying to teach her son a lesson.
Sgt Caldwell said officers had to handcuff the woman because of her behaviour.
When arrested and taken to a police car, the mother kept refusing to sit up so her seatbelt could be put on.
She continued to verbally abuse the officers, saying ""f--- you, I don't give a f---"", while laying down again across the back seat.
Placed in a cell at the police watch house the irate mother began kicking the glass door before being moved to a padded cell.
In an incident on June 27 the mother threw punches at her daughter and scratched her face when the daughter asked where her belongings were.
The frightened daughter barricaded herself in a bedroom using a set of drawers.
Her mother threatened that she would get a sledgehammer to force entry.
Sgt Caldwell said the girl phoned her brother, who arrived home to help her.
The court heard that police located the older teenage girl with facial injuries.
When their mother left with police, she stopped and gave her children a menacing look.
The son told police that when he arrived home he poured an open bottle of vodka down the sink and his mother lunged at him.
""Fearing for his safety he restrained his mother on a couch and she continued with a tirade of abuse,"" Sgt Caldwell said.
""She says she will organise someone to kill him, and he was a dead man walking.""
Defence lawyer Brianna McKenzie said the woman lived in a loving relationship and had other children.
She had no criminal history.
Ms McKenzie told the court the woman had sought mental health help and treatment for alcohol and anger issues.
""She recognises her actions were wrong, and has shame, embarrassment and genuine remorse,"" Ms McKenzie said.
Magistrate David Shepherd said the offences were serious and were likely brought about by the woman's excessive use of alcohol.
He said he had read her husband's letter, but blaming their children was not going to achieve anything, and that the responsibility lay with her.
Mr Shepherd said underlying issues needed to be dealt with as alcohol would only make matters worse.
""Irrespective of their attitudes to life it would be unpleasant to see their mother conducting herself in that way,"" Mr Shepherd said.
He sentenced her to a supervised 12-month probation order to allow the continuation of her rehabilitation process.",www.dailyexaminer.com.au,2018-07-05 00:03:00,28,692405
"Burari deaths: The house where the bodies were found, in the Burari area of North Delhi. (Photo: Gajendra Yadav) Burari deaths: The house where the bodies were found, in the Burari area of North Delhi. (Photo: Gajendra Yadav)
It is a truth universally acknowledged that we all love bad news: The worse it gets, the better it is. A good murder, a whiff of mystery? Bull’s eye. A mass killing, a hint of the occult? Donald couldn’t trump that and Neymar couldn’t cry foul.
So the deaths of 11 members of the Bhatia family by “suicide” or murder transfixed the attention. We wanted to know, no, not about Rahul Gandhi’s latest holiday, or the “Grand Alliance” to oust Narendra Modi, but about pipes: 11 of them, precisely, on the wall of the Bhatia home, shown repeatedly on TV news. What secret meaning had they held for the family now dead?
Nobody knew, no one could tell. TV news, Hindi and English, questioned the Delhi Police, relatives of the family, neighbours of the family, without revelation.
Had it not been for the diaries found on the premises, we would have been even less the wiser about possible reasons for the deaths: The surviving Bhatia daughter/sibling, told news channels her family was as ordinary, normal as yours or mine; when ABP spoke to Rishi, who delivered 20 rotis to the family that fateful night, he insisted the Bhatia daughters behaved perfectly ordinarily. Who could believe them?
Not the media, which along with the police, went through Delhi’s “House of Horrors”(India Today) with a fine comb; psychologists and godmen were consulted — on Tez, psychologist Soumya Tandon spoke of the power of persuasion, belief and faith. Did Lalit “brainwash” the family into seeking “moksha”? The truth, alas, had died with the 11 deceased and by Tuesday, the trail was growing cold.
To send a shiver down the spine, some news channels went tabloid: They showed photographs of the dead, blindfolded, the noose around their necks, with a mosaic as flimsy as gossamer, no, as thin as the air, ineffectually used to camouflage them (Aaj Tak, India Today and India TV). Sickening.
It is also a universal truth, which we must acknowledge, that such lurid photographs and reports will be watched, often at the cost of other terrible crimes. However, the “What’sAppDeaths” (CNN News 18) were widely reported and became the subject of TV debates (NDTV 24×7), possibly because of the social media connection in the lynching. Nowadays, lynching has become the site of political contestation with the actual murders forgotten in the heat of ideological confrontation, so common in the battles on the box.
Another truth: Everybody loves the weather report and if there is a flood, well, mud in your eye. The rain in Mumbai that felled a bridge and caused distress to lakhs of people saw TV news question authorities on the recurring nightmare: Zee’s visuals showed that in the last 11 years, the rain has brought the city to a standstill; ABP had floods damaging different parts of the country again and again; India TV accompanied a city train on a water ski through the city.
This we also know to be true: If there is any news that may be good news for opposition parties, it will be overlooked for other “news” on certain channels. Thus, on Wednesday, when news of the Supreme Court judgment on AAP and the LG was announced, Times Now was busy tut-tutting that those behind Gauri Lankesh’s murder were “scot free” and Republic had obtained another “letter” with the IB on the “UrbanNaxal” link to Kashmir. No mention of the SC verdict — even Doordarshan News reported it, albeit with strictures against AAP’s habit of playing politics.
Salman Khan brought up his encounters with the courts while he played money games on 10 Ka Dum (Sony). He referred to his earnings and how they were spent (on courts), by way of endearing himself to the contestant, already quite besotted. Between interacting with the superstar and making moolah by guessing “how many Indian parents speak about sex education to their children?”, or “how many Indians make crores without working?”, a question better put to the likes of Nirav Modi, the contestants can hardly believe their luck.
Likewise those who look at photos, find the correct answer to questions like, “Wahan pe kuch likho” — the answer is to write “kuch” wahan pe — and end up winning lakhs (Sabse Smart Kaun, Star Plus). That’s how easy it is to make money without working.
Finally, do watch Musakan about a sex worker and her daughter, if only for the subject matter; also, Mitegi Laxman Rekha (&TV) where Kanchan faces the consequences of abduction and molestation (rape?) with the help of Vishesh. A TV serial with a contemporary theme? Har Shaakh Pe Ullu Baitha Hai (Star Plus) in which politician Gainda Devi challenges chief minister Chaitu Lal to a fitness contest.

"Thai navy SEALs and rescue teams started giving crash courses in diving and swimming to the group of trapped young soccer players, hoping for a swift end to their harrowing ordeal.
Rescue divers on Tuesday found the twelve teenagers and their coach alive after they went missing in a Thai cave more than 10 days ago. But authorities said it remained unclear how long the boys would have to remain inside.
The boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach entered the cave to celebrate a birthday. They became trapped when sudden rainfall flooded its entry on June 23. Similar incidents have befallen other visitors at the local tourist spot.
On Wednesday, Thai authorities provided food and medicine to the soccer group while experts assessed the conditions needed to evacuate them safely.
""The water is very strong and space is narrow. Extracting the children take a lot of people,"" Prawit Wongsuwan, Thailand's deputy prime minister, told reporters.
""Now we are teaching the children to swim and dive,"" he said, adding that if water levels subside, the Wild Boar soccer team would be taken out easily.
Another option would be to drill a hole into the cave and airlift the boys out. But authorities say they prefer the diving option.

Preparations underway
In a video released on Wednesday, the soccer players said they were in good health. The boys and their coach are seen sitting with Thai navy SEALs in the dark cave with their emaciated faces visible in the one-minute video.
Rescuers said they would not put the boys' lives in danger and would take ""no risk"" to free them.
""All 13 don't have to come out at the same time,"" Narongsak Osottanakorn, governor of Chiang Rai province, told reporters on Wednesday. ""Who is ready first can go first.""
Weerachon Sukondhapatipak, a government spokesman, said more preparations are needed to rescue the boys.
""Some of them can't swim, so therefore it will take time for them to adjust,"" he said.
""Officials would teach them how to move, how to dive, how to move their body under those circumstances,"" he added.
Somboon Sompiangjai told Reuters news agency that his son Peerapat, 16, could swim. He said he was confident that SEALs would eventually get the boys out.
""I am not worried if the kids have to swim and dive,"" he said. ""I felt much better after seeing the clips with the children in good spirits, even though they were in there for 10 days.""

"The spectacle of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak being hauled to court to face corruption charges gripped Malaysians and marked a historic moment in the nation's politics.
Najib, who until recently was at the apex of power in the Southeast Asian country, now must face the ignominy of defending himself against accusations of corruption.
The massive graft scam involving the state-run multibillion-dollar 1MDB fund, tarnished Najib's reputation and many believe it played a major role in his party's defeat in recently held elections, which upended the nation's political landscape.
On Wednesday, Najib pleaded not guilty to three charges of criminal breach of trust and a fourth for abuse of power. He has been released on bail and was ordered to surrender his two diplomatic passports. His trial will begin in February 2019.
The court also granted an interim gag order that Najib's lawyers requested. This would limit media coverage to only ""the merits of the case,"" and hamper reporting on a high-profile story spanning six countries. Malaysian Attorney General Tommy Thomas, who leads a 12-member prosecution team, will file a formal response opposing the order.
The return of good governance?
Social media has been awash with posts and memes by Malaysians welcoming the news of the imminent trial of a leader who they see as having enriched himself with public funds while tainting the country's image.
Many attribute the swift investigation and Najib's subsequent arrest to the current ruling party Pakatan Harapan's pre-election promise to deal with the 1MDB scandal.
""Truth be told, I believe that his being brought to justice was partly driven by public pressure. After all, it is us who put the current government in charge of running this country,"" Kuala Lumpur-based legal consultant, Madeleine D’Angelus, told DW.
Bridget Welsh, associate professor of political science and Southeast Asia expert at the John Cabot University, who is currently in Kuala Lumpur observing the proceedings, said that this case will also reinforce the issue of good governance — something that the public found lacking during Najib's tenure as premier.
""It is a precarious situation because it's a highly politicized arrest that shows that what goes around comes around. It also shows that Malaysia is moving towards a cleaner process and there's a lot of hope. People are pleased. For many Malaysians, Najib betrayed the public's trust,"" she told DW.
Read more: Malaysia says seized items in ex-premier probe valued at €234 million
Death knell for corruption?
Described as the ""world’s biggest financial scandal,"" the 1MDB issue laid bare the rampant and deep-rooted corruption within the Malaysian government and some of the external bodies associated with it.
""The problem of corruption is endemic in Malaysia — it's not just within politics but also businesses. So this is the beginning of a very important step and sends a signal that leaders are accountable and cannot misuse public funds. It moves Malaysia in the right direction to clean out the dirt,"" said Welsh.
Others see Najib's prosecution as a warning to members of the current Pakatan Harapan government under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, as well as future administrations, to conduct their affairs transparently and not to the detriment of the electorate who voted them into office.
""There is already a new policy in place stating that gifts to government figures are to be kept to a minimum. If this is further strengthened by legislative developments and the guarantee of the independence of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), then I am confident that this will see the end of most corruption,"" Azmi Sharom, associate professor of law at University Malaya, told DW.
""Money politics, that is to say buying patronage and support, will probably go on in parties such as UMNO which, by their selection of [former deputy prime minister] Zahid Hamidi as their new president, have shown that they want to continue business as usual,"" Azmi added.

Malaysia sets up task force to probe 1MDB scandal
Not going down alone
Both Najib and his supporters have contended that the charges against him are politically motivated. This places the onus on the current administration under Mahathir to not just establish a watertight case against Najib, but also to dispel rumors of political retribution.
Najib, who also held the finance portfolio during his tenure as prime minister, has previously claimed ignorance of any wrongdoing in the daily business of 1MDB.
""His name is on the documents and the money was in his bank account. The MACC wouldn't have arrested him without due cause. They have not rushed into it. It's been five weeks since they started conducting the investigations and counting the goodies,"" explained Welsh, adding that Najib is unlikely to go down alone.
""I would say that the directors involved in 1MDB will be affected as well. Other former ministers are coming forward too. There is a collective responsibility.""
Azmi argues that the political consequences are not as important as the criminal consequences.
""The anti-money laundering law in Malaysia has a very broad range of offenses; anyone proven to have received money from 1MDB will be in serious danger of prosecution.""
The neighbors are watching
Najib's arrest and imminent trial may also have international implications, which could prove discomfiting to some Southeast Asian nations.
""While Najib isn't the first leader to be arrested in Southeast Asia, his arrest makes history in Malaysia,"" said Welsh. ""Among Southeast Asian neighbors, Singapore would be watching very closely as its [banking sector's] involvement with the 1MDB has not been fully divulged yet,"" said Welsh.
Azmi also believes that the prosecution could look to Malaysia's neighbors for cues on how to best navigate the unchartered territory of bringing high-ranking government officials to justice.
""In terms of battling corruption, Indonesia has made some impressive progress and could probably be a better example to look to,"" he told DW.
Read more: Malaysia's Anwar Ibrahim: from prisoner to prime minister-in-waiting
Reckoning ahead
Despite their jubilance that justice is finally being meted out, Malaysians are remaining rather pragmatic.
Fahmi Reza, political critic, street artist and documentary filmmaker, who was jailed last year for publishing a clown caricature of Najib, was among those following the proceedings in Kuala Lumpur.
""The arrest and prosecution brings us one step closer towards getting some justice, but the fight against corruption and kleptocracy is far from being over. We still have a long way to go if we want to end the culture of impunity and corruption in this country,"" Fahmi told DW.
In a prerecorded message to his fellow Malaysians posted on Twitter on Tuesday, Najib apologized and sought forgiveness from fellow Malaysians, adding that despite doing his very best ""there were many weaknesses.""
Najib also fired a salvo at the current administration. ""Everyone is equal before the law,"" he said. ""Not just in the world, but also judgment in the afterlife.""",www.taiwannews.com.tw,2018-07-05 00:02:00,53,1589
"GST model aiming to ease concerns of short changing, while not annoying smaller states
Posted
The Federal Government wants to adopt a new model for carving up the billions of dollars in GST revenue, but will have to chip in cash to ensure no state is worse off.
Treasurer Scott Morrison will today unveil a proposal for changing the system, after a year-long review by the government's main independent economic advisor, the Productivity Commission.
It will seek to walk the fine line between easing concerns from some states that they have been done over by the current model, and ensuring smaller states do not cry poor.
How does it work?
The proposal works in stages. In the first instance, the Federal Government will top up WA's share of GST revenue after the mining boom wore off.
The next step involves the Commonwealth adding hundreds of millions of dollars to the GST pool, to ensure smaller states do not fall behind as the new calculation model is adopted.
That will begin at $600 million annually from the 2020/21 financial year. From the 2024/25 financial year, another $250 million will be added to that annually. It will cost more than $7 billion.
The formula will also be tweaked to tie the fortunes of smaller states to that of the largest state, New South Wales or Victoria.
By 2026/27, the changes will be done. And the Government is promising every state will get at least 75 cents for every dollar they contribute.
The Productivity Commission's preferred model would have annoyed most of the states, changing the formula for carving up the cash to one which looks at the average wealth of the states.
Only New South Wales and WA would be better off under that model.
Chris Richardson from Deloitte Access Economics described it as a ""sensible"" proposal from the Government, even if it was not adopting the commission's preferred approach.
""But mostly sensible has come with a whole bunch of political landmines in it, and the Government's response is looking to be rather more careful on this front,"" he told AM.
""This is far from solving the problem, but at least it would address and improve some of the problems that we have.
""This is a pretty solid change, and the first notable change in some time, and it's overdue.""
No state worse off, argues Turnbull
Yesterday, the Prime Minister declared his Government had rejected the Productivity Commission's preferred option.
""You will see, as I have said, that no state will be worse off as a result of the reforms,"" he said.
""In fact, each state will be better off.""
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten remained unconvinced, arguing there was no guarantee no state would see a reduction in their share of the revenue over the period.
""All that we expect is that at some point in the future, average Aussies will see a decrease to their hospitals and schools,"" he said.
He told a community forum in Tasmania, where he is campaigning ahead of the Braddon by-election, that Western Australia had been unfairly treated in the GST carve-up.
But he claimed that was not a situation Tasmania should be relied upon to fix.
The Productivity Commission was specifically tasked to assess the GST formula which is used to determine the share each jurisdiction receives.
The formula — called horizontal fiscal equalisation — is calculated on the basis of how much funding each jurisdiction should receive from the overall pool to deliver services, taking into account their own sources of revenue and spending.
Mr Morrison received the final report in mid-May, and has released it just weeks from the Super Saturday of by-elections in Western Australia, Tasmania, Queensland and South Australia.
A draft report released last October found the current formula needed updating to deal with extreme circumstances.
Pressure for change
The latest announcement on the GST carve-up in April boosted the share of revenue collected by Victoria and Western Australia.
But despite that, WA Treasurer Ben Wyatt attacked the increase as a ""slap in the face"".
He demanded urgent reform.
Mr Shorten has suggested the Coalition is not running candidates in by-elections in Western Australian seats to avoid a backlash over GST distribution.
A number of Coalition politicians have told the ABC they think the GST debate was a factor in the Government's decision not to run in either WA seat.
One Nation has campaigned on the need for a more ""fair and just"" distribution, including WA senator Peter Georgiou portraying himself as a gladiator fighting for his home state.

IT'S been under consideration for years and now Livingstone Shire Council says it's time to seriously investigate moving the Yeppoon Showgrounds to Barmaryee.
Land off Milroy Drive and Stanley Avenue has been identified as a suitable site and with unanimous backing of councillors, state government funding will now be sought to evaluate the proposal.
The new showgrounds would have expanded capacity to run an agricultural show, but at the heart of the council's plan lies a facility capable of hosting national and international equestrian events.
Close proximity to the racecourse and pony club would facilitate a dedicated regional equestrian sports precinct, which deputy mayor, NIgel Hutton said would allow equestrian athletes to train on the Capricorn Coast and open up further sports tourism opportunities.
Mayor Bill Ludwig said discussion about relocating the showgrounds dated back to the early 2000s, but the research needed to be done.
""We can't find out if we don't do the homework,” Cr Ludwig said.
""This funding would allow us to do the feasibility study...to evaluate and advance plans.”
The current proposal affects only the showgrounds and it was envisaged that other users of Stevensen Park, including the markets, would not be impacted or move ""unless they wanted to”.
Cr Ludwig said the show society ""was excited that this motion is coming to the table” and Keppel MP, Brittany Lauga had agreed to fully support the funding application.
His comments were yesterday endorsed by Yeppoon Show Society president, Ken Landsberg who said they had been pushing for the move and for an equestrian centre for some time.
""We've outgrown the area in town and parking is a terrible problem,” he said.

OFF TO JAIL: Nicholas Raymond Trafford viciously bashed a man and will pay the price for it. Contributed
ACTIONS have consequences and lives can be destroyed in seconds as one young CQ man learnt the hard way as he was led off to jail.
Not only had Nicholas Raymond Trafford, 20, wrecked his life but also his victim's face after a vicious blind-siding attack at a Puma service station on March 16, 2016.
On Tuesday morning, a solemn dread-locked Trafford had pleaded guilty to the charge of unlawfully doing grievous bodily harm (GBH) in the Rockhampton District Court.
The entire left side of the public gallery of the court room was packed with Trafford's family and supporters who were forced to watch a replay of the CCTV footage capturing the moment when Trafford dashed into the service station with his friend Nicholas Clyde Smithson to brutally bash a man.
The man had been in an argument with a drunken Trafford earlier in the night regarding a female who was known to both men. As he stood at the counter, the victim was punched from behind in the jaw before falling to the ground where he was further kicked and punched by Trafford before staff eventually intervened and he fled the scene.
The man suffered extensive injuries to the jaw and teeth, requiring $7485 worth of medical treatment including the insertion of a titanium plate.
Judge Michael Burnett had already sentenced Smithson for his lesser role in the bashing early last month, giving him probation and ordering him to pay compensation.
Police prosecutor Megan Jones explained how Trafford's criminal history was linked to alcohol abuse history.
She said not only was Trafford the main instigator of the offending which occurred in a public place involving multiple blows to an unsuspecting complainant but ""there was an element of premeditation” as the victim was ""essentially hunted down” and the ""offending only ended with the intervention of third parties”.
Mr Polley pointed to Trafford's troubled upbringing in a broken home which set him off on the wrong path in life, leaving home at the age of 14 before turning to a life abusing alcohol and drugs.
He said his client remembered little of the night in question and was both horrified and surprised watching the video.
Trafford wrote a letter expressing his remorse to the victim and but was resolved to the reality of imprisonment.
Judge Burnett described the attack as a ""most egregious assault” that was ""short but brutal” and ""disproportionate” to any perceived slight.
He described Trafford's behaviour as the ""folly of youth” with a ""failure to think through consequences” but said he had good prospects for rehabilitation.
The judge sentenced Trafford to three years imprisonment with a parole date of April 2, 2019 - in nine months time, with no order to pay compensation given Trafford's current unemployment.",www.themorningbulletin.com.au,2018-07-05 00:01:00,18,464309

ASK FOR ANGELA: Royal Hotel staff member Mackenzi Finger wants everyone to have a safe night out in Gympie. Renee Albrecht
A NORMAL enough night out should never turn into irretrievable disaster, but it can happen.
Royal Hotel owner Stacey Lowe says people who feel things have become unsafe now have an escape route.
Anyone at her hotel who finds themselves in some sort of trouble can now ""ask for Angela”.
The Ask for Angela campaign is new here, but originated in Lincolnshire in Britain.
It has now been brought to Australia by Ms Lowe's daughter, Mackenzi Finger.
""The general idea is that if you are out for the night and feel uncomfortable, you can now ask a member of the hotel staff for 'Angela' and they can get you a taxi, help you leave discreetly or help in any other way to get you into a more comfortable situation,” she said.
Mackenzi thought it was a good idea when she heard about it in England and was reminded of it while working at the hotel one recent Saturday night, when she received a text message from a girlfriend needing ""help on the smokers' deck”.
Mackenzi went to her friend and told her someone was asking for her and was there to pick her up.
""Venue owners and operators will need to ensure all staff and security know the system,” she said.

Rugby Union: It has been eight to nine years since the Hammers held the ""Bone” in their hand and the focus will be to win it on home soil this weekend.
With a double header at Albert Park, the men and women will be aiming for a double win.
Nambour's experienced forward pack and high calibre players will mean an exciting contest.

""We are expecting it to be a tight game and every whistle blown will present an opportunity,” Hammers' coach Jason McPherson said.
""We will need to respect their abilities and need to enforce an aggressive style of defence right from the hooter.”
Hammers had a tough loss to USC in the season opener two weeks ago and McPherson is hoping his side play until full time.
Ben Shephard. Leeroy Todd
""We won't want to give them any opportunities or they will capitalise,” McPherson said.
""Nambour have a good five-eighth and historically has controlled the game very well. We will need to send a lot of traffic his way in both attack and defence.”
With only one loss this year, Nambour will be tough opposition, but McPherson says his boys are up to the challenge.
Matt Jamesy. Leeroy Todd
""These boys have what it takes to topple Nambour. The byes have been a bit disruptive but the boys have come together really well with unseen camaraderie behind the scenes,” he said.
""The blokes are starting to respect each other and the boys are not wanting to shape the new players' game but react to their movement as they get to know each other.”
Despite still missing centre Owen Dugdale, McPherson hopes moving Liam Urwin will lead to chances.

""I will move him to number 10 and put him in a controlling role,” he said.
""Hopefully that will create opportunities with our bigger men in the centres.”
With a few new players blooded, McPherson said he encourages his side to play multiple sports.
""They should be playing as much as they can with their mates. I have always been a big supporter of the boys playing multiple sports,” McPherson said.

It will be a must-win for the Hammers' women to get into the finals when they take on Maroochydore.
""There have been good numbers at training and I am hoping we will go well,” women's coach Mark Crumblin said.
With Maroochydore's big forward pack, speed will be key for the home side.
""The key for us will be getting the ball out wide and using our speed,” Crumblin said.
""Caitlin Urwin and Jemma Lee will be our key players who will hopefully get us over the line.
""Our aim will be to get up the middle and then spread the ball wide to utilise our speed.”
Hammers women will kick-off at 1pm and men's at 2pm on Saturday at Albert Park.",www.gympietimes.com.au,2018-07-05 00:01:00,28,24615
"FEELING THE PINCH: Fuel prices in the Fraser Coast region are on the rise.
FEELING THE PINCH: Fuel prices in the Fraser Coast region are on the rise. Trevor Veale
FRASER Coast motorists are being stung at the bowser with petrol prices approaching a five-year record high.
No matter where residents go to fuel up in our region, they are paying almost 20 cents more per litre than this time last year.
The unleaded fuel average in Hervey Bay for May was 150.5c-a-litre compared to 133.8c-a-litre last year. In 2016, the average for the month was 122.6c-a-litre.
Residents in Maryborough are paying almost the same.
The Heritage City's average petrol price for May was $1.49 a litre, a rise of 31.8 cents from same time two years ago.
Drivers haven't seen petrol prices this high in five years, in 2013 Hervey Bay's yearly average was 154.3-c-a-litre and 153c-a-litre in Maryborough.
Some fuel stations yesterday were charging more than 2013's record-high average price.
The most expensive unleaded fuel in Hervey Bay was 158.4c-a-litre, at the Caltex on the corner of Boat Harbour Dr and Beach Rd.
A number of others also had both unleaded and diesel above the $1.55 a litre mark.
Hervey Bay Boat Club was the lowest to fill-up at, charging 148c a litre for unleaded and 150c a litre for diesel, followed very closely by the Nikenbah Caltex.
In Maryborough, the Caltex on Adelaide St had the highest price asking motorists to pay 152.9c a litre for unleaded and 153.9c a litre for diesel.
If our prices continue to rise, 2018 could set a new high for average fuel price.
RACQ spokeswoman Lucinda Ross said across many major regional Queensland centres, drivers are currently paying about 10c a litre more for fuel than what RACQ considered acceptable.
""Unfortunately we don't expect to see much fuel price relief for families heading away for the start of school holidays,” Ms Ross said. ""In places like Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton and Hervey Bay, prices are more than 10cpl too high - it's so frustrating when we know Queens-landers already pay some of the highest transport costs in the country.”
So far this year Hervey Bay's average petrol price is 143.22c a litre and Maryborough's is 139.98c a litre.
The year with the lowest prices in the five-year timespan was 2016.
Hervey Bay's average for the 12-months dipped to 124c a litre and Maryborough's to 118.1c a litre.

Joseph Dean Geiger at the scene of the Alexandra Headland siege telling media he didn't know Zlatko Sikorsky was a wanted man when he let him in his unit. Nine News
HE MOVED to the Sunshine Coast for a fresh start but now, former River Heads man Joseph Dean Geiger is caught up in a high profile murder case.
The 38-year-old is charged with accessory to murder for his alleged role in helping the accused murderer of 16-year-old Larissa Beliby evade police.
It is alleged Mr Geiger let Zlatko Sikorsky into his Alex Heads apartment which then turned into the scene of a 27-hour siege.
Mr Geiger is expected to be granted bail on Friday if the Maryborough address he listed as his bail address is approved.
That means he could be moving back to the Fraser Coast very soon.
During the stand-off, Mr Geiger told multiple news organisations he didn't know Mr Sikorsky when he ""unwittingly” let him into his home.
But a court has heard phone records showed Mr Geiger communicated with Mr Sikorsky prior to the incident.
Police also allege he brought the accused murderer supplies to the unit during the lengthy ordeal. A bail application was made for Mr Geiger in Maroochydore Magistrates Court on Tuesday.
Prosecutions argued Mr Geiger shouldn't be granted bail as he was at risk of offending and had told police he was dealing drugs.
But Magistrate Matthew McLaughlin indicated he would be granting the accused bail, saying Mr Geiger wasn't an unacceptable risk of committing further offences and his alleged role wasn't significant. He said Mr Geiger was a ""petty criminal”, but there was no suggestion he was a ""standover man or thug”.
Mr Geiger had only been living at the Juan St unit for seven weeks prior to the event which ended in his arrest.
After letting Mr Sikorsky inside the home, an argument between Mr Geiger and his partner caught attention the apartment manager, who then called police.
Police prosecutor Sam Rigby told the Maroochydore court that Mr Geiger had his two children in the unit with the violent fugitive.
Even if granted bail, Geiger is likely to have to serve 28 days behind bars as the current charge breached his parole for a dangerous driving offence.
Mr McLaughlin adjourned the bail hearing until Friday so police could check if the Maryborough bail address listed by Mr Geiger was suitable.
If given the green light, it was likely Mr Geiger would be granted bail - though with strict conditions.
The court heard Mr Geiger told police a man named Ted dropped Mr Sikorsky to his Alex Heads home, but officers have been unable to track the man down as Mr Geiger was unable to provide a phone number or last name.
According to the prosecutor, Mr Geiger told police drugs and guns were a ""normal” part of his life, but denied knowing Mr Sikorsky had brought guns into his home until he saw them on June 29. Outside of court, a man believed to be a family member of Mr Geiger described him as a ""good bloke”.
Mr Sikorsky is facing 20 charges including murder, torture, deprivation of liberty and misconduct with a corpse as well as drug and weapons charges. Palmwoods woman Tracy Ann Thomson, 40, has also been charged with accessory to murder for her alleged role in bringing Mr Sikorsky to the unit.

ASK FOR ANGELA: Royal Hotel staff member Mackenzi Finger wants everyone to have a safe night out in Gympie. Renee Albrecht
A NORMAL enough night out should never turn into irretrievable disaster, but it can happen.
Royal Hotel owner Stacey Lowe says people who feel things have become unsafe now have an escape route.
Anyone at her hotel who finds themselves in some sort of trouble can now ""ask for Angela"".
The Ask for Angela campaign is new here, but originated in Lincolnshire in Britain.
It has now been brought to Australia by Ms Lowe's daughter, Mackenzi Finger.
""The general idea is that if you are out for the night and feel uncomfortable, you can now ask a member of the hotel staff for 'Angela' and they can get you a taxi, help you leave discreetly or help in any other way to get you into a more comfortable situation,"" she said.
Mackenzi thought it was a good idea when she heard about it in England and was reminded of it while working at the hotel one recent Saturday night, when she received a text message from a girlfriend needing ""help on the smokers' deck"".
Mackenzi went to her friend and told her someone was asking for her and was there to pick her up.
""Venue owners and operators will need to ensure all staff and security know the system,"" she said.
""It's another step in creating the safest environment we can for visitors and people in our community when they are in our venues, late at night or otherwise.""",www.dailyexaminer.com.au,2018-07-05 00:01:00,12,692285
"DIVE tour operators are divided over whether tourism will be affected by the ex-HMAS Tobruk landing on her side when she was scuttled last week.
Hervey Bay Dive Centre and Dive Hervey Bay were the two companies chosen by the State Government to conduct recreational diving activities on the ex-Navy Ship.
But when Dive Hervey Bay owner Glenn Bowman, who has 35 years dive instructor experience and more than 3,500 dives logged, watched the ship descend into the ocean's depths on her side, he knew he'd have to reassess his strategy.
<>
Mr Bowman said the unplanned result could reduce projected income by 50 per cent due to less people visiting the town and thus less people purchasing hotel rooms, food and shopping.
""The starboard side is basically not accessible to any divers except divers with wreck penetration diving qualifications,"" he said.
""You need to be able to see an exit or sunlight for an exit to make it a general diver dive site.""
They were conflicting points to Hervey Bay Dive Centre owner Ed Gibson.
Mr Gibson said despite the scuttling not going to the exact plan, open divers would still have a ""really good swim"".
""Divers can still experience propellers and rudders with its position,"" he said.
""It's not unusual for a vessel to land on its side and from a divers point of view, it's still quite accessible.
Photos View Photo Gallery
""I don't think it will affect dive tourism and it will thrive as expected because we will adjust it and amend our dive tours.""
One thing Mr Gibson and Mr Bowman do agree on, however is that the dive will be nothing short of spectacular.
The Chronicle contacted Hinkler MP Keith Pitt, who launched the Tobruk campaign four years ago, to hear his thoughts on the potential impact the vessel's position could have on tourism.
Keith Pitt's office said once the ex-HMAS Tobruk was handed over to the State Government in December 2016, it ceased having any control over the vessel and was unable to comment.
A Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service spokeswoman said despite concerns, the wreck was lying in the correct location, within the restricted access area.
""The first order of operations following any scuttling event is to undertake a safety inspection of the entire wreck,"" she said.
""Contractor Birdon have undertaken the inspections and will be submitting a report to the Queensland Government in coming days.
""This will allow us to review all options and assess the best way to move forward to ensure the best dive opportunity is created.
""The Queensland Government is engaging with the four commercial tour operators to keep them informed of developments during this process and to scope dive experience opportunities.""

"OFF TO JAIL: Nicholas Raymond Trafford viciously bashed a man and will pay the price for it.
OFF TO JAIL: Nicholas Raymond Trafford viciously bashed a man and will pay the price for it. Contributed
ACTIONS have consequences and lives can be destroyed in seconds as one young CQ man learnt the hard way as he was led off to jail.
Not only had Nicholas Raymond Trafford, 20, wrecked his life but also his victim's face after a vicious blind-siding attack at a Puma service station on March 16, 2016.
On Tuesday morning, a solemn dread-locked Trafford had pleaded guilty to the charge of unlawfully doing grievous bodily harm (GBH) in the Rockhampton District Court.
The entire left side of the public gallery of the court room was packed with Trafford's family and supporters who were forced to watch a replay of the CCTV footage capturing the moment when Trafford dashed into the service station with his friend Nicholas Clyde Smithson to brutally bash a man.
The man had been in an argument with a drunken Trafford earlier in the night regarding a female who was known to both men. As he stood at the counter, the victim was punched from behind in the jaw before falling to the ground where he was further kicked and punched by Trafford before staff eventually intervened and he fled the scene.
The man suffered extensive injuries to the jaw and teeth, requiring $7485 worth of medical treatment including the insertion of a titanium plate.
Judge Michael Burnett had already sentenced Smithson for his lesser role in the bashing early last month, giving him probation and ordering him to pay compensation.
Police prosecutor Megan Jones explained how Trafford's criminal history was linked to alcohol abuse history.
She said not only was Trafford the main instigator of the offending which occurred in a public place involving multiple blows to an unsuspecting complainant but ""there was an element of premeditation"" as the victim was ""essentially hunted down"" and the ""offending only ended with the intervention of third parties"".
Mr Polley pointed to Trafford's troubled upbringing in a broken home which set him off on the wrong path in life, leaving home at the age of 14 before turning to a life abusing alcohol and drugs.
He said his client remembered little of the night in question and was both horrified and surprised watching the video.
Trafford wrote a letter expressing his remorse to the victim and but was resolved to the reality of imprisonment.
Judge Burnett described the attack as a ""most egregious assault"" that was ""short but brutal"" and ""disproportionate"" to any perceived slight.
He described Trafford's behaviour as the ""folly of youth"" with a ""failure to think through consequences"" but said he had good prospects for rehabilitation.
The judge sentenced Trafford to three years imprisonment with a parole date of April 2, 2019 - in nine months time, with no order to pay compensation given Trafford's current unemployment.",www.dailyexaminer.com.au,2018-07-05 00:01:00,18,692284
"Kalpana Raghuram Kalpana Raghuram
Very early in her childhood, Kalpana Raghuraman learnt the importance of bridges as metaphors. Her parents had migrated to the Netherlands from Tamil Nadu before she was born and it was from her mother, Sharadha Raghuraman, that Kalpana inherited Bharatanatyam, a temple dance form that was strange and new to the landscape of the Netherlands. The challenge was to make the two meet. “To find a place for Indian dance in the Netherlands has not been an easy feat. With people not knowing about classical Indian dance, I have worked hard to create awareness among audiences. I created my own tours, inviting musicians from India to come and educate the audience about classical Indian dance,” says Kalpana, who has researched on “the changing dynamic in knowledge transferal concerning the Bharatanatyam” as part of her studies in cultural anthropology. “After creating a place in the Netherlands as the first professional Bharatanatyam dancer I became more interested in creating my own choreographic voice.” At present, she is touring India and will present an ensemble piece, titled Simeon, in which Bharatanatyam and contemporary movements respond to classical Dutch music by the master, Simeon ten Holt. Simeon features live performances by the Matangi Quartet from the Netherlands and dancers of Kalpana’s group, KalpanArts, and has been brought to Delhi by Hamsadhwani, a cultural non-profit based in Chennai, and IGL. Excerpts from an interview with Kalpana:
The Self and Society
The concept of Simeon is about the individual and society. How does one cope with the societal expectations, pressures and demands? How does an individual hold on to her vision and her values in a world that demands you give it up? And to what extent are we so programmed to follow the group? We live on automatic pilot to such a great extent that it is exhaustion of our inner fire and we are left with no sense of self For me, musical compositions are done in such a way that they really match the concept of the piece.
Hearing Simeon
Simeon ten Holt was a well-known composer in the Netherlands especially, famous for his work, Canto Ostinato. I heard it first when I was in my late teens and loved it. Its repetitive, minimalist nature really sucks you in. At that point I was already curious what it would be like to make a choreography for it. The fact that Canto Ostinato is among the most performed of Holt’s works does not affect me. For me, the composition has its own power and I have my own way of developing it which is not related to its formality.
Finding Her Place
With Dutch contemporary dance scene being so well developed and non-Western aesthetics not having a place in the contemporary dance scene, it has been quite a journey to develop my own choreographic voice. After working on smaller projects, I become part of a dance production house that supported me to develop myself and this created a lot of openings. Now, I have my own dance company, Kalpana Arts Reiminaged, which is the first Indian contemporary dance company that is part of the Dutch mainstream scene. This is extremely exciting and Simeon has done extremely well. We have had packed theatres and really moved audiences all the way through. We are curious to see how the Indian audience will feel about this work.
A scene from her work Simeon A scene from her work Simeon
Her Signature
I use elements and techniques of the forms and develop them in such a way that they create the energy, image or feeling I am looking for. So, content is dominating and the dance form is a tool, a method to express this content. I am interested in how art can express or reflect societal concerns as am I interested in empowering people to follow their vision and live develop their potential. An artist is not there to maintain the status quo, she is there to show something different, something nobody has seen yet. If in that process people will not like what is being shown, that is their good right. But, if we worry about this, we will lose for we will not allow our vision to go beyond this reality. Nobody changed the world by being the same.
Recent Ideas
In a recent work, Rebels’ Cross, I speak about the power of being different, and that it is the rebels of the world that can inspire us all to create our own path and life. Another work, Satyagraha, is part of a larger project – an opera of Philip Glass. It is about vulnerability and presence being a stronger catalyst for change than resistance. The next work I am preparing is Superhuman: Our Inner Darkness, which deals with the dark side of the superhero and the existential question of what is good, what is bad, and who is the judge of that?

"(Left) Farmer Rameejabi; porter Amar Singh (Left) Farmer Rameejabi; porter Amar Singh
Amar Singh, a migrant from Rajasthan, earns a living by carrying loads for spice trading companies in Old Delhi’s Gadodia Market, Asia’s largest spice market located in Khari Baoli. But on Sunday, his day off, he emerges clean shaven and bathed. It’s this look that Pakistani-American photographer Sarah K Khan captures in her exhibition ‘In/Visible: Portraits of Farmers and Spice Porters, India’, with 13 frames, curated by Grace Aneiza Ali, at New York University’s Kimmel Windows Galleries.
Khan has been photographing the market since 2001, when she first came to India as a Fulbright Scholar. But it was only in 2014 that she got to know some of the porters closely. They started inviting her for meals on Sundays, when they could afford to relax. The photographs, six-feet high, show the men striking their best poses, they are seen dyeing their hair with henna, shaving, cooking, and talking on the phone.
“Migrants populate the market for jobs. The reasons for migration are many and Old Delhi and Khari Baoli overflow with much migrant diversity. I want to highlight that most migrants anywhere work hard to make a living, with dignity, and I wanted to capture those moments,” she says, who has studied public health and nutrition at University of Columbia. The idea came from several sources over time — food, healing, family, and people such as farmers, cooks, laborers, migrants, immigrants, who grow, cook and manage the food we eat.
The exhibition isn’t her only connection to Old Delhi, her father’s family migrated from the area during Partition. “My grandfather, among other things, was a hakim. My father’s family then migrated to the US. I consider myself partitioned once, migrated twice. In these especially xenophobic times, a hatred for the ‘other’ and the immigrant is unconscionable,” she says, “The source of flavour and taste, this centre of spices in Delhi motivated me as did knowing that my father and his family walked these
same streets.”
A part of the exhibition also has portraits of women farmers who Khan met during her travels in the Indian hinterlands. She had received another Fulbright scholarship to research and document women farmers in 2014, and then she worked with Mirasi caste singers in Rajasthan, Siddi women farmers in Karnataka, women rice farmers in Nagaland, Adivasis in Telangana, millet processors in Andhra, and women street vendors in Delhi.
“The women I engaged with were knowledgeable about local cultures, paid astute attention their environment, resources, and training. They were seed savers, growers of crops, foragers, hunters, and food processors, and culinary experts. All of them struck a chord with me. There are 95 million women farmers in India, their informal labour and their extraordinary contributions are undervalued,” she says. The show ends in September.

"The healing of a paralytic
1 SHARES Share Tweet
Gospel Reading: Mt 9:1-8
After entering a boat, Jesus made the crossing, and came into his own town. And there people brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Courage, child, your sins are forgiven.” At that, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming.” Jesus knew what they were thinking, and said, “Why do you harbor evil thoughts? Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’? But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins” – he then said to the paralytic, “Rise, pick up your stretcher, and go home.” He rose and went home. When the crowds saw this they were struck with awe and glorified God who had given such authority to men.
Reflections
Authority on earth to forgive sins
On the one hand, we are edified by the love and concern that his friends show the paralytic, doing the unthinkable just to get him to Jesus. On the other hand, Jesus wants to show the religious authorities present that he has as much power to heal the “spiritual” ailment of the paralytic as to cure his “physical” infirmity. And Jesus seems to imply that doing one also means doing the other. Spiritual health and physical well-being go together.
We sometimes see how people show great concern and love for those in dire need, even if they do not know them, and do not pay attention to protocol or rules to follow. For them, what is of utmost importance is the well-being, the “salvation” of the person. But, alas, there are others who focus more on rules and laws. Jesus reminds us, the Sabbath is made for man, not the other way around.

Former pro Harold Arboleda put on a flawless shooting as host Parañaque City turned back Cebu City, 81-73, on Tuesday night for its second straight victory in the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League Anta Datu Cup at the Olivarez Gym.
The 6-foot-2 Arboleda, who had a brief stint with NLEX in the pro ranks, sizzled with a career-high 26 points, making all of his seven attempts, including five triples, on top of 11 rebounds and six assists as the Patriots gained a share of the South Division lead.
San Beda product Ryusei Koga added 21 points, spiked by three triples, while backup guard Robin Roño tallied seven points and five rebounds for Parañaque, which trailed by as many as 15 points early on but turned things around in the second quarter before it outplayed Cebu City in the decisive half.
Also getting the job done were the Pampanga Lanterns, who survived the Bacoor Strikers, 81-80, earlier.
Juneric Baloria, back in his former team’s homecourt, sizzled with 24 points, highlighted by three triples, while unheralded Karlo Pangilinan added 12 points as the Lanterns overcame the absence of former pro Jimbo Aquino and Michael Juico for their breakthrough victory.
Forward Gab Banal finished with 21 points and eight rebounds while Chris Sumalinog added 17 points and Mikee Reyes had 16 points for the Strikers, who led by as many as 10 points in the first period but could not sustain their fiery start, leading to their first loss after two matches.
Journeyman Patrick Cabahug also waxed hot with 29 points while Far Eastern University stalwart Cesar Catli added 16 points that all went for naught with the Sharks’ second consecutive setback.

“It's 2.5km in so every dive is roughly four hours when you're away from the nearest breathing gap. And that comes after a two-hour climb and wrestle with all the gear.”
“We were looking for a few days for a T junction, which we couldn’t find, there's a lot of dead ends there, it's a big labyrinth, it's 9km long. There was an old French map, 30 years old, that seemed to be quite accurate.”
“There's a British dry cave geologist that told us 'listen, you have to go there, drop down, otherwise you won’t find it, go left.''
Mr Reymenants said he would never have gone so deep unless it was to save people.
“I’m usually called for the bodies, never for live people, to recover from wrecks or caves, 12 kids with their whole lives in front of them, it puts a bit of pressure,” he said.
Because of the difficulty of the dive, medical experts have advised against the 12 schoolboys and their coach diving out.
“When they came back out, they said right, this is a bit beyond these kids’ capacities,” Mr Reymenants said.
""Teaching someone to dive, in tropical shallow waters, that's quite easy but this is pitch black, bad visibility, cave, like I said, small tunnels.""
The last thing you want is a panicking diver in a cave, they would not survive that.""
For now, Mr Reymenants says the boys are safe, with hope remaining they can be floated out with favourable weather.
“This room, it stays dry the entire monsoon, so fortunately safe, but yes how safe can you keep a kid in a dark room for three months?”
“If the water drops another two metres they can probably float them out with life jackets and there's only one or two places they’d have to make a little dip dive or, the kids actually claim they heard birds and chickens nearby.”
Mr Reymenants says the operation is huge, with 5000 people on site and teams working to lay cables down to the team.
“We're not allowed to film inside but it's a huge operation, there are American, Australian teams,” he said.",www.tvnz.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,16,85482
"A report has found law firm Russell McVeagh had a culture involving “excessive drinking” and at times involving “crude, drunken and sexually inappropriate behaviour”.
Source: 1 NEWS
The external review by Dame Margaret Bazley was investigating complaints of sexual harassment and inappropriate sexual conduct by five female clerks who were employed by the law firm during the summer of 2015-2016.
The report outlined the alleged incidents which include a male partner trying to kiss and touch four clerks at a Christmas party. The male partner and another male solicitor were also accused of inappropriate sexual conduct at two other events in following weeks.
Dame Margaret Bazely says Russel McVeagh failed to investigate the incidents and the firm “did not establish what happened to whom” and “did not understand the gravity of the situation”.
She says the initial response was so rushed it resulted in matters not being resolved when the clerks went back to university, causing “a great deal of ongoing confusion, anger and frustration” for the clerks.
The poor management of the complaints led to serious consequences for the people involved and the clerks losing faith in the legal profession.
The investigation also uncovered “grossly obscene” behaviour by another male partner who has since left the firm.
Dame Margaret Bazely says those incidents often happened in front of others and people would laugh or not say anything due to the seniority of the partner.
The report described a firm that does not have a “speak out” culture as purported and numerous lawyers and staff were frightened and felt powerless in the face of atrocious behaviour.
The investigation also received reports of bullying, sexism against women and inappropriate consensual relationships.
“I was told of atrocious behaviour by the small group of offending partners: yelling, swearing, rudeness, and sarcasm... belittling and disempowering behaviours,” Dame Margaret Bazely says.
She says bullying is in pockets of the firm and this was not acceptable.
The report was highly critical of the management saying no-one in Wellington was in charge and the firm’s HR director lacked appropriate expertise to deal with the complaints. She says the chief executive, the board and the partnership should all shoulder some responsibility for the failings.
Dame Margaret Bazely says the firm had a strong ‘work hard, play hard’ culture and missed warning signs leading up to the incidents, including exit interviews from women who say they left the team concerned about drinking and “cultural issues”.
Both the male partner and solicitor left the firm after the incidents though the partner continued to work with Russell McVeagh in certain cases. This is despite the firm giving the impression to the summer clerks and the country’s top law schools that all work with the former partner had stopped.
The report says it was a “lack of judgement” to continue work with the partner.
Russell McVeagh says it is “deeply sorry” for the impact the 2015/2016 incidents had on the clerks. It says it made some “serious mistakes” and it is “dismayed it did not know many of the things affecting our people”.
The report has made over 40 recommendations which include more training, better policies in place and auditing.",www.tvnz.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,22,85328
"An emergency medicine specialist and toxicologist says road-side drug testing is a good idea in New Zealand - but that current spit tests would likely miss two of our biggest killers.
Scotland has this week announced it will introduce road-side drug testing of drivers this year, prompting some to ask whether it's time for New Zealand to follow suit.
Dr Paul Quigley, speaking this morning to TVNZ 1's Breakfast programme, said drug testing is a good idea, but that current technology is lacking and would likely miss things like synthetic cannabis and prescription drugs.
""We're very concerned at the level of impaired drivers on the road from drugs,"" Dr Quigley said.
""It's all very well going down the road, but if you've got these drugs on board, you lose your ability to react quickly.""
Dr Quigley said that prescription medicines are necessities from day-to-day for many people, and that alternative transport options such as subsidised taxis or improved access to public transport should be considered and encouraged.
Road-side drug tests would ""give the police a tool"", he said, but that tool would need to be used as part of a wider approach to drug impairment.
""If you have a road-side test it only picks up a very few drugs, with cannabis being the most common one detected ... it can pick up the amphetamines as well and the drugs known as opiates - morphine, heroin, fentanyl and so on.
""But it won't detect synthetic cannabis - and we know that is a major problem on our roads at the moment.",www.tvnz.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,9,85568
"British counterterrorism police were investigating after two people were left in critical condition, exposed to an unknown substance a few miles from where a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent.
The Wiltshire Police force declared a ""major incident"" after a man and a woman in their 40s were hospitalised after being found unconscious Saturday at a residential building in Amesbury, 13 kilometers from Salisbury, where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned on March 4.
London's Metropolitan Police force said ""given the recent events in Salisbury,"" counterterrorism officers were working with local police on the investigation. British media reported that samples of the mystery substance had been sent to the Portdon Down defense research laboratory for testing.

Police cordoned off a home and other places the two people visited before falling ill, including a nearby church and a pharmacy, but health officials said there was not believed to be a wider risk to the public.
A major incident is a designation allowing British authorities to mobilize more than one emergency agency.
The emergency services' response echoes that in the case of the Skripals, whose illness initially baffled doctors after they were found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury. Scientists at Porton Down concluded they had been poisoned with Novichok, a type of nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Britain accuses Russia of poisoning the Skripals, a claim Moscow strongly denies. The poisoning sparked a Cold War-style diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West, including the expulsion of hundreds of diplomats from both sides.
The two Amesbury victims were being treated at Salisbury District Hospital, where the Skripals spent weeks in critical condition.
Police said authorities initially believed the latest victims might have taken a contaminated batch of heroin or crack cocaine.
""However, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident,"" police said in a statement. ""At this stage, it is not yet clear if a crime has been committed.""
Sergei Skripal, 67, is a former Russian intelligence officer who was convicted of spying for Britain before coming to the U.K. as part of a 2010 prisoner swap. He had been living quietly in Salisbury, a cathedral city 145 kilometers southwest of London, when he was struck down along with his 33-year-old daughter Yulia, who was visiting him.
Residents of the street at the center of the Amesbury investigation — in a quiet neighborhood of newly built houses and apartments — said they had received little information about the unknown substance from authorities.
""Amesbury's a lovely place — it's very quiet, uneventful,"" said Rosemary Northing, who lives a couple of hundred yards (meters) away from the cordoned-off building. ""So for this to happen, and the media response and the uncertainty, it's unsettling.""
Neighbors said police cars and fire engines descended on the home late Saturday. Student Chloe Edwards said she saw people in ""green suits"" — like those worn by forensics officers — and her family was told to stay inside their home for several hours.
""We wanted to know what happened. And with the Russian attack happening not long ago, we just assumed the worst,"" said Edwards.
Among the sites cordoned off was a Baptist church where the victims attended a community event on Saturday. Church secretary Roy Collins said about 200 people were at the neighborhood event, but ""nobody else has suffered any ill-effects.""
Police from 40 departments in England and Wales had just returned home in June after months of working on the Skripals' poisoning. Wiltshire Police spent about 7.5 million pounds ($10 million) dealing with the aftermath of the Skripals' poisoning and believe that his front door was contaminated with the nerve agent.
Doctors who treated the Skripals say they have made a remarkable recovery but they still don't know what the long-term prognosis is.",www.tvnz.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,29,85178
"Caroline Wozniacki complained about the flying insects at Wimbledon, demanding that bug spray be brought to the court.

Source: Getty
She wondered aloud whether play should be halted because of a brief drizzle.
And the No. 2-seeded Wozniacki was not exactly gracious in defeat after staving off five match points, but not the sixth, in what became a 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 loss to 35th-ranked Ekaterina Makarova of Russia in the second round at the All England Club today.
The reigning Australian Open champion's latest lackluster showing at Wimbledon made her the fifth top-eight seeded woman to exit by the end of Day 3.
Wozniacki said Makarova ""got a little lucky"" and added, ""I would be very surprised if you saw her go far.""
Asked what she thought of those remarks, Makarova laughed and replied: ""Well, I don't know what to say. Yeah, maybe I was lucky today. Good for me. Thanks, God.""
While both Williams sisters moved into the third round, as did past US Open runners-up Madison Keys and Karolina Pliskova, among the women, and Roger Federer won 35 consecutive points on his serve while extending his Wimbledon set streak to 26 in a row, it was Wozniacki's departure that counted as the closest thing to big news on Wednesday.
She is a former No. 1 who recently claimed her first Grand Slam title. She won a grass-court tuneup tournament last weekend.
She had managed to convince herself this was going to be her year to shine at the All England Club, the only major where she's never been past the fourth round.
In addition to her title on the hard courts in Australia, she's twice been the runner-up on that surface at the US Open, and she's been a quarterfinalist twice on the French Open's red clay.
But a game that is principally predicated on defence can be harder to make work on the speedy grass, where Makarova produced twice as many winners today, 46-23.
""It's frustrating,"" Wozniacki said, ""because I feel like I could have gone and done something really great here.""
Instead, it's the fourth time in the past seven years that she's out in the first or second round.
She almost put together quite a comeback, though.
After trailing 5-1 in the third set, Wozniacki broke twice when Makarova served for the match.
The second time, at 5-3, Makarova was within a point of victory four times, but was unable to convert, wasting one of those opportunities with a double-fault.
Once Wozniacki pulled even in the last set by holding at love, Makarova gave herself a bit of a talking-to.
""At 5-all, I said to myself: 'OK, calm down. Start over,'"" recounted Makarova, a former top-10 player who twice has been a major semifinalist and got to the Wimbledon quarterfinals in 2014.
From deuce in that game, she picked up six of the last seven points.
Earlier in the match, Wozniacki was buggin' out about the bugs that also showed up last year at the tournament. She insisted that something needed to be done about them.
Makarova, too, called the scene ""a little bit strange and different"" and ""a little bit uncomfortable.""
That word also described how Makarova's left-handed game made Wozniacki feel.
""I had a chance today. I fought all I had. I'm out. That's it,"" said Wozniacki, who actually won more total points, 94-91.
""It's life sometimes. You just have to keep working and come back. And hopefully next time, luck will be on my side.""
All that really matters, of course, is who wins the last point, something five-time champion Venus Williams did after a poor start for the second round in a row.
Once again, she dropped the opening set. And once again, she dominated the rest of the way, this time beating 141st-ranked qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru of Romania 4-6, 6-0, 6-1.
At 38, Williams was the oldest woman in the field, but she is now into the third round a year after getting to the final.",www.tvnz.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,42,85237

After scores were level at 1-1 after extra time at Spartak Stadium in Moscow – it was England who cemented their spot in the World Cup quarter-finals after winning 4-3 on penalties.
But the outspoken Argentinian claims that the US referee Mark Geiger was biased towards England and said skipper Harry Kane dived for a penalty which earned his side a 1-0 lead in the match.
""I saw a monumental theft. I apologise to all the Colombia people, but they must know the players are not to blame,"" Maradona told Venezuela TV station Telesur.
Maradona infamously knocked out England at the 1986 World Cup with his 'Hand of God' goal – one of the most controversial act in the tournament's history.
""It is the man who decides who the referee is who is to blame,"" Maradona said of Pierluigi Collina, the chairman of FIFA's referees committee.
""A man like that (Geiger) should not be put in charge of a game of that magnitude. With all due respect, Pierluigi Collina, as the man who designates the referees, he is very bad. He must apologise to the Colombian people.
""I told (FIFA president) Gianni Infantino that, if I worked for FIFA, I would change everything. It has to be transparent. That's why I didn't go there.
""The referee will know a lot about baseball, but he has no idea about football. The Colombian players asked for VAR (Video Assistant Referee intervention) and he did not give it to them.

But not because Arrow denied his State of Origin inspiration Jarrod Wallace a Maroons starting front-row spot to get it.
The 22-year-old will make his Origin starting debut when he runs out in the jersey made famous by the likes of Shane Webcke in Wednesday's game three.
It will be bittersweet for Arrow, who earns a front-row start while the man who inspired his Origin quest - Gold Coast Titans teammate Wallace - has been relegated from prop to the bench.
Arrow felt for Wallace but admitted it would be strange to don the great Maroons No.8 jersey after such a meteoric rise.
Arrow - who has played only 38 NRL games - will start for Queensland in just his third Origin.
""To be honest I didn't think I would play one game of NRL. To be pulling on the No.8 jersey will be weird but very exciting,"" Arrow said.
""Shane Webcke was a great for the Maroons. Knowing he has put on the jersey, I don't want to let anyone down.""
Arrow stood up for Wallace, who copped plenty of flack for failing to crack 50m in the first two games this series.
""He copped a bit of criticism over the last few weeks for his Origin games but he has put the team first (in the games) and that's what you want,"" Arrow said of Wallace.
""He went back to club level and showed what he can do. He has come out firing.
""I think he has played his best footy the last couple of weeks after all the criticism he has copped.""
Wallace inspired then Brisbane teammate Arrow to strive for higher honours when the prop left the Broncos for a regular start with the Gold Coast last year.
Wallace not only nailed down a Titans front-row berth last season, he used it to earn an Origin debut.
Arrow followed his lead, leaving Brisbane this year to join Wallace at the Titans - and now the Maroons.
""J-Wal (Wallace) is a great mate of mine and he was the first to congratulate me when we found out the team,"" Arrow said.
""He's been a leader at the Titans. There have been a few games where I have been a bit battered and bruised and he is always the first to grab me, slap me in the face and tell me to 'get up, we got a game, we got to win today'.""",www.tvnz.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,22,85350
"Retail New Zealand says banks and credit card companies are charging Kiwi retailers much more for contactless and 'Paywave' transactions than other countries - and it is pushing up the price of goods for everyone.
The organisation says it has heard of retailers in New Zealand being charged up to 3.5 per cent transaction fees, with an average of 1.6 per cent - the average in the UK is 0.2 per cent.
Greg Harford, speaking this morning to TVNZ 1's Breakfast programme, said the fees largely come from banks charging each other fees, which are passed on to consumers, but also that credit card companies are playing a part as well.
""New Zealand is one of the few countries in the world where credit card interchange fees are not regulated - so there's no government regulation around how much the banks and card companies are allowed to charge,"" Mr Harford said.
""Much of the cost involved in merchant fees results from the banks charging each other for the transaction - so much of it rests with the banks, but the credit card companies obviously also have a role to play as well.
""Both Visa and Mastercard have moved, over recent months, to lower some of the fees that banks can charge each other ... we haven't yet seen that flow through into what's happening in the [New Zealand] market, though.""
Mr Harford says that, because retailers incorporate contactless transaction fees into the price of their goods and services, even those who don't use contactless payment are essentially paying for it.
""The costs of these transactions are all wrapped up into the costs of good and services that we buy,"" he said.
""It makes the costs of goods and services more expensive for everyone in New Zealand, even if you're paying by cash.
""Consumers certainly love the convenience of contactless technology - it's faster to make a payment, it allows you to use Apple Pay and similar applications on your phone as well, but it does come at a really big cost for the merchants and ultimately every retailer needs to make its own call as to whether the value and the speed of transactions outweighs the cost.",www.tvnz.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,10,84961

"The first recorded sighting of a southern right whale in the capital in eight years has given researchers a chance to learn more about the species.
NIWA marine ecologist Dr Kim Goetz collected sound recordings near the curious mammal in the hopes it made vocalising calls that can be linked to unique calls recorded in the Cook Strait from around a year ago.
Being able to see the southern right whale provides the evidence necessary to link the calls together if they are found to be the same, providing further understanding of the species distribution.
""Then we would be able to document presence without actually seeing them,"" she said.
It was the first time Dr Goetz has got so close to the species, previously only studying them from helicopters.
""It was very different to a lot of whales. It didn’t seem bothered by us. It was hanging out at the surface quite a bit and just really surface active.""
The encounter became a little too close for comfort when the whale breached and landed near the boat.
""All the water came at us so it got its last laugh really so the jokes on us so it was a really cool experience but at some point it actually can be really dangerous,"" she said.
""We tried to back off at this point.. it didn’t seem to be aggressive but it just seemed to be more curious than anything.""
The species was common in the Wellington area before being driven to the verge of extinction due to whaling in the 18th century.
The Department of Conservation states on its website the mammal was deemed the ‘right’ whale to hunt as they were easy to approach, lived close to the shoreline and provided large amounts of meat, oil and whalebone. Adults can reach 18 metres in length.
Dr Goetz said vocal calls believed to be from the species shows they may be returning to the area, but this was the first she had viewed.
DOC states that southern right whales spotted around the country appear to be part of the New Zealand subantarctic population, with one study showing numbers are increasing.
Colin Giddy, DOC biodiversity ranger for the Kapiti-Wellington region, was also on the research vessel and collected a DNA sample which will be used to determine the whale’s gender.
""Really exciting. This is the first time I’ve had an encounter with a southern right whale,"" he said.
He said it was a ""little scary"" when the whale breached close to the boat but the experience was something he will remember for a long time.
""It’s not a common event.""
The whale's arrival this week comes just a couple of days after fishermen came across an even rarer white-pigmented humpback whale of the coast of Gisborne on June 30.

"Their skinny faces illuminated by a flashlight, the Thai soccer teammates stranded for nearly two weeks in a partly flooded cave said in a video released Wednesday (overnight NZT) that they were healthy, as heavy rains forecast for later this week threatened to complicate plans to safely extract the boys.
The 12 boys and their coach are seen in the video sitting with Thai navy SEALs in the dark cave. The boys, many wrapped in foil warming blankets, take turns introducing themselves, pressing their hands together in a traditional Thai greeting and saying their names and that they are healthy.
The video, lasting about a minute, was recorded sometime Tuesday (yesterday NZT) and was posted on the navy SEAL Facebook page. The navy later released two more videos of the boys.
The boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach disappeared after they went exploring in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in northern Chiang Rai province after a soccer game June 23.
The teammates, who were trapped inside when heavy rains flooded the cave, were found by rescue divers Monday night (Tuesday NZT) during a desperate search that drew assistance from experts around the globe.
Authorities said the boys, who had also been shown in a video shot by the British diver who discovered them, were being looked after by seven members of the Thai navy SEALs, including medics, who were staying with them inside the cave. They were mostly in stable condition and have received high-protein drinks.
In all of the videos, the boys appeared in good spirits. In the most recent video, a navy SEAL is shown treating minor cuts on the feet and legs of the boys with antibiotic ointment. Several of the boys are seen smiling as they interact with the navy SEAL, who cracks jokes.
Seeing the boys has boosted the mood of their family members, and officials are working to install an internet cable to the cave so that parents can talk to their children.
Kian Kamluang, whose 16-year-old son, Pornchai, is in the cave, said she had thought there was a 50 percent chance that her son would be found.
""It's like he has been given a new life,"" she said, adding that she'll never let her son go into a cave or near water again.
Those waiting for the boys to come out included a group of students who are friends with some of the boys trapped inside, who sang a song in front of the entrance to show their support.
Several religious figures have also shown up, the most popular being a famous Buddhist monk, Kruba Boonchum, who when he first visited the scene had predicted that the boys would be found this week.
He returned to offer prayers for their safe rescue, and as measure of the respect in which he was held, was allowed access to the cave, which is generally off-limits to outsiders.
SEAL commander Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yookongkaew said that there was no rush to bring the group out of the cave, since they're safe where they are. The current flooding situation means the boys would have to dive, which rescue experts have said could be extremely dangerous.
While efforts to pump out floodwaters are continuing, some Thai officials have indicated that heavy rains forecast for this weekend could force them to decide the boys should swim and dive out using the same complicated route of narrow passageways through which their rescuers entered.
Chiang Rai provincial Governor Narongsak Osatanakorn said Wednesday that the boys have been practicing wearing diving masks and breathing, but he doesn't believe they have attempted any practice dives.
He said it is unknown when an extraction could be attempted, but it is unlikely to be today.
""If it's risky or not safe, we will not proceed yet,"" Narongsak said. ""It has to be 100 percent safe.""
He also said the boys and their coach may not all be extracted at the same time, depending on their health. He said authorities will evaluate their readiness each day and if there is any risk will not proceed.
Authorities said they were still exploring other options, such as scouring the mountainside for other ways into the cave and finding faster ways to pump water from the cave.
Cave rescue experts have said it could be safest to simply supply the boys where they are for now, and wait for the water to go down. That could take months, however, given that Thailand's rainy season typically lasts through October.
Experienced divers are wary of taking out the boys through the dark and dangerous waters still in the cave, especially since they are untrained.
""We are talking kilometers of transport under the water with zero visibility,"" said Claus Rasmusen, a certified cave diving instructor based in Thailand who has been helping Thai SEAL team with logistics. ""It's difficult.""
He said it was awkward, but possible, to teach them minimal skills.",www.tvnz.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,34,85226
"Iran threatens to cut cooperation with nuclear body after Trump move
LONDON: Iran could reduce its co-operation with the UN nuclear watchdog, President Hassan Rouhani told the body´s head on Wednesday, after he warned US.
President Donald Trump of ""consequences"" of fresh sanctions against Iranian oil sales. In May, Trump pulled out of a multinational deal under which sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs to its nuclear programme, verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Washington has since told countries they must stop buying Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face financial measures. ""Iranâ€™s nuclear activities have always been for peaceful purposes, but it is Iran that would decide on its level of cooperation with the IAEA,"" Iranian state news agency IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying after meeting IAEA head Yukiya Amano in Vienna.
""The responsibility for the change of Iran´s cooperation level with the IAEA falls on those who have created this new situation,â€ he added.
Rouhani said earlier in the day Tehran would stand firm against US threats to cut Iranian oil sales. ""The Americans say they want to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero .
It shows they have not thought about its consequences,"" Rouhani was quoted as saying by IRNA. On Tuesday, Rouhani hinted at a threat to disrupt oil shipments from neighbouring countries if Washington tries to cut its exports.
He did not elaborate, but an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander explicitly said on Wednesday Iran would block any exports of crude for the Gulf in retaliation for hostile US action.
""If they want to stop Iranian oil exports, we will not allow any oil shipment to pass through the Strait of Hormuz, Ismail Kowsari was quoted as saying by the Young Journalists Club (YJC) website.
Major-General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds force, in charge of foreign operations for the Revolutionary Guards, said in a letter published on IRNA: ""I kiss your (Rouhani´s) hand for expressing such wise and timely comments, and I am at your service to implement any policy that serves the Islamic Republic.
""""SELF HARM""Rouhani, in Vienna trying to salvage the nuclear deal, said US sanctions were a ""crime and aggression"", and called on European and other governments to stand up to Trump.
""Iran will survive this round of US sanctions as it has survived them before. This US government will not stay in office forever .
But history will judge other nations based on what they do today,"" he said.
Rouhani told reporters that if the remaining signatories - the Europeans Britain, France and Germany as well as China and Russia - can guarantee Iran´s benefits: ""Iran will remain in the nuclear deal without the United States.
""Iran's OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said on the Iranian oil ministry news agency SHANA:""Trumpâ€™s demand that Iranian oil should not be bought, and (his) pressures on European firms at a time when Nigeria and Libya are in crisis, when Venezuela´s oil exports have fallen due to US sanctions, when Saudia's domestic consumption has increased in summer, is nothing but self harm.
""It will increase the prices of oil in the global markets,"" he said.
""At the end it is the American consumer who will pay the price for Mr Trump's policy.
""The European Union, once Iran´s biggest oil importer, has
vowed to keep the 2015 deal alive without the United States by trying to keep Iran´s oil and investment flowing.
But European officials acknowledge that US sanctions make it difficult to give Tehran guarantees.
Foreign ministers from the five remaining signatories will meet Iranian officials in Vienna on Friday to discuss how to keep the accord alive.",www.thenews.com.pk,2018-07-05 00:00:00,24,637407

"Netanyahu tells Europe to get tougher on Iran after France bomb plot
JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Europe on Wednesday to take a harsher stance against Iran after an Iranian diplomat was arrested on suspicion of plotting to attack an Iranian opposition group in France.

"NEW YORK (AP) — Giancarlo Stanton hit a three-run homer, CC Sabathia pitched six effective innings, and the New York Yankees beat the Atlanta Braves 6-2 on Wednesday.
Aaron Judge added his 24th homer of the season in the seventh inning. He's now homered in three of his past four games.
Rookie second baseman Gleyber Torres left the game in the top of the fifth inning because of tightness in his right hip and will be placed on the 10-day disabled list with a right hip strain.
Catcher Kyle Higashioka also homered for the Yankees, becoming the ninth player since 1920 whose first three hits were home runs. Colorado's Trevor Story homered for his first four big league hits on April 4-6, 2016.
Sabathia (6-3) worked out of a couple of jams for the Yankees, who have won six of their past eight after getting swept in three games at Tampa last weekend.
National League East-leading Atlanta loaded the bases with two outs in the first, but the 37-year-old struck out 20-year-old phenom Ronald Acuna Jr. on an 88 mph cutter.
The Braves have lost their past two games.
New York took a 1-0 lead in the second inning on Greg Bird's RBI single off Atlanta starter Julio Teheran (6-6), who lasted just five innings, allowing five hits and five runs. He walked four and struck out 10.
The Yankees got to Teheran again in the third.
With a runner on first and two outs, Aaron Hicks walked. Stanton then fell behind 0-2 before hitting a line drive to the right field bleachers for his 21st homer of the season to make it 4-0.
After retiring the first two batters in the fourth, Teheran fell behind 2-0 against Higashioka before the 30-year-old rookie connected to the left field stands, extending the lead to 5-0.
The Braves cut the deficit to 5-1 on an RBI grounder from Danny Santana with one out in the fifth. Johan Camargo hit his ninth home run of the season with two outs in the sixth that made it 5-2. But Sabathia limited the damage by retiring Dansby Swanson on a grounder to second with a runner aboard.
Atlanta failed to take advantage in the seventh inning against reliever Chad Green when its first two batters reached on a pair of singles. Green then got three fly outs to end the threat.
PUT ME IN COACH
With New York set to play 11 games in 10 days, beginning Friday at Toronto, Yankees manager Aaron Boone said he wanted to be ""greedy"" with Thursday being their only day off, and held Austin Romine out of the starting lineup for the fourth consecutive day. Higashioka started for the fourth straight time behind the plate.
The Yankees have been short-handed at catcher since Romine left the game on June 29 against Boston in the seventh inning because of a tight left hamstring. Gary Sanchez has been on the 10-day disabled list since June 25 because of a strained right groin.
GET OUT AND VOTE
New York has one of the best records in baseball but it only has one player, Aaron Judge, among the eight leading vote getters on the American League squad for the All-Star Game that will be played July 17 at Washington. The starters for the Midsummer Classic will be revealed on Sunday.
Boone believes that Judge, the 2017 Home Run Derby champion, will have company to make the trip to the nation's capital.
""I mean you look around the league — and I haven't looked at the voting lately — but we were actually talking about guys that might make off our team or guys that are certainly on that conversation and we have a number of those players,"" Boone said. ""Hopefully we'll be well represented. We certainly have deserving guys.""
TRAINER'S ROOM
Braves: 1B Freddie Freeman, who was hit by a pitch in the third inning, left the game after the fourth because of a contusion in his right upper arm.
WELCOME BACK
LHP Luiz Gohara, the No. 3 prospect in the Atlanta organization, arrived about 90 minutes before the first pitch after he was called up from Triple-A Gwinnett for the second time this season. RHP Evan Phillips, who threw 2 1/3 innings Tuesday night, was sent down to Triple-A.
UP NEXT
Braves: Max Fried (1-2, 2.55 ERA) starts the opener of a four-game series at NL Central-leading Milwaukee on Thursday. Fried struck out 11 over 6 2/3 scoreless innings in his previous start against St. Louis.
Yankees: Sonny Gray (5-6, 5.44) gets the nod for the first of three games at Toronto as New York heads out on an 11-game, three city trip. Gray has lost his past two starts, giving up 10 runs and 13 hits in nine innings.

Action galore is expected when Kenyans get down to the thrill of night battle at the eighth stop of the IAAF Diamond League meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, tonight.
Olympic 800m bronze medalist Margaret Nyairera and 2013 world 800m champion Eunice Sum need to be at their best to counter South Africa’s Olympic 800m champion Caster Semenya, Olympic 800m silver medalist Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi and America’s Ajee Wilson in 1,500m showdown.
Habitam Alemu of Ethiopia, home-girl Selina Buchel and Britain’s 2014 Commonwealth Games 800m silver medalist Lynsey Sharp are also itching for glory.
But the men’s 5,000m contest will certainly stand out as the night’s showstopper at the Athletissima Meeting in Lausanne.
David Bett, the 2009 World Youth 3,000m silver medalist and younger brother of 2014 Commonwealth Games 10,000m silver medalist Josphat Bett, leads 2015 World Under-18 3,000m Champion Richard Kimunyan, Commonwealth Games Youth 3,00m champion Davies Kiplagat and Collins Cheboi, an IAAF Diamond League speedster, against a quality 5,000m line up inside Stade olympique de la Pontaise.
They will be up against Ethiopia’s world champion Muktar Edris, World Indoor 3,000m silver medalist Selemon Barega, another Ethiopian, as well as America’s Olympic silver medalist Paul Chelimo.

Barega, at just 18 years old, cannot be ruled out. He won the two mile race in Eugene in May and then triumphed in 5000m in Stockholm with a world-leading 13:04.05. He followed it with a world-leading clocking of 7:37.53 in the 3000m in Ostrava.
Norway’s Henrik Ingebrigtsen looks highly likely to improve his 5000m personal best of 13:16.97 battling strong challenge from countrymen Edris and Barega.
Africa 800m silver medalist Winny Chebet and Emily Cherotich have a mountain to climb against Semenya 1500m race –the contest that brings back memories of 2009 Africa Junior Championships in Mauritius when the South Africa beat Chebet, then a student at Kiptere Secondary School in Kericho County.
Meanwhile world 5,000m champion Hellen Obiri and Ethiopia’s Genzebe Dibaba will square it out in 5000m at the Meeting International Mohammed VI D’Athletisme de Rabat, the ninth stop of the 2018 IAAF Diamond League, on 13 July.
Dibaba, the world record holder at 1500m and Olympic silver medalist over the distance, is also the fifth fastest of all time in 5,000m with a 14:15.41 personal best from 2015.
Obiri is the Olympic silver medallist and world champion at 5000m, whose 14:18.37 lifetime best, from 2017, ranks her eighth fastest of all time.

Less than six years ago, Thika United was seen as one the clubs that would take the SportPesa Premier League by storm.
Boasting a young squad that included Gor Mahia’s Francis Kahata, the team rarely finished below top five in league standings.
However, the club is now a shadow of its old self, mostly due to financial challenges and worst still, they lost eight first team players during the June transfer window.
Last season, the Brookside Dairy-sponsored side barely survived relegation and remained in top flight football after overcoming Ushuru in a two-match play-offs.
The loss of their first team players, coming just two months after former head coach Nicholas Muyoti resigned, may have hit the club where it hurts most.
Former team captain Dennis Odhiambo, who served the club for close to seven years, led the mass exodus after joining Sofapaka.

Eugene Mukangula, a key striker with a knack for goals, joined AFC Leopards. Others who left are; Said Tsuma, Christopher Oruchum, Saad Musa (AFC Leopards), Masakidi Kabemba (Kakamega Homeboyz), Hansel Ochieng (Nzoia Sugar) and Samuel Mwanje (Posta Rangers).
In a bid to beef up his squad, Thika’s coach John Njogu signed 10 new players, but mostly from the lower division league. The team lost 2-0 to Ulinzi Stars at the weekend and is now 16th on the log with 19 points from 21 rounds of matches.
Chemelil Sugar were also dealt a blow after 11 players left the club. Those who left terminated their contracts citing lack of payment.
Yusuf Juma, Benjamin Okech and John Kuol are some of the players who ditched the club.
Chemelil Sugar have drafted their former coach Francis Barasa. League leaders Gor Mahia signed one player and were the least active club in the transfer window. After letting go of Meddie Kagere, who joined Simba, the league champions signed Burundian Francis Mustafa as his replacement.

Unlike many governors, Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has barely worked. He is, to say the least, under siege and this, because of factors ranging from labour disputes to legal suits and political machinations at the county assembly.

The audit he ordered on the 7,000 plus employees bore no fruit. Salaries and wages gobble up 70 per cent of Nakuru’s Sh9.8 billion (2015-2016) Treasury allocations.
He could claim that he inherited the problem from the former regime headed by Kinuthia Mbugua, now the State House Comptroller. That narrative cannot sell forever.
At times, it is tempting to see him as someone who does not want to confront the issues; that he is bidding his time. That is wrong.

Two weeks ago, the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) launched its new policy and criteria for sharing revenue among marginalised counties. The Equalisation Fund is a creation of the Constitution under Article 204. Money in the Equalisation Fund is public finance set aside to accelerate the level of services in marginalised areas to bring them up to par with the rest of the country. In truth, these people don’t just feel left behind. They are behind in many ways. From social development to infrastructure and the fund as its name suggests, would have equalised the region. Alas, that is at risk now.
Oddly, this fund has never taken off as anticipated despite allocations by the CRA. It was only in 2016 when President Uhuru Kenyatta announced that funds will be ready for disbursement but as of May this year, only slightly over Sh1 billion of the Sh14 billion accumulated over five years had been disbursed for various development projects across the 14 target counties.
ALSO READ: Governors oppose new revenue sharing formula
Being a product of the Constitution, the fund had been a matter of intense debate during the constitution making process. A group of members of MPs from the mainly arid parts of Kenya tabled the need for anchoring the Equalisation Fund in the Constitution. The initial idea was the fund should make up at least 5 per cent of the national budget.
African Socialism
However, after long negotiations, the bargain realised 0.5 per cent of the audited account of the collected revenue. The bottom-line is the Equalisation Fund came as result of intensive lobby by members of parliament from counties which were historically underserved.
The fund basically was meant to give a redress on the negative consequences of the Sessional Paper no. 10, entitled African Socialism and its application to planning in Kenya. In this policy paper, the mostly Northern Arid Districts then were considered less potential and hence very little investment from the Kenya Government in terms of infrastructure and development of human capital. This deliberate policy of marginalisation led to exclusion of the Northern Kenya people from benefiting from Government development projects.

The fund was therefore intended for large scale projects that were expected to bring the arid lands at par with the so called ‘potential areas’ of the previously white highlands during the colonial days. This revenue is meant to be distributed among Counties that have sizeable areas that are classified as marginalised. Therefore the redefinition of the word marginalisation to imply poverty by scores of people makes the whole idea of equalization fund a mockery.
In the first place, the plan of the second CRA policy to distribute the funds among close to 1,400 locations and over a hundred constituencies makes the administration and the management of the funds complicated and in the end it would have been better to disburse the funds directly to the counties and make it part of the devolved funds. What made the fund unique initially was the relatively limited number of counties that were beneficiaries of the fund.
Small amounts
The substance and intention of creating the fund was for the purpose of undertaking larger infrastructural projects to equalise the less developed areas. The second criteria seems to be targeting poverty as per the data used to justify the revision of the policy.
ALSO READ: Dam tragedy will ebb away
Fighting poverty is of course a noble idea but in this policy it misses the point; targeting pockets of people with small amounts that might not have much impact as far their development is concerned and has no meaning at all for overall equalization and levelling purpose. What is more worrying is the tone of the elected leaders who have lobbied for the change of this policy.
Reading through the Hansard of the National Assembly on matters of the Equalisation Fund, I recently came across the sentiments of an MP, from a county perceived to be a high potential area, on what the devolved funds had achieved for northern Kenya. According to him, poor counties in northern Kenya do not deserve any additional funding since they cannot justify the funds allocated through the shared revenue. Such words coming from leaders who should know better make those who come from the region very worried.
The policy change at CRA might just be a beginning, we could be heading for a much more serious effort by the national government to push the people of northern Kenya further into poverty.

Reports that the Moi Girls High School student might have been assaulted by lesbian colleagues are disheartening. This is according to an internal investigation and another one by Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet).
These investigations found inconsistencies in reports of the incident following interviews with the victim, fellow students and workers at the school. Following the initial reports and the ensuing uproar the school principal Jael Mureithi was forced into early retirement.

The Government ordered demolition of illegal structures near the school and all male teachers and workers and their male relatives in the school at the time of the attack were ordered to submit samples for DNA testing.
One month later the findings have not been made public despite the Government's assurance of a speedy conclusion. We don't want to accept or dispute both the internal investigations and the one by Kuppet, we want to urge the Government to present its findings and DNA results to settle the case on Moi Girls School. The results were scheduled to be released by July 2, 2018.
When the rape claim was first made, what followed is the characteristic knee-jerk reaction that has become synonymous with Kenyans whenever there is tragedy.
It is an indictment of our society. We have become so cynical to the extent that we are quick to condemn without facts. If the two investigations prove true, then it is an indictment on students at the school who knew about the claims of rampant lesbianism at the school, and the victim and her parents who perhaps knew the truth but chose to keep quiet.

Further, it is an indictment of the media for propagating something totally different from what might have happened. Indeed, the media should have done more than merely report the incident.
This is why we want the Government to release the report of the investigations. It owes it to the student, her family, fellow students, the former principal and the male workers and their relatives who were made to undergo DNA tests. According to Nairobi region DCI Nicholas Kamwende a total of 107 samples were collected from suspects.
Finally the Government owes it to the country to let them know what really happened.

The Constitution of Kenya, 2010 chapter 9 on the Executive has very clear provisions on the nomination, election, assumption of office, authority, functions, powers and remuneration of the President, Deputy President and Cabinet Secretaries. The President is the “de jure” Head of State and Head of Government as well as the Commander in Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces.
The relationship between the President, deputy president and Cabinet secretaries is crystal clear. The President is the boss and the buck stops with him. Period. The President can hire and fire Cabinet secretaries. There is no provision for co-presidency or sharing of presidential powers. However, the Jubilee administration is anchored on fallacies and myths that borders on the insane. Here are the fallacies.

It took the genius of the Constitutional Puritanism of Charles Mugane Njonjo to bring sobriety in the land when he stated categorically that “it is a Criminal offence for any person to encompass, imagine, devise or intend the death or deposition of the President…. Furthermore, it is also an offence to express, utter or declare such encompassing, imaginations, devices or intentions by publishing them in print or writing”. There is no provision in the Supreme law that states that the deputy president will take over when the President retires. It is the end of the game and a fresh start for all Kenyans.
Second, Kenyans have been hoodwinked that without the sweat and tears of WSR, Uhuru Kenyatta would not and could not have been the President of Kenya. This is the greatest fallacy in Kenyan history.

How much did Ruto contribute to Uhuru Kenyatta’s election in 2013 and 2017? Let us undertake a forensic political audit. Which building, which cow, which venue, which strategy, which deliverables did Ruto give Kenyatta? Company yes, but who paid the bills. May the audit begin.
Third is the claim that the Kikuyu and Kalenjin are a formidable political force. The two communities have provided all the four presidents since independence and will continue to provide more future presidents. However, their tyranny of numbers is not enough to guarantee prosperity for all the Kenyan people. The August 2017 General Election was nullified by the Supreme Court.
The fresh presidential election October 26, 2017 was boycotted by the successful petitioner Raila Odinga. It took the extra constitutional initiative known as Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), popularly called the “handshake”, for the temperatures to calm down.
Exclusionism in the name of winner-takes-it-all will not and will never guarantee peace to our country. Some form of inclusivity must be envisaged and entrenched for Kenya to prosper. Any other way is no way.

The fourth fallacy is that Ruto is owed some debt by Uhuru Kenyatta. Chinua Achebe, the founding father of modern African literature, in his book ‘Things Fall Apart’ captures this fallacy very well in an early morning encounter between Unoka the father of Okonkwo and his neighbou Okoye.
Poor producer
Okoye was preparing to take the Idemili title, the third highest in the land and a very expensive ceremony that forced him to gather all his resources together, including some 200 cowries Unoka had borrowed from him years back.
Unoka laughed loud and long when he learned of Okoye’s mission and eventually, between fresh outbursts of mirth, he told Okoye: “Look at that wall …..Look at those lines of chalk….Each group represents a debt to someone, and each stroke is 100 cowries. You see, I owe that man 1,000 cowries. But he has not come to wake me up in the morning for it. I will pay you, but not today. Our elders say that the sun will shine on those who stand before it shines on those who kneel under them. I will pay my big debts, first”. Mr Deputy President you will be paid, but not today (2022). Big debts must be paid first. And you know it.
The fifth fallacy is that Ruto is a political genius. The deputy president is a good consumer of political products but a very poor producer of political outputs.
WSR seems to forget that “those whose palm-kernels were cracked for them by a benevolent spirit should not forget to be humble”. There are those who think the DP would rather watch you hurtle down the cliff and then ask belatedly “why did he do it”. The risk of this is that the sheep will break into tumult instead of action when they are needed most.

Concealment of the vicious infighting within the Jubilee party is no longer tenable. Like suppressed anger held too long, there are emotional and psychological effects that at times make one suicidal or murderous.
At this juncture, the murderous nature manifests in the thinly veiled angry ultimatums a faction of aggrieved Rift Valley MPs have directed at those around the president and those favourably predisposed to Raila Odinga; whose camaraderie with the president is the catalyst in Jubilees impending implosion.
ALSO READ: Tuju: No Jubilee parliamentary Group meeting
Indeed, in their moments of agitation, some of the legislators have thrown challenges at the Head of State; demanding he revokes the ‘handshake’ since it presents the clearest danger; insurmountable at that, to the fallacious fait accompli on Jubilees 2022 candidacy for the presidency. But it was a silly thing to do for, apart from William Ruto, none of his belligerent lieutenants stand to lose anything. They picked the wrong fight, at the wrong time and attacked impulsively.
I have no apologies to make for stating that at the moment, William Ruto is hardly anybody’s darling in the wider context; not with what is being attributed to him, rightly or wrongly.
Even those shouting loudest defending an abstract notion on Ruto’s political future, from where I sit, are doing so from the perspective of the goodies due to them if Ruto wins. Loyalty to powerful individuals is dependent on the royalties that accrue from it, nothing else. Thus, anybody intruding on the illusions of grandeur by the cabal around Ruto is an enemy.
Sweetened tea
In the back and forth of accusation and counter accusation between some Rift Valley Members of Parliament and their counterparts from Mount Kenya, concerns by Senator Kipchumba Murkomen that the ordered ‘lifestyle audit’ was targeting a specific individual could be vindicated by utterances made by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i before a parliamentary committee investigating contraband and poisonous sugar on sale in the country.
A while back, Dr Fred Matiang’i informed a resigned nation that tests conducted on the impounded sugar had confirmed traces of mercury in it. For the millions of people who survive on sweetened tea, that was devastating. Because public attention had already been adroitly turned to focus on a specific group of individuals, Matiang’i’s affirmation steeped public anger towards the said individuals. The public was given a target on which to vent its frustrations, and when Industrialisation Cabinet Secretary Adan Mohammed made a contradictory announcement on the sugar, he was instantly vilified. By a twist of fate, Charles Ongwae, his former colleague was arrested over importation of fake fertilizer.
To the public, what more proof than this was there to show that Mohammed was covering up for someone? Fortunately, that wasn’t the case, for Mohammed was right; there was no mercury in the sugar.
Last week before the parliamentary committee on sugar, Matiang’i changed tune and said there was no mercury in the sugar; that he did what he did to alarm Kenyans and stop them from buying bad sugar. That was pedestrian if only because Kenyans don’t have the wherewithal to tell good sugar from bad when both come in identical packages.
ALSO READ: Jubilee to hold make-or-break meeting as temperatures soar
Insincere pledge
Why did Matiang’i resort to perjury? Was he out to fix somebody? Is it ethical for a minister of government to shamelessly lie to the public over such sensitive matters? Wouldn’t that then confirm to the public that the Government is one big fraud; that it has been feeding them lies, say, on the Eurobond, the Standard Gauge Railway, Infrastructural developments and other things the government boasts about that nobody else sees or feels? Kenyans had already come to terms with long tales about laptops for standard one pupils, half a million jobs annually, fully-equipped hospitals, free education and a host other flowery promises Jubilee made just to ascend to power.
Does that also tell us the supposed fight against corruption is a lie to besmirch, perhaps even a ploy to renege on an insincere pledge that weighs heavily on some individuals? While the Mexicans and Colombians have their drug-induced gang wars, we are having our sugar gang wars, except that they are not sweet.
Notably, after an agitated MP from Rift Valley mentioned the name of Muhoho Kenyatta as one of the licensed sugar importers, Matiang’i appeared to run out of steam while Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri went out of his way to exonerate the younger Kenyatta, and even promised investigations on how Muhoho’s name made it to the list of importers that the CS had presented to a parliamentary committee.
After realising they had opened a can of worms; that they could not possibly win a drawn out war against an incumbent president and Central Kenya legislators if push came to shove, belligerent Rift Valley MPs tactfully withdrew, but we are not bamboozled.
There is something Jubilee is not telling Kenyans, but if President Kenyatta stays his course, we will know soon enough. If he balks, the bad guys will have won. Mr president, go ahead and claim some scalps.

The Embu County government says Embu Level 5 Hospital will continue to conduct kidney transplants despite the death of a patient last month.
Governor Martin Wambora said the incident had not dampened doctors' spirits to operate on 30 patients on a waiting list.
On June 21, specialists from the Embu and Moi Teaching and Referral hospitals operated on Anthony Njiru, a teacher at Karurumo Primary School.
He died of complications a few hours later. Speaking for the first time about the sad turn of events, yesterday, Wambora said they would buy modern equipment to transform the hospital into a specialised facility.
Chief Health Officer Grace Kombuthi, who was speaking during Njiru's burial, noted there were 101 patients undergoing dialysis at the hospital.
She urged residents to support the hospital's efforts to become a centre of excellence, adding that the doctors had done their best and it had been everyone's wish that Njiru would recover.

Economic growth punctuated with increasing inequality has continued to define Kenya’s socio-economic narrative.
Having played a critical role in steering the development of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are driven by the principle “leave no one behind”, the Government has another golden opportunity to demonstrate leadership to the world as it co-hosts the Global Disability Summit in July with the UK government in London.
ALSO READ: Jubilee MP goes after randy men
Like in many other areas, Kenya has put in place progressive policy and legal frameworks with the intention of improving lives of Persons with Disability (PWD).
These for instance include Persons with Disabilities Act of 2003 that among other provisions require; adjustments to public buildings to make them accessible, public transport to be made accessible and infrastructure in general to be more accommodating.
There is also the 5 per cent quarter in employment, public appointment and/or election of persons with disabilities provided for both in the Act and the Constitution.
Implementation of these and many other policy and legal frameworks, however, have been weak.

Disability Summit
What, then, is the scale of need? As stakeholders working on disability and the Government convened for the national disability summit on May 22, 2018 ahead of the Global Disability Summit in London, it is now time for us as a country to do some introspection and ask important questions.
Do we really know the number of Kenyan’s living with disability? Do we know where they are?
Are we doing enough to address issues of stigma and discrimination?
ALSO READ: Uhuru rolls out education plan for the disabled
What do we need to do to improve implementation of policy and legal frameworks to improve the lives of our fellow citizens living with disability?
To answer all the questions, we must be able to answer the first one.
It is clear that Kenya lacks current and credible data on disability. The 2009 Census estimated the population of persons with disabilities to be 3.5 per cent of the then national population (1.33 million).
An earlier report by the National Council for Population and Development (NCPD) estimated the number at 4.6 of the population in 2007.
In both cases, the figures are much lower than the 15 percent global estimates by the World Health Organization and the World Bank in 2011.
It is notable that the Ministry of Education in collaboration with Kenya Institute of Special Education (KISE) conducted a survey in 2017 that indicates that 1, 901, 943 children with disabilities are in the school system.
The report pegs the number of those out of school and needing to be in school at 587,289.
Information system
Kenya really needs to do more to improve the lives of PWDs.
At the very minimum, the government and relevant agencies must put in place a reliable, timely and appropriate data and information system that can guarantee regular updates of data on PWD to inform policy formulation, development planning, service delivery and participation of PWDs (including Children with Disabilities) in national development.
Second, the Government must focus on ensuring effective implementation of policy and legal frameworks that aim at improving lives of those with disabilities.
These require adequate resourcing to support implementation as well as investment in social protection mechanisms for people with disabilities.
Third, for the Government to truly achieve the aspirations for Free Primary Education and Free Day Secondary Education and demonstrate commitment to the right to education for all citizens as envisioned in Article 43 of the Constitution, it must ensure that children with disability enjoy equal rights to education.
Education is key to ensuring that persons with disabilities realise their full human potential and enjoy other rights such as the right to work and employment.
Lastly, all stakeholders must put concerted efforts to fight and overcome widespread stigma and discrimination that affect PWDs differently.
Stigma and discrimination lead to humiliating stereotypes and prejudices.

In summary Land agency rules that the land was legally acquired by defence department in 1957.
Long-running dispute has been a source of friction between squatters and soldiers
The 1,600 acres of the disputed Kwa Mbuzi land in Nanyuki belongs to the military, the National Land Commission (NLC) has declared.
The declaration by NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri that the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) are the rightful owners of the land has dashed the hopes of hundreds of squatters who had long laid claim to the expansive land.
ALSO READ: Land brokers invade Elgeyo Marakwet eyeing Sh6.3billion
“The documents we have show that the land belongs to the Department of Defence and its ownership is also gazetted,” said Swazuri.
The commission ruled that the land located near Kanyoni was acquired by the military, which has a title deed, in 1957.
Swazuri, who was speaking yesterday during a meeting that brought together Kwa Mbuzi residents, military representatives and the commission's personnel, dismissed claims that the area was the squatters' ancestral land.
Permanent ownership
The land has been a source of dispute between residents and the millitary for over 60 years, with some locals moving to the courts seeking to be granted permanent ownership.
The long-running wrangling has also been a source of constant friction between the two parties with the residents claiming that the military has always accused them of being a security threat.
The NLC boss said the national government would relocate the squatters to an alternative piece of land but failed to reveal any more details.
The land woes started in 1955 when the colonial government based in Nanyuki issued a notice declaring that livestock should not be allowed into Nanyuki town owing to destruction of flowers meant to decorate the town.
ALSO READ: Swazuri orders 527 Squatter families to vacate land
The District Commissioner further ordered chiefs and their assistants to evict livestock owners and residents from the town.
“I have read the notice that was written by the then colonial administration ordering eviction of livestock and people from the town and the environs but it did not state where the residents would be relocated to,” said Swazuri.
Two years later, the minister for Internal Security and Defence John Kusak issued a gazette notice declaring military forces as the lawful possessors of the land.
“The gazette notice was issued, but it did not recognise that there were people living in that area and the beacons were not put to describe it,” Swazuri said.
He added: “According to the law, the land belongs to the Government and until a de-gazette notice is issued - which has never happened - it is not possible to allocate the land to you. But the county commissioner will help in identifying the original list of the genuine squatters so that they can be allocated another land.""
Buffer zone
According to the Lands Act, public land reserved for security cannot be allocated to the people and soldiers have been using the territory as a buffer zone, Swazuri stated.
ALSO READ: Governors to resolve Nandi- Kisumu border row
The lands boss further declared that the titles acquired by individuals for the same land were null and void, saying that a notice to revoke them would be released in a week’s time.
“You cannot have a title deed for government land and especially not for the defense forces,” he said, urging the department to fence off the property.
The residents were, however, allowed to graze their livestock with permission from the military officials.
Speaking at the event, Governor Ndiritu Muriithi noted that cases of grabbing public land were rampant in Laikipia and accused the Lands office of complicity.
“It is not a wonder to find someone producing a title deed for land meant for public institutions like schools and, somehow, they manage to sell the land with those fake documents,” he said.",www.standardmedia.co.ke,2018-07-05 00:00:00,23,502915

“Such actions aimed at blackmailing teachers and compromising the integrity of our examinations will not be condoned,"" Kipsang said.
His comments also came on the day Maranda Boys High School, in Siaya County, was closed indefinitely after student unrest.
The students were yesterday ordered to leave the school compound by security officers at around 4pm.
County Director of Education Masibo Kitui said they decided to send the students home following the tension that had been witnessed in the school since Tuesday.
""We got reports that the students had even printed posters expressing dissatisfaction with the administration,"" said Kitui.
According to the students who spoke to The Standard, the administration is using some rules they are not comfortable with because they are punitive.
""Our time for morning classes has been changed and the food is also not good,"" said one of the students.
The students are calling for the removal of the school's principal who joined the school last year.
This is the second time the school is being closed after fire razed a dormitory some five years ago.
Kyanguli mixed Secondary school, in Kibwezi, Makueni County was also closed yesterday due to students’ indiscipline.
According to Kibwezi sub-county Director of Education Dr. Kennedy Machora and as reported by the school head, students were stealing lab apparatus with the school girls claiming that it was the boys behind the theft.
After the reports were relayed to the teachers, they conducted search in in the boys’ dormitory where the stolen lab apparatus were found but they were puzzled after finding the students in possession of condoms in their boxes, liquor, paraffin in containers, and 20 mobile phones.
Following the confiscation, the form four students went on rampage beating the form ones, and destroying property of unknown value with demand for the collected phones to be returned.
Ngiya Girls High School in Siaya County was also closed indefinitely on Tuesday after students went on the rampage as they demanded the transfer of one of their teachers.
PS Kipsang said the Ministry would support any action preffered by Teachers Service Commission (TSC) against the teachers and students who were found culpable of provoking the criminal attacks in the schools.
Speaking on the Chalbi incident the PS said the attack could have been aimed at expanding on the issue on delocalisation of school management, which he said, would not be reviewed.
“We already made the decision and it is final. We agreed that all teachers shall be available to work in any part of the country and that shall remain,” he emphasised.
PS Kipsang also said there has been substantial improvement in managing unrests in schools which is usually a challenge in the second term.
“We have not had more than 30 cases of unrests with minimal number of fires this year,” he said.
The PS said the Ministry will encourage day schooling which he said has helped in reducing cases of student unrest.

Heads of private and public institutions who share personal data of their employees or clients risk being jailed or paying steep fines, if a bill currently before Senate becomes law.
The Data protection Bill, 2018 seeks to protect personal data from misuse by government and private agencies.
ALSO READ: New fight against State abuse of mobile phones
Sponsored by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, the bill was tabled in the House on Tuesday. It proposes that a person who collects and later discloses personal data has committed a crime.
According to the proposed law, agencies should not collect and process data on a person’s special information, his race and ethnic origin, religious beliefs, political persuasions and health status unless there is a special reason to do so.
“An agency shall not transfer personal data of a data subject outside the territory of the Republic of Kenya, unless the subject consents the transfer and it will be beneficial to the subject,” say the bill.
The outlawing of sharing of personal information comes months after it was reported that data belonging to millions of Facebook users in the country was collected by a British firm and used to influence the last election.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in April admitted that indeed Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm in question, had access to data belonging to millions of users of the popular social media platform.
In the bill, Mr Moi wants a new commission that will ensure that agencies adhere to data law created. Among other duties, the commission will receive complaints on violation of data and adjudicate over such disputes.
“A person who collects and processes data in any manner that is contrary to the provisions of this act commits an offence and is liable, upon conviction, to a fine not exceeding Sh500,000 or a jail term not exceeding five years,” reads the bill.
“Where an offence has been committed by a body corporate with the consent or connivance of or to be attributed to any neglect on the part of any director, manager or secretary, that person as well as the body corporate shall be guilty of that offence,” adds the bill.

The ethanol in question was part of the 64 containers worth Sh288 million that EACC by then stated had been imported by unlicensed excise manufacturers.
In 2016, the ethanol and contraband sugar worth Sh56 million had been impounded and EACC officials said they were investigating 11 companies and 33 individuals in connection to simultaneous smuggling of illegal goods through country's porous borders.

Under a sarcastic hashtag on Twitter, the bloggers 'congratulated' the legislators for fulfilling their 2017 pledges while encouraging them to go on with their 2022 General Election campaigns.
Murkomen described his attackers as 'political hirelings' by senior officials in the Office of the President who were against Ruto’s bid.
“A group of bloggers who worked for us in the last elections and attached to one of the officers I alluded to recently are now offering 'congratulatory' messages to Kuria, Kangata, Ichungwa, Nyoro, myself among others,” tweeted Murkomen.
One Twitterati wrote: “These our amazing waheshimiwas like @KimaniIchungwa, @HonMoses_Kuria and @kipmurkomen deserve medals and a pay rise for completing their work early. All that is left for them is to go around politicking about 2022.”

The MPs targeted in the online campaigns are perceived to be close allies of Ruto and have been going around with him, pushing his political ambitions.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has in the past said his agenda at the moment was to deliver on healthcare, housing, manufacturing and food security.
Murkomen recently claimed a wing of individuals at State House were out to scuttle Ruto’s bid.
The latest pointer that things are not well in the Jubilee house comes barely two days after the ruling coalition cancelled a parliamentary group meeting that was to be chaired by Uhuru at State House on Tuesday.

Kisumu governor Anyang’ Nyong’o
In summary All payments to the government will now be made using mobile phone money transfer.
System, however, faces challenges, as some residents lack phones
The Kisumu county government has introduced a cashless revenue collection system as it fights to meet its revenue targets.
The government had been struggling to meet its Sh1 billion revenue target over the past five years.
ALSO READ: County on spot over Sh50m office renovation plan
Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o attributed poor collection of revenue to corruption among officials in the revenue office and cartels he said were running parallel systems.
He said the digital system would seal loopholes through which revenues were lost, thereby improving collections.
Nyong’o said the automated system would also edge out cartels that had been eating into the county government by running parallel ticketing.
He said poor record keeping and lack of accountability had also contributed to the revenue challenges.

In an executive order dated July 1, County Secretary Olang’o Onudi directed the 10 departments to migrate revenue collection to the new system that would use mobile money transfer.
The county has secured an M-Pesa paybill number through which all payments will be made.
“We are moving towards a cashless revenue collection system to curb widespread pilferage in the regular ticketing,” said Aloice Ager, the county's communication director.
He said the system was recommended by a task-force instituted by the governor when he assumed office last year, as part of efforts to shore up revenue.

The governor said the bold move was a strategic step towards elimination of parallel ticketing that would also eliminate cartels.
Some of the revenue streams these cartels have infiltrated are bus parks, markets and kiosks.
A spot check by The Standard revealed how residents were struggling to adapt to the system.
In hospitals, for example, several patients were at a loss after they were asked to pay for medical cards and medication via mobile money.
Many, especially women and the elderly, came with Sh30 at hand, and some did not have phones.
Hospital managers, who sought anonymity, said they allowed them to get medication as they liaised with the county government on how to deal with such cases.

“We are already facing many challenges. These people have not been told about the cashless payment for services and so they came with cash. Others do not even own phones,” said a medical superintendent.
On Monday night, a 21-year-old-man bled for nearly an hour at a public hospital after he was denied emergency services over the Sh30 fee.
Steve Austin Juma waited as a Good Samaritan who had taken him to Ahero sub-county hospital sought help from friends to send him the Sh30 on mobile money so he could pay for the services.

Kiringara Girls School parents' representatives have denied claims that a student was sexually assaulted at the institution.
Speaking at the school in Central Imenti, the Parent Teachers Association (PTA) members led by Chairman Daniel Kinoti blamed the student and her mother for instigating a claim against to tarnish the school.

The girl has claimed in a report to the police that over three hooded attackers drugged and sexually assaulted her on last week's Thursday night after drugging her after she woke to answer a call of nature then abandoned her naked in another dormitory in the school.
“We had a whole day meeting at the school and find no merit in the claim by the student,” said Kinoti. “We also find that all this was all instigated so that the student can be allowed to transfer from the school.”
The eight members of the 16 member board also laid several accusations against the student and her parent.
They claimed her version to the police and the media differed sharply with the information she had given to the school principal and medics at the Meru Level 5 hospital.
“The student had confessed earlier to her classmates that she has been having a recurrent infection in her private parts and she inserted a piece of toilet paper to mop up the discharge,” said board member Gideon kithinji.
The PTA members also claimed that the parent of the girl had confessed that the infection had recurred after an initial treatment in the first term and blamed her for taking time to arrive at the school after being summoned by the school management to accompany the daughter to hospital.
James Barongo another PTA member said they had full confidence in the school management and had found all students were calm and contented when they arrived for the meeting.
“We have done our own investigations including talking to the children and found no truth in the allegation by the alleged victim,” said Mary Karaine. “As a matter of fact, the other students disowned their counterpart as having concocted a story for her selfish interests.
ALSO READ: Pastor suspected of defiling, impregnating girl, 16, held
Yet another board member claimed that the student had wanted to get an excuse to leave school and attend the graduation party of her cousin.
Githinji said the PTA would investigate whether there was a link between the incident and a scheme by the community surrounding the school and some members of staff to fight the headteacher who was transferred to the school from another in Kajiado County last February in the delocalization drive launched by the Teachers Service Commission (TSC).
But the PTA members confessed they had not talked to the complaining student or her parent but denied going by only the version of the school management.
“Our only interest is to protect our children and we have absolutely no interest in protecting anyone,” said the PTA chairman. “It is only that we find no truth in the claim by the student.”
But they referred mainly to a Post rape incident form which the student claimed were written from the school’s version of the incident as given to doctors at the Meru Level 5 Hospital.
Other PTA members in the meeting were Henry Mawira, Francis Chorogeli, Lucy Mwongera and Ellen Mwirigi.

Kenya cannot afford to take more loans since mega infrastructure projects undertaken by the Government are not making any money to repay debts.
Central Bank Governor Patrick Njoroge said the State had to abandon the model of borrowing and let the private sector drive the economy.
ALSO READ: Cut expenditure to control borrowing, think tank advises the State
“We have less headroom to borrow and we are running out of space. We need to look at public-private partnership and build operate and transfer models,” said Dr Njoroge.
“We have had 15 per cent rise in debt over the past few years but what is the return? In fact it is negative, infrastructure is costing us money. We do not have to look very far, Hambantota port in Sri Lanka is gone,” said Rich Management CEO Aly Khan Satchu.
Break even
Operations at the Standard Gauge Railways will take at least three years before it breaks even, according to Kenya Railways Corporation Managing Director Atanas Maina. And until then the Government is sinking in more money to run it.

“Any business takes about five years to break even and we are targeting three. We want to have a surplus by five years,” said Mr Maina.
He said he could not provide the exact cost-plugging the Government was doing because factors keep changing, citing the number of trains they are running, which will soon grow to seven, as an example.
In energy, Kenya is paying billions of shillings for over-capacity and guarantees to firms for idle plants, including Sh13.9 billion to Lake Turkana Wind Power and Sh37 billion to Lamu Coal-fired plant.
On roads, the Government has realised that the Road Maintenance Levy factored in retail fuel prices has not been adequate to cater for road repairs, and hence use of major trunk roads will attract a fee as the Government sets up toll stations along them.

The three were speaking yesterday at the Moody’s fifth Annual East Africa Summit in Nairobi where the ratings firm pointed out that commercial borrowing has contributed to worsening debt affordability.
“Interest payments take up a larger share of Government revenue in all four East African countries compared with five years ago,” Moodys said in a report.
“The deterioration in debt affordability has been most severe in Kenya; interest on debt took up 19 per cent of revenue in FY 2016/17, up from 11 per cent in FY 2011/12, which was already above the B-rated median,” the ratings agency said.
Despite the clarion call for Public Private Partnerships to deliver the Government’s agenda, Treasury has continued to run huge deficits and targets to borrow Sh562.7 billion in the current financial year.
The debt levels have hit Sh5 trillion and with large repayments pushing interest and redemption to Sh870 billion, including two syndicated loans and the part of the 2014 Eurobonds.
Tipping point
The Government says that debt which is currently 60 per cent of the GDP is still manageable, maintaining that the tipping point is 74 per cent.

“If we are talking about 74 per cent of the GDP are we deluded? We are extremely fortunate that the shilling strengthened because of growth in remittances,” said Mr Satchu.

Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga
In summary It’s not clear why they spoke in non-official language in the House
Debate at the Roads and Infrastructure committee conducted in Kikuyu and English.
Members of staff and journalists were yesterday shocked when part of a session at the Nyeri County Assembly was conducted in mothertongue.
In a departure from the House tradition and against the Standing Orders, debate at the Roads and Infrastructure committee oscillated between Kikuyu and English to the surprise of those following the proceedings.
ALSO READ: Leader opposes Sh196m allocation to legal department
It is still not clear why members of the committee were allowed to speak in a language not recognised in the House, and how the proceedings were to be documented in the Hansard in such a form.
At one point Dedan Kimathi MCA Gibson Wahinya questioned the county executive for roads Muthui Kariuki in Kikuyu, while demanding an explanation on why 20 wards would not benefit from the two-kilometre murraming programme.
“Ni tutige kurituhia maundu, malorry macio matiraruta wira, nige mukurihia atia kilometre 1 millioni 1.5 na murrum itaiuma oguku kaunti? (Let us stop complicating issues. Those lorries are not working. How can we pay Sh1.5 million to put gravel one kilometre, yet the murram is being sourced from our county?” asked Wahinya.

As the debate generated heat, the Roads committee chair Clement Warutere tried to intervene, but fell into the same trap when he told Wahinya in vernacular to stick to either Kiswahili or English.
“Riu tiga kwaria Gikuyu committee-ini, Aria na githungu kana githweri. (Now stop using Kikuyu in the committee proceedings, use either English or Kiswahili,” he told Wahinya, to the amusement of many.
During the session, proceedings nearly turned chaotic when assembly members considered friends of the committee took over the session to demand answers from the CEC.
Majority Whip Watson Weru had to seek the intervention of the chair to help quell tempers.

“I would like members who do not belong to this committee to recognise that as friends of the committee, you should be directing your questions through the chairperson. Please follow procedure,” Mr Warutere pleaded.
While the sitting proceeded, it emerged that road equipment purchased in 2014 by the previous government at a cost of Sh110 million were no longer working, forcing the county to hire machinery from the national Government for the road works.
The road repair equipment, which included four graders, two excavators, one roller and one low loader, had broken down, most of them being beyond repair.
Inherited machinery
“As your committee knows, the equipment we inherited from the previous government were in bad shape. Actually, we had to fix two of the graders, while we hired the rest of the equipment from Public Works Department,” Muthui said.
He told the assembly that the county had an agreement with National government’s Public Works Department to hire equipment at a cost of Sh27 million to build at least two kilometres of murram road per ward.
Deputy Speaker Samuel Kariuki insisted the county should purchase its own equipment.

The controversy surrounding construction of Huduma Centres has deepened after Kisumu County set aside Sh40 million for the project in the 2018-2019 budget.
This is the third time the project, whose implementation has stalled, is being allocated money.
ALSO READ: Nyongo in trouble as workers decline to sign termination letters
The allocations have been raising questions because Huduma Centres are under the national government.
In the 2017-2018 budget, Sh97.5 million was set aside to construct and equip three Huduma Centres. Money had also been set aside for the centres the previous financial year.
The proposal was greeted with criticism from activists and residents who accused the county government of wasting public resources to duplicate national government projects.
Huduma Centres are part of the national government's Vision 2030 flagships projects.
In its 2015-2016 budget, the former regime allocated Sh50 million for construction of what it termed documentation centres in Nyando, Muhoroni, Kisumu East, Kisumu West and Nyakach sub-counties.
And when Governor Anyang’ Nyong'o took over, he continued with the same trend and now there are fears the project may not take off after rights activists threatened to move to court to stop implementation of the entire budget.
Allocations to the project have been inconsistent over the years with Nyongo’s regime reducing its kitty by about Sh20 million.
In the current plans, the county government plans to spend about Sh10 million on each Huduma Centre in Nyakach, Nyando and Muhoroni.

Officials defended the project, saying it will bring services closer to the people.

Under the directive, Kansagara will be charged with manslaughter. Others to be charged alongside him are general manager of the Patel Coffee Estates Limited Vinoj Jaya Kumar, water rights officer at Warma Winnie Muthoni Mutisya and the agency’s sub-county regional manager Tonkin Odo Odhiambo.

Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong will spend two nights in a police cell, pending determination of his bail application.
Mr Ojaamong became the first sitting governor to face corruption charges.

The county chief was accused of conspiracy to defraud the county government of Sh8 million, engaging in projects without proper planning and abuse of office.
The governor presented himself to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission but ended up being detained.
The decision to lock him up followed a long-day court appearance where he denied the charges.
Prosecutors Alexander Muteti and Victor Owiti opposed their bail application, arguing that they would interfere with witnesses and scare the junior officers who have recorded statements.
According to the prosecution, demonstrations in Busia to protest the governor’s prosecution were an indication that he would put the lives of investigating officers and other officials at risk.
But his lawyer James Orengo dismissed the claims, arguing that there were no compelling reasons to warrant denying bail.
“What example are we sending to Kenyans that every time they come to court they have to beg to be released on bail when the Constitution is clear that bail is a fundamental right and part of fair trial,” said Mr Orengo who is also Siaya Senator.
He said he was disappointed by the Director of Public Prosecution’s habit of opposing bail applications even in instances where accused persons had shown good character by cooperating with investigators and presenting themselves to police.
ALSO READ: Governor Ojaamong arrested
According to the lawmaker, the cases have been under investigation since 2014 when Ojaamong was in office and he would have already interfered with the witnesses if he feared the cases had any truth.
Pleas by his lawyers to have him released failed.
“There are voluminous submissions made by the parties which I need to consider before making a comprehensive decision to release him on bail or not,” said Chief Magistrate Daniel Ogoti.
“He will therefore be remanded alongside the other accused persons at the anti-corruption commission police cells until Friday,” he added.
Ojaamong was charged alongside Finance Executive Bernard Yaite, Chief Finance Officer Leonard Obimbira and head of treasury accounting Samuel Ombui.
In the first count, the four were accused of conspiring to defraud the Busia county government of Sh8 million by entering into an agreement for a feasibility study on solid waste management.
The study was to be done by Madam R Enterprises Limited yet the company’s services had not been properly secured, according to the charge sheet.

Monson, who was the heir to Monson baronetcy, died at Diani Palm Hospital where police officers from Diani Police Station had brought him chained. He had been being detained at the police station on claims he had smoked marijuana.
Police told a Kwale court he had died of drug overdose. A fresh investigation into the matter revealed otherwise, instead implicating officers and leading to Justice Ogola's order for the new charges.

The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) obtained the records disclosing the properties Muhammad Swazuri and Abigael Mbagaya held in 2013 before they assumed office to determine the growth, if any, in their wealth portfolio and whether there were unexplained assets.

EACC wants to use the disclosures in an investigation into claims the duo took bribes to influence compensation of land owners whose property was acquired by the Government to construct the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR)
National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi - who chairs the Powers and Privileges Committee - forwarded the forms to the EACC.
Mr Muturi said the forms were certified as true copies of the original and thus could be used in court when required.
“(Swazuri and Mbagaya were) informed of this matter and they agreed that (the forms) be handed to the commission. We gave them the forms after the legal department gave us the go-ahead to do so as there was no harm in it,” he said.
EACC made the request four months ago, according to the speaker.
EACC Investigations Director Abdi Mohamud said the probe would be conducted according to the law.
“The forms will only be used for furthering our investigation. There is no witch-hunt in this at all,” said Mr Mohamud.
He added that the commission needed the documents to compare with the ones it has. EACC had raided the homes of the two in search of evidence. The search, Mohamud said, was done after the commission obtained a court order.

“The investigations have come out of a complaint received by the commission in 2017. The complaint surrounds the SGR land acquired either from private or public entities. The petitioner alleges that bribes were received and in order to confirm or deny this we must go through these forms,” he added.
Last year Mugo Njeru - in a petition to Parliament seeking the removal of Swazuri - told MPs that Prof Swazuri, through Elijah Fadhili Yaa together with lawyer S. Ruwa, allegedly coerced him to pay the bribe in order not to miss out on the compensation.
Muturi said all forms regarding the wealth of all State officers, including the President and the Deputy President, were in the custody of Parliament.
He assured the officials that the documents were under lock and key and could only be released when a formal request was made.
“Should the documents be needed in a court of law, they are admissible as they are certified as true copies of the original,” said Muturi.
“This is the first time that we have received such a request,” he added.

Dandora dumpsite in Nairobi
In summary
City Hall now says the there is no space to set up another waste-yard to replace one condemned 20 years ago.
Plans to relocate Dandora dumpsite have ground to a halt due to unavailability of land.
The site was declared full 20 years ago and attempts by City Hall to relocate it to an alternative land have hit a snag.
ALSO READ: Has Zimmerman Estate converted to a dumpsite?
County environment executive, Larry Wambua, yesterday told The Standard that City Hall had now settled on setting up an energy generating plant at the dumpsite.
“We do not have land in Nairobi to host it, the only place we have right now is Dandora. There is technology that can fit in the dumpsite to set up an energy generation plant,” he said.
Initially, City Hall had planned a 500-acre dumpsite at Ruai. But the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) opposed the move, saying the new site lay beneath a flight path.
The agency argued that birds attracted by the waste would interfere with flight operations.
City Hall was then sent back to the drawing board and resorted to compacting waste at Dandora dumpsite to create space for more garbage.
Mr Wambua now says that approximately 60 local and international firms had expresed interest in setting up of an energy generating plant at the 43-acre dumpsite.
The plant is expected to produce 40MW per hour from methane gas generated from waste.
The ground breaking and awarding of the contract is expected to take place by December this year.

Proposal requests
Expressions of interest have already closed and the county is in the process of completing requests for proposals.
According to Wambua, viable companies would be shortlisted and meetings initiated to determine energy generating technologies on offer and the firms’ seriousness in the project.
The City has been grappling with a waste management crisis for decades now, which has seen piles of garbage accumulating on some streets and in some estates.
Nairobi produces up to 2,500 tonnes of waste everyday.
Out of this, the city is only able to collect 1,800 tonnes. This presents a shortfall of 700 tonnes that City Hall says it has scaled up efforts to collect.

“We have also declared every first Saturday of the month a cleaning day to keep the city clean,” he added.
City Hall has also increased the fleet of garbage collection vehicles to 80 and devolved the service to wards for ease of operations.
Last month, Governor Mike Sonko announced that contracts for firms hired to clean up the City and transport the waste to the Dandora dumpsite had expired.
The governor announced that the Sh700 million previously used to pay garbage collection contracts would be used to pay youths to do the job.",www.standardmedia.co.ke,2018-07-05 00:00:00,24,502967

“The irregularities and illegalities the appellant has said were not demonstrated and proved in the superior court as required by law,” said Kilonzo.
He said the appeal filed by Timami lacked merit and ought to be dismissed because the appellant failed to tender evidence worth being used in nullifying the election of Twaha as Lamu governor.

Patient had a clot which the doctors successfully removed.
The Kapenguria County Referral Hospital marked a major milestone after doctors conducted the first brain surgery.
The procedure was done on a 21-year-old patient who was involved in a road accident on Friday last week in Makutano township.

According to the lead consultant surgeon Karuri Maina, the five-hour operation was performed on Marvin Odhiambo by a team of 12 specialists from the county.
The man had been hit from behind by a lorry while riding on a boda boda on his way home. He was admitted to the referral hospital before being transferred to Kitale for a CT scan.
The patient was examined by a doctor who recommended surgery. The medics in Kapenguria then requested for the patient to be taken back to the facility for the procedure.
Dr Karuri noted that the patient was out of danger and was recuperating well at the hospital.
“When the patient was brought to hospital, he was bleeding a lot and there was a clot in the brain. We had no option but to conduct brain surgery, which turned out to be successful,” he said.
Odhiambo’s father, Mr Ibrahim Matende, said that after the accident he lost hope his son would survive because he was unable to walk, talk or eat.
“I am delighted to see my son recognising people and responding positively to treatment. We thank the team of 12 doctors who conducted the surgery on Monday night,” said Matende.
Karuri encouraged patients to visit the hospital because it offered superior heath services. He, however, observed there was need to improve on the facility’s human resources.
He also advised local leaders to avoid politicising health matters, saying that they could only improve facilities in the referral hospital if they were united.
Governor John Lonyangapuo, who led medics and other county officials on a tour of the hospital, hailed the successful surgery and pledged that the county would spend more on health to ensure similar milestones are achieved in future.
The governor praised devolution as a success story in marginalised counties and urged the national government to grant counties more funds to enable doctors further their studies and sharpen their skills.",www.standardmedia.co.ke,2018-07-05 00:00:00,20,502942

The Government lost Sh36 billion in taxes during the duty-free window for sugar imports last year.
The amount is enough to fund free education for three financial years.
ALSO READ: New taxes on selfies, preachers and mutura
Apart from the Government losing taxes, some importers took advantage of the period and shipped in 90 blocks of narcotic substances.
Treasury had issued a gazette notice 4536 allowing the importation of duty free sugar between October and December last year, following prolonged drought in sugar growing zones.
The gazette notice did not specify the quality or quantity of sugar to be shipped into the country. It also allowed everyone, including unlicensed firms, to do the importation.
It is through this window that Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) now admits that it lost up to Sh36.4 billion in taxes.

More revelations will be made today when the joint committee of Agriculture and Trade tables a report on the floor of the House this afternoon following a six-day probe.
According to KRA, 113 large importers shipped in 818,151 metric tonnes of duty free brown sugar into the country. 13 small scale traders imported 185 metric tonnes.
Kenya Revenue Authority Director General John Njiraini told the MPs that investigations into whether narcotic substances were included in the imports were going on.
Suspected narcotics
ALSO READ: Bankers challenge new tax on transactions
He told the committee that four suspected unsealed polypropylene bags were found concealed inside bags of sugar imported by a company registered in Uganda.
“The 90 blocks suspected to be narcotics were marked as exhibits and packed in evidence bags and detained by the Anti-Narcotics Police Unit. Currently the matter is being handled by the relevant government agency,” said Mr Njiraini.
The Taxman also told the committee that raw cane sugar imported under the exemption regime was presented to customs in 50 kilogram bags and in un-bagged bulk carriers.
The KRA boss told the Kanini Kega (Kieni) and Adan Haji (Mandera South)-led committee that the release of any imported sugar was clearance by relevant regulatory authorities.
“In all cases where un-bagged sugar was imported, all regulatory agencies including Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs), Port Health and Radiation Board certified the consignments as fit for importation,” he said.
Exemption deadline
Upon expiry of the initial tax exemption deadline, KRA received requests to facilitate duty free entry of sugar whose arrival was said to have been delayed by various logistical challenges.

Njiraini told the committee that KRA advised the National Treasury of its inability to admit the sugar on duty free basis given the strict timelines.
“KRA intercepted 40,000 metric tonnes of brown sugar purported to have been originated from Brazil and declared to have been loaded within the gazette notice while conducting due diligence to ensure that only sugar that met the requirements specified in the Gazette Notices 4536,” said Njiraini.
He said the authority declined to allow the importation on duty free basis and demanded Sh2.5 billion in taxes.

""It is unfortunate that the Government has decided to frustrate the producers of the country's staple food. It is now over seven months and farmers are still waiting for their dues,"" said David Kipsiya, a farmer from Uasin Gishu.

Kimutai Kolum, another farmer, said most of them had been unable to apply fertiliser to their maize due to lack of funds and expressed concern that the grain's production could decline.
The farmers complained that the delayed payments had made it difficult for them to meet their financial obligations, prompting them to dispose of alternative such as livestock to pay for their children's education.
They accused the Government of turning a blind eye to their plight, saying some top officials were only preoccupied with 2022 succession politics.

Several survivors of the Solai tragedy have said they regret accepting a conditional payout that bars them from pursuing further claims against the owners of the killer dam.
They claimed they were not allowed to study the documents that stated the dam owners would not accept liability despite the payment of Sh100,000 for a life lost, Sh200,000 for semi-permanent structures and Sh1 million for permanent structures destroyed.

The survivors said they were desperate for cash. They were required to sign the documents to receive the money. They said they were surprised to later learn that the documents they had signed were discharge and indemnity forms intended to cushion the dam owner, Mansukh Patel.
Some of those who spoke to The Standard said they were not given time to read through the document they were asked to sign at the office of the Solai assistant county commissioner in the presence of Rongai Deputy County Commissioner Julius Kavita.
Local politicians
Senior Government officials and local politicians supervised the signing of the forms by the survivors of the tragedy that swept three villages including Energy, Nyakinyua and Nyandarua, killing 47 people.

Joseph Gathogo, who lost four children, signed for Sh400,000.
""I signed without reading because there was no time. We were picking up Sh50,000, from the national kitty, when we were also told to sign for the other money from the farm owners,"" said Mr Gathogo.
The survivors had been invited to the office of the assistant county commissioner on June 28, when they were also asked to sign the indemnity form.
""The dischargee herein accepts the said monies, contemplated under clause 4 herein above and further consents that the estate of the said deceased person shall never have any claim against the dischargor herein,"" reads part of the clause in the three-page indemnity form.

Clause 4 in the form states that the settlement was full and final arising from the dischargor's (Kensalt Limited), as gesture of goodwill based on humanitarian grounds.
""The dischargee do hereby recognises that the dischargor has neither legal obligation to make any settlement of whatsoever nature, and that this settlement is being effected by the dischargor purely on humanitarian grounds and that the same shall neither be construed to amount to compensation by the dischargor herein nor shall it whatsoever amount to an admission of liability on the part of the dischargor,"" reads the form.
Gathogo yesterday said had he read the form and understood what it meant, he would not have signed off the deaths of his children for a pittance.
""My children were my treasure. They gave me joy and made me work hard each day,"" said Gathogo.
""I am now hopeless and ashamed that the value of the death of my children was equated to Sh100,000,"" he added.

“I signed for a cheque of Sh100,000 for the death of my wife, but I have yet to sign for Sh200,000 for the house because I feel cheated,” Muna said.

Another survivor, Simon Njenga, who signed Sh1 million for his permanent house, said it was difficult for him to resettle after the loss.
Mr Njenga said his three-bedroom house constructed six years ago was worth Sh2.5 million.
His car was also damaged.

He is among the managers of the farm and top government officials whom the DPP recommended should be charged.
The charges include manslaughter, neglect of official duty and failing to prepare an environmental impact assessment report.
The indemnity agreement between the survivors and Kensalt, on behalf of the dam owners, states that they shall not make any claims and the farm owners are not obligated to make any settlement.
Others who signed the document include Esther Wanjiku, Geoffrey Kahuria, Teresia Njeri, Tabitha Wangechi and David Kimani.

The President together with his deputy, William Ruto, assured those affected that the national government would give the necessary support to help them rebuild their lives.
Subukia MP Samuel Gachobe has asked the Ministry of Interior and National Government to investigate senior government administrators in Nakuru County.
Mr Gachobe said the officials, including the Rift Valley regional coordinator, Mongo Chimwaga, and County Commissioner Joshua Nkanatha, should be probed over last week's payout.
“CS Fred Matiang’i should open up investigations into government officials over the payout issued to the Solai dam survivors last week facilitated by Patel farm owners and overseen by some government officials. Most of the survivors were coerced to sign the documents without a lawyer,” claimed Gachobe.
He said although the two government officials distanced themselves from the agreements, they were privy to the planned payout.
Nkanatha and Chimwaga have distanced themselves from the matter still under investigation, saying they were only privy to the Sh50,000 payment from the Sh1 billion government kitty that was offered to flood victims countrywide.
Gachobe questioned the interests of Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri, whom he claimed had been visiting the survivors.
“I am warning Ngunjiri to stop making political mileage out of the Solai tragedy. The MP comes to my constituency without informing me.
Top officials
“Desperate locals were under duress to sign for the money from Patel,” said the MP.
However, Mr Ngunjiri said the document between the survivors and the Patel farm management was agreed privately and that he had nothing to do with it.
He said he had been helping the survivors, ""just like other wellwishers who stood behind them and marshalled whatever resources they could manage to help"".
“Gachobe should not feel threatened. I went to assist the locals because they needed help and not to gain political mileage,” said the MP.
Signing the discharge and indemnity document means the survivors have forfeit any claims and that Patel is discharged of all responsibilities.
""Once they sign, it means they have no other legal claim against him. Those who agreed to sign cannot go to court,"" said lawyer Wahome Thuku.
Mr Thuku, however, said there were exceptions as the right to life and serious injury cannot be indemnified, unlike lost property. He said one could still sue for lives lost even after signing an indemnity and discharge document.",www.standardmedia.co.ke,2018-07-05 00:00:00,65,503125

The legislator claimed that in the spirit of regional integration, it was illogical to limit the usage of natural resources that member states of the East African Community share.
""We cannot say that we are committed to regional integration and yet we still fight and put limits to usage of resources that can help fast-track our unity,"" Mr Ochanda said

""We want Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, who share the lake, to set aside about 10 nautical miles from their shorelines as buffer zones,"" the MP told The Standard.
This would mean that the countries that share the lake would only claim the 10 nautical miles while the rest would become international waters.
Kenya has only a 6 per cent share of the lake against Uganda's 43 per cent and Tanzania's 51 per cent.

Details of the plan were revealed on Wednesday by Director of Medical Services Jackson Kioko after the meeting at the hospital with county officials and KNH management.
Part of the agreement was that the county budgets for the equipping of all its health centres with the necessary workforce and equipment.
The high number of patients going to KNH, which is meant to be a referral facility, has been blamed on the break-down of devolved health care system.
Dr Kioko said all county hospitals should also start operating round the clock.

“KNH will now be monitoring how many patients it gets and in what status, whether self-referral or hospital referrals,"" he said.
Some of the health centres targeted are in informal settlements like Korogocho, Mathare and Kariobangi.
“We have given ourselves three years to make sure KNH is decongested so that people do not have to queue at the hospital for a service they can easily get within their locality,” said Kioko.
The push to decongest KNH was initiated by Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki, who described it as her very first assignment after taking office early in the year. She launched a team to come up with recommendations.

The electoral body chairman Wafula Chebukati has re-organised the commission’s secretariat in changes affecting six senior managers.
Through communication to the Independent Electoral and Boundary Commission's (IEBC) employees by acting CEO Marjan Hussein Marjan, Chebukati made changes in the Finance, Legal, Human Resource and Supply Chain directorates.

“To ensure that the commission provides effective and efficient delivery of service to stakeholders, the changes have been agreed upon for immediate implementation,” Marjan’s circular dated July 3 reads.
The four directors have been appointed in an acting capacity, in a move likely to raise questions as to whether an acting CEO has powers to appoint. The IEBC Act and HR regulations bestow powers on the CEO to assign duties and responsibilities to staff.
Consequently, Mohamed Osman Hassan who is currently the manager administration will be the new head of human resource directorate. He replaces Irene Mutai who has been acting for over a year following the exit of Celestine Kiuluku, whose contract expired in March last year.
Manager investigations and prosecution Chrispin Owiye will be the new director of legal and public affairs. He replaces Mahamud Jabane who has been acting since October last year, after Praxedes Tororey elected to take an early retirement. It was not clear why Jabane was dropped.
Finance manager Agatha Wahome has been picked to head the finance directorate in place of Osman Hassan Ibrahim who was asked to step aside in line with a presidential directive requiring heads of procurement and accounting units to exit to give way for a lifestyle audit.
Manager warehouse and logistics Bernard Nyachio returns to head the directorate of supply chain, which has been left vacant after another manager (procurement) Milca Chebosis was asked to step aside.
Chebosis had only acted for less than a year after former boss Lawy Aura left but was told by Marjan that the presidential directive affected her as well and she had to leave.
Irene Mutai, who had been acting HR director, was moved from her position as HR manager and re-designated as manager HR development. Her position has been taken by Joseph Ayatta.

The changes come just three months after the National Treasury slammed the brakes on the planned recruitment of senior managers to replace those who either retired or were sacked from the electoral agency.
The Treasury, in a letter to Marjan, said the commission had not obtained relevant approval for the exercise, adding that IEBC had failed to adhere to the requirement that all new recruitment remained frozen as per the Treasury circular No. 2/2018.
Two secretaries, two personal assistants and a messenger were also sent home in unclear circumstances.

The man has been embroiled in a protracted court case of who should bury the woman.
The husband of a woman whose body has been lying in a mortuary for more than a year has been allowed to bury her.
Lydiana Chepng'eno died on June 10 last year at a private hospital in Kisii but a dispute pitting her husband, Jonathan Gwako, against his mother-in-law, Beatrice Chelugut, on who should bury her derailed funeral plans.

Ms Chelugut had appealed a ruling by a lower court on January 19 that said Mr Gwako had superior rights to bury the body.
She argued that the trial magistrate had ruled that Gwako was Ms Chepng'eno's husband although they had not legitimised the marriage.
She faulted the magistrate's ruling that since the two had children together, they were married.
But Gwako, who is an officer with the Prisons Department, said the two started cohabiting in May 2011. He argued that since his employer did not permit officers of different sexes to live together, he committed in writing that they were married.
Gwako added that Chepng'eno had named him and their children as dependents in an insurance policy.
High Court judge David Majanja ruled the fact that there was no customary marriage did not preclude the court from finding that the parties cohabited for a period of time and conducted themselves in such a manner that a marriage could be presumed.
“It is my hope that the relatives can sit down with the respondents and agree to give the deceased a dignified and worthy burial.""

Thuita said he regretted the incident that earned them years in jail and a date with the hangman. He said after losing the appeal, he left the court room and 'met God'.
Quoting Proverbs 28:13, Thuita said he realised the need to be open so that he could be forgiven. He said he had made several attempts while in prison to meet the complainant to ask for forgiveness but was told he had died.

Malawi's President Peter Mutharika initially called the claims ""fake news"". [Getty Images]
There have been mounting calls for the resignation of Malawi's President Peter Mutharika after a leaked report by the country's anti-graft agency accused him of receiving a kickback from a 2.8bn kwacha ($3.9m; £2.8m) contract to supply food to the police.
The report claims a businessman deposited 145m kwacha into an account belonging to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), of which the president is the sole signatory.
ALSO READ: Bungoma wheelbarrow convicts appeal sentence
The president's spokesperson said the claims were ""unfounded"" and that Mr Mutharika had done nothing wrong. Civil rights organisations have nonetheless given him 14 days to resign, or say they will take to the streets.
What did the report say?
The political standoff began after a report by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) leaked onto the internet in the last week of June.
The body has been investigating a Malawi police food supply contract, worth around 2.8bn kwacha, that was awarded to a firm owned by businessman Zameer Karim, called Pioneer Investments.
Avoid becoming a victim of Fake News. Subscribe to the Standard Group SMS service by texting 'NEWS' to 22840.
The report alleges that the head of finance of Malawi's police, Innocent Bottomani, and Mr Karim had ""connived"" to award Pioneer Investment a contract to provide 500,000 food ration packs.
Days after the contract was signed, Pioneer Investment allegedly asked for a change to the agreed price from 2.3bn kwacha to nearly 2.8bn - the report says the change was fraudulently approved by Mr Bottomani.
When Mr Karim was paid for supplying the food ration packs in 2016, he allegedly deposited 145m kwacha into a DPP bank account that is reportedly managed by President Mutharika.
Both Mr Karim and Mr Bottomani have denied involvement in the alleged fraud.
ALSO READ: Democracy needs effective checks and balances
Did the president use the funds?
That is unclear. The president initially called the report ""fake news"" and a ploy by his detractors to scupper his chances at next year's elections.
""I did not personally benefit in any way from the contract and that's why I am concerned about the lack of truth. I am worried about what our country has become in as far as peddling of fake news on social media is concerned,"" President Mutharika told Reuters.
His office later acknowledged the existence of the DPP bank account on 1 July, telling the Malawi newspaper The Daily Times that the account was set up only to support the party's fundraising activities.
Will the president go?
President Mutharika has been defiant in the face of mounting criticism. He told a DPP party congress that he was not running for ""personal gain"".
""I only get 40% from my [monthly] salary of 2.7 million kwacha and the rest goes to government.""

Najin (L) and Fatu are the only two northern white rhino known to be alive today - both are infertile females. [Tony Karumba, AFP]
Months after the death of Sudan, the world's last male northern white rhino, scientists said Wednesday they have grown embryos containing DNA of his kind, hoping to save the subspecies from extinction.
With only two northern white rhino (NWR) known to be alive today -- both infertile females -- the team hopes their breakthrough technique will lead to the re-establishment of a viable NWR breeding population.
""Our goal is to have in three years the first NWR calf born,"" Thomas Hildebrandt, head of reproduction management at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin, told journalists of the work.
""Taking into account 16 months (of) pregnancy, we have a little more than a year to have a successful implantation.""
The team's work, using a recently-patented, two-metre (6.6-foot) egg extraction device, resulted in the first-ever test tube-produced rhino embryos.
Now frozen, these ""have a very high chance to establish a pregnancy once implanted into a surrogate mother,"" said Hildebrandt.
Know if news is factual and true. Text 'NEWS' to 22840 and always receive verified news updates.
The hybrid embryos were created with frozen sperm from dead NWR males and the eggs of southern white rhino (SWR) females, of which there are thousands left on Earth.
The eggs were harvested from rhinos in European zoos.
The team now hopes to use the technique to collect eggs from the last two northern white rhinos -- Najin and Fatu, the daughter and granddaughter of Sudan. They live in a Kenyan national park.
Risk and reward
By fertilising these with northern white rhino sperm and implanting the resulting embryos in surrogate southern white rhino females, the team intends to create a new, fledgling NWR population.
""Our results indicate that ART (assisted reproduction techniques) could be a viable strategy to rescue genes from the iconic, almost extinct, northern white rhinoceros,"" the team wrote in the journal Nature Communications.
The researchers have sought permission to harvest eggs from Najin and Fatu in Kenya, hopefully before the end of the year.
But the procedure is not without risk: ""we have to do a full anaesthesia, the animal is down for two hours, and it is quite a risky situation"" for the last two of their kind, conceded Hildebrandt.
""We are highly afraid something unexpected would happen, that would be a nightmare.""
In the meantime, the team will practice, implanting some of their hybrid embryos into SWR surrogates ""to test the system"".
Any hybrids born as a result may play a crucial future role as surrogates, sharing more genes with northern rhinos than purely southern surrogates.
There is, however, a key obstacle to the team's envisaged NWR repopulation.
With only two NWR females left and all the available semen from only four dead males, ART alone would likely lead to a population without the genetic diversity required for a species to thrive.
Can it work?
To this end, the researchers hope to use stem cell technology to engineer eggs and sperm from the frozen skin cells of 12 dead northern white rhinos, unrelated to one another.
""This would enlarge the founding diversity of the future NWR population substantially,"" the team said in a statement.
There is time pressure, they pointed out, with only two animals still around to socialise the babies in the mysterious ways of northern white rhinos.
""It is a motivating aspect to succeed as soon a possible so the calf that we produce can grow up with Najin and Fatu,"" said Hildebrandt.
Terri Roth and William Swanson of the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, in a comment on the study, said ART alone cannot save a species from extinction.
""Impressive results in a Petri dish don't easily translate into a herd of healthy offspring,"" wrote the duo, not involved in the research.
""Achieving the latter requires navigating an untrodden path fraught with obstacles, and it remains unlikely that a viable population of northern white rhinos will be restored.""
For the researchers, however, a combination of ART and stem cell techniques, could ""provide a blueprint on how to save highly endangered species that have already dwindled to numbers that make conventional conservation efforts impossible.""",www.standardmedia.co.ke,2018-07-05 00:00:00,31,502996

Pheeraphat Sompiengjai's family still have a birthday cake in the fridge waiting for his return home, as the discovery of the missing boy and his football team in a Thai cave brings joy to relatives but despair at the long rescue ahead.

The boys chipped in to buy snacks to take down to the cave to mark his birthday, relatives at Night's village of Vieng Hom said on Wednesday.
They speculated it was those snacks that sustained them during the nine-day ordeal before they were found late Monday huddled in the dark on a muddy bank, flood waters ominously beneath them.
It was meant to be very different, says Night's sister Phunphatsa.
""We prepared dinner to celebrate and some relatives came to join.""

Their village, abutted by rice fields and framed by Northern Thailand's dramatic mountains, is also home to three of the other boys trapped in the cave.
The group still languish inside the cave's 10 kilometre-long passages, with floods blocking their exit, but are now under the care of Thai navy divers and medics.
But fresh rains are forecast and a complex evacuation lies ahead.
The distress was eased a little on Wednesday, when fresh video released by the navy showed the team smiling and looking markedly healthier than when they were found two days ago.

Poland's disputed top judge showed up at work on Wednesday in defiance of a controversial retirement law that the EU has criticised as a threat to the country's judicial independence.
Chanting ""Free courts!"", ""Constitution!"" and ""Irremovable!"" several thousand supporters greeted Supreme Court chief justice Malgorzata Gersdorf as she made her way into the Supreme Court building in central Warsaw.
ALSO READ: Colombia’s fear of killer fans
Gersdorf, 65, has refused to comply with the law change, pushed through by the right-wing government, and insisted she can serve a full six-year term despite being told to step down at midnight on Tuesday.
She has branded the court changes -- which has put Poland's Law and Justice (PiS) government at loggerheads with Brussels -- a ""purge"".
""I'm not engaging in politics. I'm doing this to defend the rule of law and to testify the truth about the line between the constitution and the violation of the constitution,"" Gersdorf told journalists and supporters outside the court.
""I hope that legal order will return to Poland,"" she said.
Poland's anti-communist freedom icon Lech Walesa arrived from Gdansk, northern Poland, to join protesters at the Supreme Court on Wednesday evening.
Walesa, who negotiated a peaceful end to communism in Poland in 1989, told protesters that the current government was ""violating the constitution.""
""If these protest continue, I will come to join you now and then,"" he said.
Twenty-seven of the court's 73 judges are affected by the new law, which lowers the retirement age from 70 to 65. Justices can ask the president to prolong their terms, but he can accept or deny their requests without giving a reason.

Poland's government has pushed ahead with the new rules despite the European Union launching legal action on Monday.
It was the latest salvo in a bitter battle over sweeping judicial changes introduced by the PiS government that could end up in the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the bloc's top tribunal.
""Rape of the Supreme Court,"" thundered an editorial in leading liberal daily Gazeta Wyborcza.
Presidential aide Pawel Mucha insisted that Gersdorf was ""going into retirement in accordance with the law"" and said the court was now headed by Judge Jozef Iwulski, who was chosen by President Andrzej Duda as an interim chief justice.
The government has refused to back down despite the EU legal action, insisting the reforms are needed to tackle corruption and overhaul a judicial system still haunted by the communist era.

""Every EU country has the right to develop its judicial system according to its own traditions,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told a session of the European Parliament.
Critics have warned that the judicial overhaul poses a threat to the separation of powers, a key pillar of democracy in the EU member state.
""Poland is a European country and it is imperative that its judges are completely independent -- this is fundamental to guaranteeing citizens' rights,"" Draginja Nadazdin, director of Amnesty International's Poland bureau told AFP.
""We are calling for the reform to be amended in line with the constitution and European standards.""
For a long time Gersdorf was a member of Walesa's Solidarity trade union that was key to the toppling of communism in Poland in 1989.
'Free and democratic'
She said after showing up for work that she plans to go on holiday from next week, and that Iwulski would be standing in for her during her absence.
""I'm not a replacement for, nor the successor of, the Supreme Court chief justice. I only fill in if she is absent,"" Iwulski said, appearing to contradict the presidential aide.
The European Commission, the bloc's powerful executive arm, said Monday that the court reforms undermine ""the irremovability of judges"" and judicial independence, breaching Poland's obligations under EU law. Poland has a month to respond.

Eating nuts on a regular basis was found to ""significantly"" boost sperm quality and quantity in young men, researchers found. [File, AFP]
Eating nuts ""significantly"" boosted the number and health of sperm in young men in a scientific trial, researchers said Wednesday.
The findings ""support a beneficial role for chronic nut consumption in sperm quality,"" they said, but stressed the study participants were all healthy, apparently fertile men.
The potential benefits of nuts for men struggling with fertility have yet to be probed.
For the study, researchers recruited 119 men aged 18-35, who they divided into two groups.
One group ate 60 grammes of almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts daily on top of their usual ""western-style"" diet, while the second group got no nuts.
After 14 weeks, the nut group ""had significant improvements in their sperm count, vitality, motility (movement) and morphology (shape)"" -- all associated with male fertility, said a statement.
""Moreover, the subjects in the nut group also showed a significant reduction in their levels of sperm DNA fragmentation, a parameter closely associated with male infertility.""
The results were consistent with sperm improvement observed in other studies that looked at diets rich in omega-3, antioxidants such as vitamin C and E, selenium and zinc, and folate.
Nuts are rich in many of these nutrients.
The study results were presented at a meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Barcelona.
Does this mean that men hoping to conceive a child should add nuts to their diet?
""We can't yet say that,"" said study co-author Albert Salas-Huetos of the Rovira i Virgili University in Spain.
""But evidence is accumulating in the literature that healthy lifestyle changes such as following a healthy dietary pattern might help conception -- and of course, nuts are a key component of a Mediterranean healthy diet.""",www.standardmedia.co.ke,2018-07-05 00:00:00,14,503126

The law provides that the budget estimates be tabled before the assembly by June 30, which marks the beginning of a new financial year.

But the county executive committee (CEC) member for finance, Joseph Kiuna, did not table the budget estimates at the assembly last week because the process of public participation had not been completed.
The assembly has accused the executive of failing to adhere to the timelines and said this might see the budget's approval delayed for one month.
Most counties and the national government have tabled budget estimates for the current financial year.
According to the speaker, Joel Kairu, the assembly received the 2018/2019 budget estimates long after the expiry of the timeline.

“We were supposed to carry out public participation and validation of the estimates in April, but due to delays in submission of the documents to the assembly we are now forced to conduct the process this week,” he said.
The speaker said MCAs had yet to debate and pass the county fiscal strategy paper (CIDP), a key component of the budget-making process which was supposed to be submitted before the assembly by February 28.
Pending approval
“MCAs have to first to deal with the CIDP before debating the 2018/2019 estimates. This will take us about a month,” said Mr Kairu.

This means that Governor Lee Kinyanjui’s administration might have to use half of its Sh15 billion budget pending the approval of the 2018/2019 estimates.
This is likely to cause unnecessary delays in development projects. The county did not initiate a single project in the 2017/2018 budget.
Kairu, who last month survived an impeachment motion, yesterday claimed that failing to adhere to stipulated budget timelines was part of the reason MCAs wanted to send him home.
The speaker said members of the budget and appropriations committee had resolved to expedite the process and that any further delays might have legal implications.

""I was a stay-at-home mom and that was my job, and once they started leaving it was getting hard for me,"" says Nancy. ""And then he started getting more busy with work and I guess you would say it felt like we were growing, in distance, apart.""
Frank was away on what Nancy thought was another business trip on the evening of 18 August 2012. She had attended a baptism at her church and after stopping to get a takeaway, she drove back home.
""I drove into my garage and suddenly there was a man with his arm around my neck and a gun to my head,"" says Nancy. He demanded her handbag.

Nancy managed to wrestle herself away and turned to face her attacker, who was wearing a black baseball cap. Terrified, she accidentally handed him the bag of takeaway food.
""He demanded my purse a third time with expletives,"" says Nancy. ""I was close enough to him to shove my purse into his chest and when I did I cried out, 'Jesus save me!' and he immediately shot me in the head and I went down.""
Nancy lay unconscious on the floor while her assailant ran off, taking the handbag but leaving her car, which he could easily have stolen. When she recovered consciousness, Nancy could barely breathe and was in excruciating pain.
The bullet had gone through her head and lodged in her right lung.
""When I came to I thought you're going to die, and then that's when God spoke to me and said, 'Get up.' He gave me the physical strength to get up,"" says Nancy.
Her mobile phone was in her stolen handbag so she crawled to the car and pressed a button designed to summon an emergency rescue service. When this didn't work, Nancy made a huge effort and staggered into the house. Here she caught her reflection in a mirror for the first time.
""I looked at myself and all I could see was blood from my eye down to my beautiful purple shirt,"" says Nancy.

""At that point I didn't realise that I had lost my left eye.""
Struggling for breath, she managed to call the emergency services, screaming ""Help me, help me!"" She told them where she was and provided a description of her attacker. She then miraculously walked to the front door to wait for the paramedics' arrival.
A policeman at the scene contacted Nancy's children who phoned their father Frank.
""He began weeping and being beside himself, as one daughter described it,"" says Nancy. ""And he was out of control trying to get to my rescue.""
Once Frank was able to fly back home, he visited his wife at the hospital. Nancy says her daughter described to her how he fell to the floor before he first saw her, such was his distress.
Yet as the police began to investigate, they found some shocking data on Frank's mobile phone, including photographs and text messages from another woman. Frank had been with her at the time of the attack, and not on a business trip.
The affair had been going on for three years.
When Nancy was strong enough to leave intensive care she received a phone call from Frank via the hospital phone confessing to his adultery.
""I just completely began weeping,"" says Nancy. ""He actually was weeping so hard that I could barely even understand him talking, to tell me what had happened.""

Frank came to visit Nancy at the hospital several more times after that call, but there was more devastating news to come. While she was still recovering from surgery and undergoing further tests, the police told Nancy they had arrested a man in connection with the attack - John Franklin Howard, Nancy's husband, known to everyone as Frank.
For several years, Frank had been paying a gang of criminals to murder his wife.
""It was heartbreaking,"" says Nancy. ""I can remember even after an eye surgery just weeping and weeping and my mother had to come in and say, 'Stop, you can't cry like that, your eye has got to heal,' and, 'You can't be letting your head hang down like that.'""
The criminals had been exploiting Frank, continually demanding more and more money. He was also spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on his girlfriend. So Frank had started to embezzle money from one of his wealthy clients - possibly more than $30m. Frank and Nancy
Nancy does not know why Frank wanted her killed. But she believes it's because he knew she would never agree to a divorce.
""I had made that vow to the Lord that I was not going to divorce him,"" says Nancy. ""So he began getting involved with [another woman], the next thing you know he's embezzling money because he's trying to show her that he's this rich man, and I think before long he was in over his head. He really had no option but to have me shot.""
At Frank's trial, the jury took only two hours to find him guilty of attempted capital murder. He was sentenced to life in prison and will have to serve 30 years before he will be considered for parole. By then he will be about 85 years old.
In fact Nancy did divorce her husband - before the trial - but if he had been acquitted she would have been willing to rebuild their relationship and remarry him, she says.
So the guilty verdict came as a ""kick in the stomach"".
""It's because I still loved him at the time, and you know I have to say I still love him, not in a romantic love, but in a love that he's the father of my children, and there's always going to be a love there,"" Nancy says.
Her children were convinced their father had been wrongly convicted.
""He was continually telling them that he was innocent,"" says Nancy. ""That he had nothing to do with this, and he was a great husband and father until the time he wasn't. So I can totally understand why my children believe this.""
After the verdict she and her children left the courtroom separately. It was a month before they began to make contact again.
Despite everything she has been through, Nancy has been able to forgive her husband - and even offered him forgiveness via her victim impact statement at the trial.
""I have forgiven him,"" says Nancy. ""The Bible says that if we don't forgive those who have harmed us then we are unable to be forgiven and I couldn't afford not to forgive him because I couldn't live with bitterness.""
Nancy has not seen or heard from Frank since he went to prison. Although she has thought about visiting him, for now she is keeping her distance. But there is one question that preys on her mind, and that she would ask him if she could.
""What happened to the marriage?"" says Nancy. ""What in the world even caused him to want to go astray and find another woman? I know the shooting should be the most devastating part of it, but that has been the most devastating part.""
Nancy's recovery has astonished doctors. She has had numerous operations to rebuild her face and eye socket and now has a prosthetic eye. She also has a full-time job working as a legal assistant in a law firm.
""I still have the bullet in my lung, but I had lost the use of my right arm and hand and I now am able to use it and I type,"" says Nancy.
She says she ""vigorously"" celebrates every birthday she has had since the shooting and still experiences joy singing in the church choir. Nearly six years after the horror of the attack on her doorstep, she is moving on.
""I'm able to be thankful once again for how God has saved my life and the healing that's happening in my children's lives, it's awesome,"" she says. ""I'm excruciatingly happy.""",www.standardmedia.co.ke,2018-07-05 00:00:00,91,503049

French fashion icon Jean-Paul Gaultier opened up a new front in the battle over bras Wednesday with ""Free the nipple"" slogans in his Paris haute couture show.
The flamboyant designer showed his support for a Florida teenager who was made to cover her nipples in bandages at her high school for not wearing a bra under her sweatshirt.
Lizzy Martinez, 17, made headlines in April when she said teachers told her to wear a second shirt and put plasters on her nipples after they claimed other students had been distracted by her breasts.
Gaultier said it was a ""scandalous"" that a girl should be treated that way, and used his collection to support her.
He told AFP that if ""men had the right to go bare-chested why not women?""
And to hammer home the point he had a barechested male and female model walk the catwalk, each wearing see-through police visors with the legend, ""Free the nipple"" in French and English.
""You can see the nipples and the jewellery but you can't touch,"" he said.
""I don't say that you must bare your breasts. I am very much for corsets and bras, clearly I like them,"" said the designer who came up with Madonna's famous conical bustiers.
""But a woman should be allowed to not to wear a bra under her T-shirt,"" he added.
Gaultier played with nipple visibility in four other looks in his autumn-winter collection that was a typically playful celebration of liberty and transgression.
""We are living in a quite policed world, and I was looking for a pretext to show freedom for all,"" he said.
""I wanted to show that you can walk around with bare breasts without be attacked or aggressed. It's all about freedom to enjoy yourself and not take life too seriously.""
High-flying Dutchmen
Gaultier also tease convention by using the cigarette -- the number one enemy of health authorities around the world -- as the inspiration for much of his jewellery.
His heavily two-tone black and white show started with a run of ""No smoking"" slogans on jumpers and jackets, which the designer said was a play on ""le smoking"", the French term for a tuxedo.
""We should be free to either smoke or not,"" said Gaultier.
The brilliant Dutch duo Viktor & Rolf celebrated their quarter century together with an all-white collection that showcased their giddy, convention-defying creativity.
""We wanted a clean slate,"" Rolf Snoeren -- the more talkative half of the avant-garde pair -- told AFP backstage afterwards.
And they certainly let their imaginations run riot with a candyfloss tulle dress that looked like some giant had taken bites out of it, a harlequin suit shaped as a heart, and a diamond-encrusted duvet dress that came with its own collar/halo of satin pillows.
If they weren't so futuristic, the ruffed sleeves and accordion pleats worn by some models looked almost Elizabethan, while the huge squeezed exaggerated sleeves on a final silvery white coat made its wearer look like an archangel from the future.
But Snoeren denied that a show-stopping gold-fringed power raincoat with a raised relief breastplate of the word ""No"" had anything to do with the #MeToo.
""If there is any message in the show, it is this,"" he said pointing to ""I love you"" written in elegant script on his white shirt.",www.pulse.ng,2018-07-05 00:00:00,23,240210
"A 92-year-old US woman shot her son dead because he planned to put her in a nursing home when she became ""difficult to live with"", reports said.
Anna Mae Blessing reportedly told her 72-year-old son, ""You took my life, so I'm taking yours"" moments after she gunned him down at their Arizona home.
Blessing, who has been charged with murder, reportedly told police she'd intended to take her own life, too.

The elderly woman was in a wheelchair at her initial court appearance on Tuesday where her bail was set at $US500,000 ($680,000) and a lawyer was being appointed to represent her.

Arizona police said Blessing's 72-year-old son was found dead on Monday at his home in Fountain Hills, located about 50 kilometres northeast of Phoenix.
The man's name wasn't immediately released.
Blessing had been living with her son and his girlfriend for about six months, according to court records, and the elderly woman had reportedly become worried that the pair were plotting to move her into a home.
She told authorities that she argued with her son on Monday morning over the way she was being treated and was upset with him for stating that he was going to put her in a nursing home.
Blessing told police she got out two guns, which she said she has had since the 1970s — one bought at a gun store and the other obtained from her late husband. She told police she hadn't fired either since the 1970s.
She concealed two pistols in the pockets of her bathrobe before confronting her son in his bedroom and firing multiple shots at him with one handgun, records show.
She reportedly turned the gun on her son's 57-year-old girlfriend but after a struggle the woman was able to wrestle it out of her hands.
She also managed to get the second gun away from the 92-year-old.
The unidentified woman called authorities and Blessing was located on a recliner in the home and taken into custody.

When detectives asked her what she thought should happen to her she replied she ""should be put to sleep as a result of her actions"".
Sheriff Paul Penzone said police had been called out to at least one other case of domestic violence involving Blessing and her son but could not give further details.

"A Hastings woman who suffers from Multiple Sclerosis is concerned a pharmacy mix-up with her medication could have been life-threatening, and wants assurances it won't happen to anyone else.
Christine Stark-Botherway has had MS for 10 years and, on a recent visit to a Hawke's Bay Hospital specialist, was given a prescription for steroids.
She said she took it to her usual pharmacy to get filled but they did not have the drug available. After phoning around, the pharmacy told her the only place with the medication was the hospital pharmacy.
""I went to ED - they would not at first let me go to the pharmacy as they did not serve the public, but in the end they told me it was alright.""

A 20-minute wait ensued while the hospital pharmacist investigated her prescription, unsure the correct medication had been prescribed.
""Usually, I take these steroids intravenously, but the doctor decided to give them to me in pill form this time so I wouldn't have to be admitted.""
Eventually, the pharmacist gave her the pills in a bottle, but as she was driving home they rang her to say they had only given her five pills rather than the 25 the prescription was for.
""I went back and they put the pills in another bottle.
""Because I trusted them to get it right, the next morning I took five of the 100mg pills and then looked at the bottle and it said to only take one pill in the morning.
""I got such a shock, and was worried - I rang my normal pharmacy who luckily still had a copy of my prescription and they could confirm that I was right to take the five pills.""
She said she was concerned that such mistakes could potentially cost people's lives, and said she had rung the hospital to tell them what had happened.
""It concerns me that they are doling out tablets with no checks on what the pharmacist is doing - anything could be happening to patients.""
Hawke's Bay District Health Board chief medical and dental officer Dr John Gommas said the hospital sincerely apologised for the labelling error regarding the quantity of medication and directions for use.
He said the error was quickly identified by the dispensing pharmacist and within minutes of the patient leaving the hospital, she was contacted and asked to return.
""At no time was the patient at harm from the medication dosage or quantity dispensed.""
The DHB was also sorry that the patient had the added inconvenience of needing to return to the hospital, but it was important she had the correct quantity of medication.
""The DHB acknowledges that while the pharmacist verbally instructed the patient on the changed dosage, the label was not updated, which created avoidable confusion.""
He said Stark-Botherway had been in contacted regarding her complaint and that the DHB would keep her fully informed on an investigation process that had begun.
This situation followed a case last month when a one-month-old baby was given methadone by mistake at a Hawke's Bay community pharmacy.

"A Westpac bank worker says pressure on staff to sell products means loans are being given to people who can't service them.
The bank strongly rejects the claim and says it has strong credit systems in place to ensure this doesn't happen and the focus for all its employees is to put customers needs first at all times.
Bank sales incentives have been under the spotlight since last year when a report was released in Australia called the Sedgwick report, which made 21 recommendations urging banks to change their focus from sales to service by 2020.
New Zealand's major banks, which are Australian-owned, promised they would review the report and look at implementing the changes.

But research, released by First Union which represents New Zealand bank workers last month, found pressure on staff to sell products to the public remained the same or higher than it was a year ago despite promised changes by their employers.
A survey of 600 bank worker members found 87 per cent of respondents felt pressure to sell financial products and 92 per cent felt the same or more pressure to sell financial products than they did a year ago.
A long-serving Westpac worker, who got in touch with the Herald after seeing a story on the research, said her bank had changed the wording from targeting sales to meeting ""needs"" in September last year but the pressure to sell products had not changed.
The woman, who does not wish to be named for fear of losing her job, said instead of sales, the staff had to meet three ""needs"" a day and staff were emailed weekly about their progress.
The woman said she had never sold a customer something they could not afford but others had.
""I've seen some dreadful loans that never should have been done. Loans where people go into arrears almost as soon as they get them.""
""And it's driven by greed to get that incentive.""
At the same time, the woman said the important functions that bank staff performed for customers were not acknowledged in any way if they did not result in a new product being sold.
""I'm talking about sorting out accounts in arrears, and complex lending restructures requested by customers.
""These take literally hours, then we are asked why we have not sold them life insurance.""
She said the bank was paying lip service to the Sedgwick Report by maintaining pressure on staff to sell products for which customers may not be able to sustain payments on such as expensive life insurance premiums.
""Many trusting customers are sucked in,"" she said.
But a spokeswoman for Westpac said customer service representatives or tellers were not incentivised to sell customers products.
""If a customer wishes to know more about a product they are referred to a customer banking consultant to discuss their requirements.""
She said customer banking consultants were not required to sell specific products each day but to meet the needs of the customer which could include a customer's request for a new savings account, mortgage, personal loan, or any other banking product they are interested in.
""Sales make up only a fifth of their performance measures.""
The spokeswoman said the bank strongly disagreed with the claim that its systems encouraged branch staff to lend irresponsibly.
""Westpac branch staff are trained around their responsible lending obligations, and we have strong credit systems in place to ensure this does not occur.""
She said that was supported by data which showed 1.86 per cent of personal lending and 0.49 per cent of mortgage lending was overdue by 30 days or more as of March 31.
""The focus for all employees is to put customer needs first at all times.""
When it came to insurance the spokeswoman said affordability was taken into account when selling life insurance.
""We do a full needs analysis for all retail life insurance customers and affordability is a consideration in that process.
""Our Westpac Life insurance termination rates are below the industry average. The reality is customer circumstances can change and they may no longer require the insurance they have chosen to initially take out.""
The spokeswoman said it was ahead of the timeline to have the Sedgwick recommendations fully implemented across its network by 2020.
""There is a very high level of commitment to ensuring action is taken on any gaps that may be identified.
""We would encourage any staff who feel they are under pressure to sell to raise the issue with their manager.""",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,32,81870

"A cave explorer assisting Thai authorities trying to rescue 12 trapped schoolboys believes ""we'll know in the next 24 hours"" if they will live or die.
British cave expert Vern Unsworth, who lives in Thailand, said the conditions were getting worse and there was now a narrow window in which the group could escape.
""I think we'll know in the next 24 hours...We'll keep our fingers crossed - everybody needs to pray and hope for a good outcome,"" Mr Unsworth told the BBC.
The boys aged between 11 and 16, along with their football coach, have been trapped in the flooded Tham Luang cave system for 12 days.

But heavy monsoon rain is coming, and Mr Unsworth said rain that had already fallen had caused a dramatic rise in water levels in the cave.
""The main thing is to try to get the children to safety. We have to keep hoping. The water levels are rising, we had a lot of rain overnight.""
He said the temperature of the water was cold, although the air temperature wasn't an issue.
Time is of the essence for rescuers.
The challenge ahead of the group is enormous - none of them are divers and some can't even swim. They have also been weak after spending days without food, but are gaining in strength after being given high-protein drinks.
Authorities insist they won't begin the rescue mission that has gripped the whole world until it was safe to do so. It will be dawn there at about 8.30am AEST.
""We have to be 100 per cent confident that there is no risk to the boys before we evacuate,"" Narongsak Osottanakorn, Chiang Rai provincial governor, told reporters.
""We will take care of them like they are our own children,"" he said. The group are being taught how to use diving masks and breathing apparatus, he added, but from the safety of the muddy bank which for now remains their sanctuary.
Getting out of the cave won't be easy. It will require diving of about a kilometre which could not be completed all at once. In total, it was expected to take three hours.
Another British expert, Gary Mitchell, described the challenging conditions. ""There's air pockets along the way,"" he told the Associated Press.
""It's confined spaces. It's almost zero visibility. There's currents to battle against in places as well. So it's a really quite a strenuous environment to be in.""
Doctors and nurses were seen moving up to the entrance of the flooded cave last night, fuelling speculation that an attempt was imminent.
Medical staff were filmed leaving the staging area further down the slope and were on the move to the mouth of the cave as reports emerged the rescue mission could begin as soon as this morning.
The football team.
The cave system is nearly 2km long.
The Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda said evacuating the boys ""must speed up"" as soon as possible before more rain falls and exacerbates the flooding.
The grim forecast could force authorities to have the children — who cannot swim — out through a narrow, underwater passage in the cave.
""If something happens midway, it could be life-threatening."" Mr Paojinda said.
""Diving is not easy. For people who have never done it, it will be difficult, unlike diving in a swimming pool, because the cave's features have small channels.""
There are a couple of other options on the table if that doesn't work and the heavy rains subside.
Authorities are considering digging them out of the cave, but if this goes wrong it could cause the cavern where the team has taken refuge to cave in.
Rescuers could potentially drain the caves enough to allow the boys to wade or float out with life vests.
The final option is to leave them in there for three or four months until the rains subside is also being considered.
The group of 13, who disappeared when flooding trapped them in the cave they were exploring on June 23 after a soccer game, were found by rescue divers late Monday night in the cavern in northern Chiang Rai province during a desperate search.
The effort drew international help and has riveted Thailand.
Detective Superintendent Thomas Hester said the team of six divers from the Australian Federal Police faced ""incredibly challenging"" conditions.
Rescuers have asked for 15 small and extra small full face masks, leading to speculation that divers were preparing a rescue mission through the 750-metre flooded stretch of the Tham Luang Nang Non cave.
Media have been told it was too dangerous to use conventional breathing apparatus as it could easily be knocked out during the dive.
The boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach were described as healthy and being looked after by seven members of the Thai navy SEALs, including medics, who were staying with them inside the cave. They were mostly in stable condition and have received high-protein drinks.
It has been revealed that the boys visited the cave to attempt a local initiation rite in which they had to scrawl their names on a wall at the end of the tunnel.
While efforts to pump out floodwaters are continuing, it's clear that some areas of the sprawling cavern cannot be drained, said Mr Paojinda, a member of Thailand's ruling military junta.
In order to get them out ahead of the bad weather forecast for later in the week, they might need to use diving gear while being guided by professional divers, he said.
Mr Anupong said the boys would be brought out via the same complicated route through which their rescuers entered, and he conceded that if something went awry, it could be disastrous.
Yesterday, a video released by the Thai navy showed the boys in their soccer uniforms sitting in a dry area inside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave above the water as a light held by a rescuer was shone on their faces.
Cave rescue experts have said it could be safer to simply supply them where they are for now, rather than trying to have the boys dive out. That could take months, however, given that Thailand's rainy season typically lasts through October.
SEAL commander Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yookongkaew said there was no rush to bring them out, since they're safe where they are.
A doctor and a nurse were with them in the cave.
""We have given the boys food, starting from easily digested and high-powered food with enough minerals,"" Arpakorn told a news conference.
Having them dive out of the cave was one of several options being considered, ""but if we are using this plan, we have to be certain that it will work and have to have a drill to make sure that it's 100 per cent safe,"" he said.",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,58,80546

"A review of alleged sexual harassment at law firm Russell McVeagh will be released to the public this morning.
Dame Margaret Bazley was appointed to lead the external review, looking at incidents which occurred through 2015/16.
Alleged incidents include male employees taking part in sexual acts with female intern students who were part of the summer law-clerk programme. There were accusations of a culture of inappropriate sexual behaviour at the firm.
Media have been invited to Russell McVeagh's Wellington headquarters, where the results will be released at 10am this morning.

Russell McVeagh staff will only be formally briefed on the results after the press conference.
The law firm pledged at the outset to give Bazley full access to any material she needed, as well as any staff who wished to participate.
The review will cover sexual harassment claims over the summer of 2015/16, the firm's responses to those claims, as well as any other claims of improper conduct.
Bazley was asked to consider the overall culture of the firm, as well as the firm's standards, systems, and policies for the management of staff.
Former staff and summer clerks were invited to take part.
When the review was announced in March this year, Russell McVeagh chairman Malcolm Crotty said the women who had been subjected to any form of sexual harassment would want to be assured that the review would be thorough.
Russell McVeagh senior partner Pip Greenwood said they were grateful to Dame Margaret for agreeing to conduct the review.
""We recognise that the incidents of sexual harassment that have occurred at our firm have had a profound effect on the women involved and we are all truly sorry and horrified that they occurred.""
At least two staff members from Russell McVeagh left after allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour towards young, female law-clerk students.
Bazley previously headed the Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct in 2007, was a member of the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance, and reviewed the Legal Aid system in 2009.
She also reviewed the Wellington Rugby Football Union process and protocols for player recruitment, and the management and monitoring of player behaviour, in 2016.
All six of New Zealand's law schools have cut ties with Russell McVeagh in the wake of a series of accusations that a culture of sexual harassment was rife within the firm.
In the wake of allegations against the law firm being made public, up to 17 formal complaints of a sexual nature were lodged with the Law Society.
Law Society president Kathryn Beck told Newsroom the 17 allegations had been lodged, with at least one believed to be from a former summer intern.
A spokesman told the Herald they could not give out information relating to a particular complaint or say whether or not they had received any.
""The legislation sets certain parameters and we're obliged to work within that,'' he said.
""That related specifically to confirming whether or not particular complaints have been received.''",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,22,79830

Police say a man and a woman in their 40s were hospitalized after being found unconscious at a residential building in Amesbury. The town is eight miles (13 kilometers) from Salisbury, where ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent on March 4.
Police say they are keeping an open mind and do not yet know whether a crime has been committed.
___
6 a.m.
British police declared a ""major incident"" Wednesday after two people were left in critical condition from exposure to an unknown substance a few miles from where a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent.
The Wiltshire Police force said a man and a woman in their 40s were hospitalized after being found unconscious at a residential building in Amesbury, eight miles (13 kilometers) from Salisbury, where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned on March 4.
Police cordoned off the building and other places the two people visited before falling ill, but health officials said there was not believed to be a wider risk.
The man and woman were hospitalized Saturday at Salisbury District Hospital, where authorities initially believed they might have taken a contaminated batch of heroin or crack cocaine.
""However, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident,"" police said.

"An 88-year-old woman suffering Parkinson's disease was fleeced of $45,000 by a man who has been jailed 82 times.
Damien Hakaraia was sentenced by the Whanganui District Court this week to 22 months' imprisonment on 23 charges of using a document to obtain an advantage.
Judge Dugald Matheson also ordered Hakaraia to pay $7500 reparation costs.
Judge Matheson told the court that Hakaraia's partner was an alleged co-offender and was employed at the healthcare facility where the victim lived.
Advertisement
""She was employed as a caregiver at the healthcare facility. She dealt with the victim and had access to her personal affairs,"" the judge said.
""The victim had her eftpos card stolen from her handbag (which was) in her wardrobe in her room.""
On October 4, Hakaraia's partner failed to report to work and on October 18 she informed her manager that she would not be returning and resigned from her role.
""Over a period of time, this defendant and his co-offender used the victim's stolen eftpos card to complete numerous transactions over numerous locations,"" Judge Matheson said.
""As is often the way with matters such as this, he has nothing to show for the amount taken from the victim.""
The victim had $30,000 returned to her by her bank, but in a statement, her niece said that the process had been extremely stressful for both herself and her aunt.
It stated that the victimt was devastated when she learned what had happened and it took her some time to get over the impact of her trust being breached.
Judge Matheson said Hakaraia's life revolved around methamphetamine and gambling. During October he made transactions at local bars and TAB outlets throughout the Central Districts using the victim's eftpos card.
""Mr Hakaraia has appeared nearly every year since [his] first convictions in the district court back in 1998 and he has some 20 pages of adult convictions totalling in all 152,"" Judge Matheson said.
""He has been sadly imprisoned 82 times for separate offences. He is caught in a vicious cycle and he's currently receiving treatment for depression.""",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,17,81841
"An elderly woman with dementia has been the victim of a ""disgusting"" daylight mugging, having her handbag stolen while walking down a suburban street.
The daughter-in-law of the woman is urging people to be aware - this is the second handbag-snatching incident in three months.
Diane Van den Akker was ""disgusted"" to hear her mother-in-law, who suffers from dementia, was mugged last Friday while walking down Marguerita St.
Therese Shortall lives in the Glenbrae Arvida Retirement facility nearby and often walks to and from the bus stop on her own.
Advertisement
""She doesn't really remember it, which in a sense is a good thing, but she does have pretty bad bruising up her arm,"" Van den Akker said.
A neighbour reported the incident to Rotorua police, saying two young women pulled over their car before one got out and snatched the handbag off Shortall's arm.
""She's a tiny little thing, with a walking stick,"" Van den Akker said.
""I just couldn't believe they would do that to someone on purpose.""
Van den Akker said when she spoke to the rest home she discovered her mother wasn't the only one to have been approached or robbed.
As reported in the Rotorua Daily Post at the time, two young women stole a handbag from an elderly woman walking on Fenton St in April.
""To be preying on the older people is something else, especially to know this is women.
""I think they're just looking at opportune moments.""
She said Shortall couldn't remember the incident but she certainly hadn't mentioned catching the bus again.
""She's finding things really hard at the moment, it's been such a shock, I think her dementia is actually worse.""
Shortall told the Rotorua Daily Post it had been difficult having all her cards and her chequebook taken.
Glenbrae Arvida Retirement and Care manager Maria Jay said she had delivered a letter to the residents letting them know what happened.
""There are some sad people out there who do target our elderly and certainly when we delivered the letters, people were already aware and do take precautions.""
She said residents were careful not to wearing bags over their shoulders and were particular with the type of wallets they chose.
""It is really sad they have to be so vigilant.
""We are supporting them to live the life they want to live and people are taking advantage of that.
""Our residents will still be catching the bus and going out for walks.""
Rotorua police area prevention manager Inspector Brendon Keenan said there had been similar incidents before.
""Anyone that's vulnerable is open to this opportunist-type offending.
""It's not good at all, these are often the people in our community we want to protect the most.""
Keenan said it helped for people to travel together but he knew that wasn't always possible.
""It's also important to conceal items, don't make your bag too visible, use pockets or smaller bags.""",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,25,81248
"As a meeting last August in the Oval Office to discuss sanctions on Venezuela was concluding, President Donald Trump turned to his top aides and asked an unsettling question: With a fast unravelling Venezuela threatening regional security, why can't the U.S. just simply invade the troubled country?
The suggestion stunned those present at the meeting, including U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, both of whom have since left the administration.
This account of the previously undisclosed conversation comes from a senior administration official familiar with what was said.
In an exchange that lasted around five minutes, McMaster and others took turns explaining to Trump how military action could backfire and risk losing hard-won support among Latin American governments to punish President Nicolas Maduro for taking Venezuela down the path of dictatorship, according to the official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions.

But Trump pushed back. Although he gave no indication he was about to order up military plans, he pointed to what he considered past cases of successful gunboat diplomacy in the region, according to the official, like the invasions of Panama and Grenada in the 1980s.
The idea, despite his aides' best attempts to shoot it down, would nonetheless persist in the president's head.
The next day, August 11, Trump alarmed friends and foes alike with talk of a ""military option"" to remove Maduro from power. The public remarks were initially dismissed in U.S. policy circles as the sort of martial bluster people have come to expect from the reality TV star turned commander in chief.
But shortly afterward, he raised the issue with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, according to the U.S. official. Two high-ranking Colombian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid antagonising Trump confirmed the report.
Then in September, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, Trump discussed it again, this time at greater length, in a private dinner with leaders from four Latin American allies that included Santos, the same three people said and Politico reported in February.
The U.S. official said Trump was specifically briefed not to raise the issue and told it wouldn't play well, but the first thing the president said at the dinner was, ""My staff told me not to say this.""
Trump wanted to punish President Nicolas Maduro for taking Venezuela down the path of dictatorship.
Trump then went around asking each leader if they were sure they didn't want a military solution, according to the official, who added that each leader told Trump in clear terms they were sure.
Eventually, McMaster would pull aside the president and walk him through the dangers of an invasion, the official said.
Taken together, the behind-the-scenes talks, the extent and details of which have not been previously reported, highlight how Venezuela's political and economic crisis has received top attention under Trump in a way that was unimaginable in the Obama administration.
But critics say it also underscores how his ""America First"" foreign policy at times can seem outright reckless, providing ammunition to America's adversaries.
The White House declined to comment on the private conversations. But a National Security Council spokesman reiterated that the U.S. will consider all options at its disposal to help restore Venezuela's democracy and bring stability.
Under Trump's leadership, the U.S., Canada and European Union have levied sanctions on dozens of top Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, over allegations of corruption, drug trafficking and human rights abuses.
The U.S. has also distributed more than $30 million to help Venezuela's neighbours absorb an influx of more than 1 million migrants who have fled the country.For Maduro, who has long claimed that the U.S. has military designs on Venezuela and its vast oil reserves, Trump's bellicose talk provided the unpopular leader with an immediate if short-lived boost as he was trying to escape blame for widespread food shortages and hyperinflation.
Within days of the president's talk of a military option, Maduro filled the streets of Caracas with loyalists to condemn ""Emperor"" Trump's belligerence, ordered up nationwide military exercises and threatened with arrest opponents he said were plotting his overthrow with the U.S.
""Mind your own business and solve your own problems, Mr. Trump!"" thundered Nicolas Maduro, the president's son, at the government-stacked constituent assembly. ""If Venezuela were attacked, the rifles will arrive in New York, Mr. Trump,"" the younger Maduro said.
""We will take the White House.""
H.R. McMaster had to pull aside the president and walk him through the dangers of an invasion.
Even some of the staunchest U.S. allies were begrudgingly forced to side with Maduro in condemning Trump's sabre rattling. Santos, a big backer of U.S. attempts to isolate Maduro, said an invasion would have zero support in the region.
The Mercosur trade bloc, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying ""the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy"" and repudiating ""any option that implies the use of force.
""But among Venezuela's beleaguered opposition movement, hostility to the idea of a military intervention has slowly eased. A few weeks after Trump's public comments, Harvard economics professor Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister, wrote a syndicated column titled ""D Day Venezuela,"" in which he called for a ""coalition of the willing"" made up of regional powers and the U.S. to step in and support militarily a government appointed by the opposition-led national assembly.
Mark Feierstein, who oversaw Latin America on the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said that strident U.S. action on Venezuela, however commendable, won't loosen Maduro's grip on power if it's not accompanied by pressure from the streets.
However, he thinks Venezuelans have largely been demoralised after a crackdown on protests last year triggered dozens of deaths, and the threat of more repression has forced dozens of opposition leaders into exile.
""People inside and outside the administration know they can ignore plenty of what Trump says,"" Feierstein, who is now a senior adviser at the Albright Stonebridge Group, said of Trump's talk of military invasion of Venezuela.
""The concern is that it raised expectations among Venezuelans, many of whom are waiting for an external actor to save them.""",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,40,81740
"At the arrivals hall of Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, drivers bearing placards jostle with relatives to greet the 68 million passengers who pass through every year. For a select group of visitors, the Dutch government has lent a helping hand arranging the chauffeur service.
The visitors are senior managers at UK-based trading firms and venues, who need to decide whether the Dutch city will be their EU home when Britain leaves the bloc next March.
The drivers ferry visitors between meetings with everyone they need to know to set up in the city; property brokers, supervisors and executives at Amsterdam's cluster of big speed traders all feature on the agenda.
The meetings are paying off: Cboe Global Markets, the owner of the largest equity-trading venue in Europe, said Tuesday that it has chosen the Dutch city. Aquis Exchange, which also runs a stock-trading venue, will choose between Amsterdam and Paris in the coming weeks, a person with knowledge of the matter said.

TP ICAP, the world's largest interdealer broker, is weighing Amsterdam or Dublin, according to another person. Paris is also an option, a different person said.
Cboe's shortlist also comprised Amsterdam and the Irish capital, according to Mark Hemsley, president of the company's European business. ""We looked at proximity to customers such as brokers, market-makers and buyside. We also have a big derivatives franchise and the Dutch regulator has a history in those markets,"" he said in an interview.
A spokeswoman for Aquis declined to comment, as did a TP ICAP spokesman. In a memo to employees today, TP ICAP Group Strategy Director Mihiri Jayaweera said the company remains in talks with European regulators about the location of its hub.
For its part, London Stock Exchange Group has applied for additional licenses in Amsterdam to ensure its Turquoise stock-trading platform can continue servicing European customers after the UK quits the EU.
Companies such as Tradeweb, MarketAxess Holdings and NEX Group, which run trading venues known as multilateral trading facilities, have already chosen Amsterdam as their post-Brexit base. Bloomberg LP, the parent of this news organization, has also selected it as the EU base for its trading venues, a spokeswoman confirmed.
The competition between Amsterdam and rival financial centres has reached its end game. The Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets, which has a reputation as a market-friendly watchdog, set a deadline of July 1 for firms to seek approval if they want a guarantee of being regulated in time for Brexit.
The Dutch government is welcoming the arrival of new business in the Netherlands. Photo/123RF.
The Economic Affairs Ministry has led the effort to attract business to Amsterdam, approaching firms directly about using the city as a European hub, spokesman Michiel Bakhuizen said. When a company wants to visit, the central government and city authorities arrange a program of meetings.
The ministry also arranges meetings for visitors with Amsterdam's major trading firms. Dennis Dijkstra, the co-chief executive officer of Flow Traders NV, Europe's largest trader of exchange-traded funds, met with TP ICAP, Tradeweb and MarketAxess during their visits to the Netherlands.
""With the MTFs, we speak to all of them,"" Dijkstra said. ""It helps grow the industry. The closer they are the better.""
The Netherlands has already convinced the EU to move the European Medicines Agency, which employs 900 people in London, to Amsterdam from 2019. It also has extensive tax breaks for newly arrived expats, who pay no income tax on 30 per cent of their salary for eight years after their arrival.
While the incentives are strong, few of the companies involved have said how many people they will relocate. Firms would like to move as few people as possible and the minimum of resources to limit duplication. But the AFM will have the final say on what needs to move.
""One of our priorities is to maintain a level-playing field between the platforms,"" said Valérie Allard, who works on the AFM's Brexit team. ""We assess license applications by the institution. We look at their services among other things; how many services they will provide from here to Dutch or EU27 clients.""
One negative for the Netherlands is its bonus cap. The Dutch government capped bonuses at 20 per cent of salaries, far below the 200-per cent limit in the rest of the EU. MTFs have to impose the cap on their employees, but speed traders do not, at least not until 2020.

"COMMENT:
If you want to radically improve your sales and profits in any business, then you will need to change what you are currently doing and try something new or different.
As Tony Robbins said so well ""If you change nothing, nothing changes"".
One strategy that you might like to use is 'pull and stay' marketing rather than 'push and pray marketing'.
Advertisement
These are explained well in a delightful book I read called UnMarketing: Stop marketing. Start engaging.
UnMarketing is written by viral marketing and social media expert Scott Stratten.
In this book Scott talks about push and pray marketing. 'Push and Pray Marketing' is when you push something out there and pray that people will buy it.
Scott gave a great example of this approach in an event he attended called ""Art by the Lake"".
Here a number of artists would gather by the shoreline and set up in tents.
They would display their paintings, photographs, sculptures to large numbers of visitors.
The potential customers who came to ""Art by the Lake"" loved it.
They walked into each artist's tent, admired their work, made comments and often gave compliments.
Scott observed that the artists on the other hand were not nearly as engaging.
They were sitting in their lawn chairs, half-heartedly thanking people for their kind comments.
But you could tell they were secretly saying to themselves ""if you like it, why don't you buy it?""
The ratio of lookers to buyers was at least 100 to 1.
The most Scott saw any of the artists do with a person who didn't buy was to hand them a card and say 'let me know'.
And a crowd of potential customers would then move on to the next Artist's tent.
Scott noticed that crowds of people were raising their hand expressing interest in the artist's products and were simply being allowed to walk away.
And that brings us to 'Pull and Stay Marketing'.
With this approach you pull customer information and stay in front of them.
Let's imagine you are one of the artists at the ""Art by the Lake"" event.
Someone comes in and comments how wonderful your work is, especially your landscape photography.
Instead of just saying ""thanks"" you could say ""I appreciate it, I regularly take landscape photos and it's amazing how well they're received. I know it's tough to decide on art, especially when there are so many great artists here today. I have an 'exclusive preview' email I send out to people when I take new shots. I could also send you some shots of what is here today. Would you like to sign up? No charge.""
Now you can start to build a relationship with this person.
That night, after you take each visitor's email address, write a personal email to thank them for coming to your booth.
Send them a few shots and ask what they thought about the event.
You are now building a list of people who will get to like and trust you. Many of them will go on to become happy paying clients as you develop this relationship.
All from using the Pull and Stay Marketing approach.
There are dozens of proven marketing strategies that you can use right now to radically improve your sales and results.
The key is to change and try something new.
""Everyone has a 'risk muscle.' You keep it in shape by trying new things. If you don't, it atrophies. Make a point of using it at least once a day."" - Roger von Oech
Action Step:
What will you change with your marketing strategies in the next month?
What will you try that is new or different?

"COMMENT:
There are three poisoned chalices in government: health, housing and education - and two of them have just converged in a rather spectacular fashion.
Put health aside for the time being, Minister David Clark's got enough on his hands squabbling with the nurses over their pay and conditions.
There was certainly no raising of the chalices of the other two in celebration, more like drowning their sorrows.

Phil Twyford was, in his words, opening the door to affordable home ownership, which was little more than a public relations exercise. He invited aspiring home owners to register their interest in a ballot for a KiwiBuild home which was a bit like taking a stab in the dark.
Far from opening the door, there's still not a door to open - the first house has yet to make its appearance and over the next year just 1000 doors will beckon the ballots. And to qualify for a key to your phantom household you'll have to be earning less than $120,000 if you're a singleton and $180,000 if you have a partner.
Unfortunately it looks as though it's shaping up to be a middle class housing programme where you'd certainly need that level of income to cope with the mortgage, with the current average expected to be $650,000 and rising.
The idea of the half gallon, quarter acre, Pavlova Paradise that people of my generation expected as they scoffed and watched the kids on the trampoline in the backyard is long since gone. These days it's more like a stubby, 150 square metres and a meringue cupcake if you're lucky.
National's making hay while the building blocks are being put in place, but there's no reason for them to crow. They did little in terms of a house building programme until their final months in government but at the same time refused to acknowledge there was a housing crisis.
Still it seems they weren't averse to our country's biggest technology institute Unitec in Auckland's Mt Albert selling off 30ha of land to housing developers, until Labour got a whiff of it which is where the education chalice has been shattered.
Labour snaffled the land for its KiwiBuild programme, promising an elusive 3000-4000 apartments and Coronation Street terraced homes.
Unitec's now in dire financial straits, with the Minister Chris Hipkins likely to sack the institute's council and replace it with a commissioner. One of the main reasons cited for the polytechnic's black hole is a fall in student numbers.
It seems you can't even give away an education these days!",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,17,80678
"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A life-size bronze statue of a red-haired, freckled Archie will soon greet visitors at a New Hampshire town in honor of the local man who drew the comic book character and his group of wholesome teenage friends.
Bob Montana illustrated Archie, Betty, Veronica and Jughead from 1942 until his death in 1975 at age 54. He lived in Meredith, New Hampshire, for 35 years until he died from a heart attack while cross-country skiing.
""It is a privilege to be able to draw attention to one of our community members who did so much and did it so quietly and so well,"" said Monica Philbin, executive director of the Greater Meredith Program.
The Greater Meredith Program, a community development nonprofit, raised nearly $57,000 for the project in less than six months mostly from residents. Architect Chris Williams originally suggested the idea to honor the former Meredith resident with an Archie statue. Williams said no other sculpture of the character exists anywhere.
Advertisement
The one-of-a-kind statue will be commemorated Aug. 9 in Meredith's Community Park to coincide with the town's 250th anniversary.
Montana brought the Archie Andrews character to life when he drew the first ""Archie"" comic strip while renting a cottage on Lake Waukewan in 1942. He was joined by other illustrators over the years, including Tom Moore, who also chronicled Archie's escapades from 1953 until he retired in the 1980s.
The comic strip was distributed in newspapers nationwide a few years later. Its popularity led the company that originally published the comic books, MLJ Comics, to change their name to Archie Comic Publications in 1946. Over the years, the comic sold billions of copies worldwide and inspired several television shows including ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"" and ""Riverdale.""
In a book about Montana's life, author Carol Lee Anderson noted that he placed Archie at various New Hampshire landmarks, including Lake Winnipesaukee, and even modeled characters after people in the Lakes Region town. Archie's gang of friends were said to be inspired by the cartoonist's high school classmates in Haverhill, Massachusetts, and Montana used drawings of his characters for community fundraisers, including an effort to save a mill building in Laconia.
""My father was very proud to be able to earn his living by bringing a smile to people's faces,"" said his daughter Lynn Montana, who lives in Meredith. ""He wanted to empower Archie as a force of good that was bigger than the comic strip.""
Despite his fame, Lynn said her father was a humble and private man, partially why he raised his family in ""peaceful"" Meredith.
""In his eyes, Archie was famous, but he was not,"" Lynn said.
Montana's impact in Meredith went beyond the comic strip. He had a vision of turning Meredith into an art colony, his daughter said, at one point converting a gas station into an art studio and frame shop. He introduced several artists to the small town and created a local theater group.
Montana once united the community to change zoning laws, which prevented commercial development from being built along the waterfront in Meredith. He also successfully fought to have the town's parking meters removed, according to his daughter.
""He was a lot more than just a cartoonist, he was a wonderful friend, neighbor and leader in our community,"" said the project's chairman, Jim McFarlin, adding that there are still people in Meredith who remember the days when Montana would take children out for rides in his 1923 Model T Ford, the same car Archie drove in early comics.
The beaming statue will sit on a bench and look toward his workshop, now vacant, where Montana spent his days quietly drawing cartoons. The Belarusian artist commissioned to do the sculpture, Valery Mahuchy, said he wants to bring people together and offer unity with the statue.
""It's like a dream come true to have my father permanently honored in the town and we're so grateful to the community for supporting it in the way they have,"" Lynn said. ""It's a testament to my dad's work that it's still alive and meaningful to people today.""",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,29,81411

"Comment:
Do your civic duty on Election Day and vote, go to church on Sundays, but always bring a cool unemotional detachment to investing on Mondays.
That is a favourite theme of mine. It is why it is so important to separate your emotions from your investment portfolio. That was the reasoning behind a column I wrote last year questioning whether people should buy an exchange-traded fund based on biblical values. I have no problem with people wanting to feel good about their investments, but I also want them to realize what their choices potentially do to their returns.
Today, I want to see how well the Inspire Global Hope Large Cap ETF, with the ticker symbol BLES, has done in terms of returns and otherwise.
Advertisement
First, the benchmark: Finding a suitable one isn't easy, as the fund's holding are made up of 50 per cent US-based securities, 40 percent in developed-nation foreign securities and 10 percent in emerging markets. It invests in companies with market capitalisations of US$5 billion (NZ$7.4 billion) or more. The closest comparable indexes are either the BlackRock Inc.'s iShares MSCI World ETF or perhaps State Street Corp.'s SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust.
The fund lags both indexes in terms of returns at three months, six months, one year and since inception on February 28, 2017.
The cost of the Inspire fund is another factor, at 0.61 percent, which is more than twice as much as the BlackRock product, which is 0.24 percent, and it is more than half a percentage point higher than the State Street product, at 9.5 basis points. That's a pretty substantial drag on returns over a longer period of time.
My investment philosophy is that most of your portfolio should be in low-cost indexes. You should feel free to have some of your portfolio in non-indexes, but only if you can come up with a sound reason why you are moving a few per cent away from what looks like a sure thing into something that might or might not be a better substitute. My preferences have been toward the Fama-French factor model focused on value, size and quality. If you want to deviate from that, well you should have a defendable reason.
Feel free to use 5 per cent of your portfolio for your mad money, i.e., speculative or themed investments. But the bar for moving away from beta, or market-matching returns, in your pursuit of either above-market alpha or other factors is very high. Things get complicated when the portfolio shift is based on issues other than performance - ethics, politics, sustainable investing, corporate governance and social motivations. These all come with compromises.
One such non-financially motivated portfolio I noticed recently is named the Point Bridge GOP Stock Tracker ETF. Its clever stock symbol is what caught my eye: MAGA. GOP Stock Tracker's slogan is ""invest politically,"" a strategy many will tell you is counterproductive. As Bloomberg News reported, this ETF invests only in companies that are loyal to President Donald Trump and the Republican Party:
""Not necessarily the most profitable companies, or the fastest-growing, or the ones with the most attractive price-earnings ratios-or any of a number of metrics a typical investor would use. Instead, it selects companies based on public information about donations to Republican candidates by their employees and political action committees.""
This is a very strange basis for making an investment - it might satisfy an emotional need, but not a financial one. In fact, I showed earlier this year that the companies that Trump trashed did much better than the ones he liked.
The knee-jerk response will be, what about environmental, social and governance investment products? The short answer is that the first and third parts of ESG, environmental and governance, have a correlation with better performance. The underlying basis of environmental investing is that companies with less exposure to environmental volatility and associated costs tend to do better; on governance, diverse leadership is associated with less groupthink and better decision-making. No such correlation has been shown for social investing; similarly, an inverse correlation seems to exist for political investing.
If you want to invest from a political angle, the closest thing I have found to a rational basis is the Life + Liberty Emerging Markets Index, which says it incorporates ""human and economic freedom metrics as primary factors in our investment selection process."" The idea behind the Life + Liberty index, which will introduce an ETF in 2019, is that ""freer"" markets experience more sustainable growth, and attract, retain and allocate capital more efficiently than countries with unfree.
Politics and religion are both unavoidably emotional. That is why they tend to be bad for your investment returns. If you are worried about your mortal soul, try to be a nicer person, and pick up karma points where ever you can - preferably not when making investment decisions.

"Couples earning up to $180,000 will qualify for the Government's new KiwiBuild affordable homes, it was announced yesterday.
The price cap for any of those houses built in Tauranga will be $500,000 (including GST).
Housing and Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford said eligible buyers would have an equal chance to own a KiwiBuild home at cost price through a ballot system.
Those people would have to be first-home buyers or ""second chancers"", New Zealand citizens, permanent residents or those who ordinarily reside in New Zealand, and they would need to intend to own and live in the new home for at least three years (with some exemptions).

Tauranga mayor Greg Brownless said the income limits seemed too high and were way above an average wage.
""If we're looking to help people into houses that really need it, I would have thought the income limit would have been lower.""
He said the purpose of KiwiBuild should be to help people with combined incomes of ""way less than $100,000"" and with single incomes of around $50,000 to $60,000 or less.
Brownless also questioned the ownership minimum of three years and suggested it should be 10, because that would get rid of ""any chance of people doing it just to profit"".
However, he said it would still be good to see ""several hundred"" KiwiBuild homes built in Tauranga to deal with the ""ever-escalating price of houses"".
Tauranga mayor Greg Brownless. Photo / File
During a visit to Tauranga in April, Twyford did not say how many KiwiBuild houses would be built in Tauranga or when that could start, but referred to ""a significant number"".
Classic Builders director Peter Cooney, one of the largest builders in Tauranga, also felt the KiwiBuild income thresholds sounded high.
He was sceptical about KiwiBuild being able to increase the supply of affordable houses.
Developers did not need the Government to underwrite them when the price range KiwiBuild was targeting was already seeing huge demand, Cooney said.
""If I build houses for $500,000 in Tauranga, I'd have a list of people as long as my arm wanting to buy them.""
Cooney said ideally KiwiBuild would target lower price brackets, ""but the problem is you can't buy the land and build houses for that price"".
He said the only way to achieve that was to free up more land at a quicker pace. There was also the issue of access to labour.

Yesterday Twyford said KiwiBuild faced five major challenges – land availability, workforce constraints, consenting time frames, development and build times, and growth capacity constraints.
He said the household income threshold had been set that high because the programme was ""not welfare, but an aspirational middle-class policy"".
""We want to make it available to as broad a range as possible of young Kiwi families.""

"Developers of the $1 billion-plus Britomart precinct in downtown Auckland have announced a new 104-room, 10-level hotel on the site of Better Burger and The Britomart Country Club.
Cooper and Company said Bracewell Construction would begin building The Hotel Britomart on the corner of Gore St and Galway St in the area where the hospitality businesses traded but had now shut.
Plans for the new Britomart hotel.
Matthew Cockram, Cooper and Company chief executive, said international chain TFE Hotels had been appointed the operator and manager.
""Cooper and Company is commencing construction of The Hotel Britomart, a new 10-level development designed by Cheshire Architects in the Britomart precinct,"" a company statement said.

""The hotel will be built at the corner of Gore and Galway Streets, with the development extending to include the refurbishment and restoration of the adjoining Masonic and Buckland heritage buildings.
""International hoteliers TFE Hotels have been appointed as operator and manager of the hotel under the TFE Collections brand.""
Colliers International said this week New Zealand was suffering from a critical hotel room shortage. Only 526 rooms had been added to Auckland's hotel stock since 2013 and only 158 to Queenstown. Yet both were gateway areas for New Zealand tourism.
Dean Humphries, Colliers' national director of hotels and tourism, said the NZ International Convention Centre was expected to attract about 33,000 delegates a year; the America's Cup could attract 150,000 to 175,000 international visitors and Apec could attract 22,000 attendees, including 10,000 for the summit week alone.
The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has estimated New Zealand will have 5 million international visitors by 2024.
A new hotel is being built at the NZICC between Hobson St and Nelson St and a new Karaka hotel was announced last month under the Doubletree by Hilton brand.
Plans for the new DoubleTree by Hilton to be built at Karaka, a deal announced last month.
Cockram said his company's new hotel was the start of a new phase of Britomart's evolution. Nat Cheshire designed the building with Dajiang Tai, also of Cheshire Architects and it also designed the interiors.
""The project allows us to reach into the heart of the city block and open up intimate new laneways and a tiny cobbled square, which will enrich the streetscape and the future of Britomart. For us, this is as exciting as the hotel itself,"" Cheshire said.
Five suites will be developed and three of those will have outdoor areas, designed by Cheshire Architects and Seattle's Lucas Design Associates.
""The suites reference The Landing, the vineyard with luxury residences in the Bay of Islands also managed by Cooper and Company,"" the statement said, referring to Peter Cooper's rural waterfront Bay of Islands property, The Landing, where he is selling sites, many of them rural and waterfront.
The hotel's ground level will have shops and a lobby and the adjoining Masonic and Buckland heritage buildings will be restored as part of the project.
Matthew Cockram who announced the new hotel.
""The Hotel Britomart's ground floor will be occupied by retail outlets and food and beverage offerings. The new hotel will be connected to the adjacent heritage buildings by a laneway that will lead to the hotel's main entrance and also form a new connection with Customs Street through the Masonic Building. Cooper and Company is working with Auckland Council and Auckland Transport to transform Galway Street into a shared space during the hotel construction process, making the Britomart precinct an even more welcoming environment for pedestrians,"" the statement said.
The announcement follows the developer's ditched plans for a new Quay St hotel in controversial and much-criticised plans launched eight years ago when a panel of independent commissioners approved a towering hotel in the area which includes the Union Fish, Police Wharf and Northern Steamship buildings.
Concerns were raised at the time by the Auckland Council, Auckland Regional Council, Historic Places Trust and heritage campaigner Allan Matson to preserve the ""low-rise, heritage-based precinct"".
That was in 2010 and now a new site has been chosen for the development.
Cockram's statement said construction would take 20 months.",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,29,80772
"Diego Maradona has branded England's win over Colombia ""a monumental theft"", accusing them of diving and demanding an apology from Fifa for appointing Mark Geiger to referee the match.
In a scathing attack on Argentine television, Maradona claimed Harry Kane ""threw himself down"" for the penalty that gave England the lead, insisting the striker was not fouled.
He blamed Pierluigi Collina, the chairman of Fifa's referees committee, for Colombia's defeat following the decision to put Geiger in charge of Monday's game.
Maradona attended the match as a 'Fifa legend', with his role as an ambassador having already come under scrutiny over his antics during Argentina's games at the tournament.

The man whose Hand of God goal helped knock England out of the 1986 World Cup told TeleSUR: ""I saw a monumental theft. I apologise to all the Colombian people, but they must know the players are not to blame.
""It is the man who decides who the referee is who is to blame. A man like that [Geiger] should not be put in charge of a game of that magnitude.
""With all due respect, Pierluigi Collina, as the man who designates the referees, he is very bad. He must apologise to the Colombian people.
""I told [Fifa president] Gianni Infantino that, if I worked for Fifa, I would change everything. It has to be transparent. That's why I didn't go there.
""The referee will know a lot about baseball, but he has no idea about football. The Colombian players asked for VAR [Video Assistant Referee intervention] and he did not give it to them.
""Twice, the English threw themselves to the ground and he did not admonish them. This was theft.""
In an ill-tempered match Geiger struggled to control, England took the lead when Kane was bundled to the ground by Carlos Sanchez.
Maradona said: ""The penalty was not a foul. In fact, it was Kane's fault.
""The referee is looking somewhere else and when he turns his head, Kane is on the floor.
""Kane used his arm to hook Sanchez and then threw himself down.
""I repeat, why didn't the referee ask for the VAR? Colombia died standing. That's why I applaud them.""
The Telegraph approached Fifa for a response.
Immediately after Tuesday's game, Colombia captain Radamel Falcao accused Geiger of being biased in favour of England.
""I found it peculiar that they put an American referee in this instance,"" Falcao said.
""To tell you the truth, the process leaves a lot of doubts. He only spoke English. Some bias was certain.
""The referee disturbed us a lot. In the 50-50 plays, he always made the calls in favor of England. This situation was undermining us. He didn't act with the same criteria for both teams.
""When in doubt, he always went to the England side. It's shameful that this happens in the round of 16 of a World Cup.""
Geiger's tournament also began in controversial circumstances after he was accused of asking for a Portugal player's shirt during their 1-0 win over Morocco, an allegation Fifa condemned as false.",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,38,81729
"Donald Winnicott, one of the pre-eminent psychotherapists of the twentieth century - and in having a parenting programme on BBC radio was probably also the first ""media therapist"" - was famously quoted: ""There is no such thing as a baby, there is a baby and someone.""
Often misquoted as just the first half of that statement, it conveys the idea that psychologically babies don't exist without a caregiver, in those early days there is only the child-parent pairing, and that is how it should be.
It's also true to say there is no such thing as a ""naughty child."" There is a distressed child and a family.
Children act out their distress, and are, as Winnicott would undoubtedly agree, products of the environment they find themselves. They soak in the emotional environment of the family, and react to that in ways that sometimes can seem surprising.

Don't get me wrong, this is not some wrongheaded way of dismissing destructive, dangerous or hurtful behaviours, but we need to see that behaviour for what it is. Not a sign of an inherently ""naughty"" or BAD child, but expressions of distress that need to be understood, more often than not from a child that needs help.
This is also not an effort to blame parents. Life is distressing, death and loss, workplace stress, financial troubles, normal parental conflict, all these can impact children, and no one would say this is ""abuse"" or bad parenting.
It's just life, but adults have skills children don't possess when it comes to regulating these normal stresses. And it's our job as parents to see acting out - as it is called - for what it is: an expression of feelings that hasn't, or can't be, put into words.
Increasingly teachers get this, as do parents. Lots of positive messages around the harm of physical discipline, the need for parents to regulate their own emotions to calm their children, and the value of ""time in"" rather than ""time out"" sees this message increasingly getting through in ways that are really helpful.
But what I wonder is, why is it at some nominal point we stop seeing children as influenced, and even harmed by their environments, and decide that as an adult they just need to be responsible, or we'll lock them up, and in some cases throw away the key?
If we accept there is no such thing as a naughty child, why do we still cling to the idea of a bad adult?
Why is it not ""There is no such thing as a criminal? There is a distressed adult, and a society?""
As a society, we have a responsibility to all people, young or old to support them to find better ways to manage their distress. And as some have suggested, prison is like a time out for adults.
The thing about time out, for children or adults, is it deprives the person of the very thing they need to calm down, regulate themselves, or change their behaviour: meaningful connection.
Because there is also no such thing as an individual.",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,22,79840
"European businesses are unsettled as they watch the US and China collide over trade. And for good reason: the nascent global trade war could represent the biggest single threat to the economic upswing that has helped the region get past its financial crisis.
In theory, some European companies could benefit, jumping into market niches if Chinese businesses are kept out of the US market. But that would only be a few companies or sectors.
When your entire economy is heavily dependent on trade, an overall slowdown in global commerce caused by tit-for-tat import taxes provokes fear and undermines confidence.
And that's just what's happening in Europe. By one measure, business confidence has fallen in six of the past seven months in Germany, where exports are almost half of annual economic output.

""It's worth all our efforts to defuse this conflict, so it doesn't become a war,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday.
The US is due to put tariffs on US$34 billion (NZ$50 billion) worth of Chinese goods on Friday. The Chinese will respond with tariffs on an equivalent value of US products such as soybeans, seafood and crude oil.
Amid all this, Europe has its own trade dispute with the US. After the US put tariffs on steel and aluminium from many allies, including the European Union, the 28-country bloc responded with import taxes on some $3.25 billion of US goods. The Trump administration is also studying the option of putting tariffs on cars, which would significantly escalate the confrontation.
The head of the EU's executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, will head to Washington in late July to try to personally persuade Trump against further measures targeting Europe.
The disputes over trade threaten to spoil the good times for Europe's economy.
Growth last year was the strongest in a decade, since before the global financial crisis. While that has eased in recent quarters, the economy is still strong enough to create jobs. The number of unemployed fell by 125,000 in May, leaving unemployment in the 19 countries that use the euro at 8.4 per cent, the lowest since 2008 and down from a high of 12.1 per cent in 2013.
""Trade tensions stoked by US President Donald Trump are clouding the economic outlook in Europe,"" wrote analysts at Berenberg bank in London. They rated the trade risk ahead of troubles from Italy's heavy debt load or faster than expected interest rate increases from the US Federal Reserve.
Many European companies would suffer because they both produce and sell goods in the US and China, the world's biggest economies.
For example, tariffs that China is expected to impose Friday on US-made autos would hit German carmakers Daimler and BMW since they both make vehicles in the United States and export them to China.
Daimler has already lowered its outlook for profits, citing higher than expected costs from the new tariffs. BMW warned in a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Friday that tariffs would make it harder for it to sell in China the vehicles it builds at its factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina, ""potentially leading to strongly reduced export volumes and negative effects on investment and employment in the United States.""
Last year, BMW exported 272,000 vehicles from the Spartanburg plant, more than half its total production. Of those, 81,000 — worth US$2.37 billion — went to China. BMW says its exports reduced the US trade deficit by around US$1 billion.
By themselves, the tariffs that take effect Friday won't immediately have a dramatic impact on global trade. The fear is that retaliation will spiral, hitting the total amount of global commerce.
Even if the overall effect is to harm growth, there could be benefits for some European companies and sectors. Economists Alicia Garcia Herrero and Jianwei Xu at the French bank Natixis say that European makers of cars, aircraft, chemicals, computer chips and factory machinery could in theory snare market share by substituting for Chinese or American products in the two markets. But that's only if Europe's own trade dispute with the US does not escalate — a big if.
Europe is waiting to see whether the Trump administration will go ahead separately with tariffs on auto imports. European companies like BMW, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen's Porsche and Audi divisions, and Fiat Chrysler send $46.6 billion worth of vehicles every year to the US Some 13.3 million people, or 6.1 percent of the employed population of the EU, work in the automotive sector, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.
""Europe cannot win anything"" on an overall basis ""for one obvious reason: we are net exporters,"" said Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis and a senior fellow at European research institute Bruegel. ""But we should not understate the view that some sectors could get something out of a US-China trade war.""
Amid the brewing conflict, China has sought to get Europe on its side, putting on a diplomatic charm offensive during visits by Merkel and French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. The EU and China agreed last month to deepen commercial ties and support trade rules. But the EU remains a close, longtime ally of the US on a range of issues, despite the current tensions with the Trump administration.
One negative outcome for Europe, Herrero said, would be if Trump can push the Chinese into a trade agreement aimed at reducing the US trade deficit. The additional US goods to China could come at the expense of European competitors.
""If China concedes to the US proposed agreement, the whole situation faced by the EU would be much tougher,"" she and Xu wrote in a research note. ""For China to massively reduce its trade surplus with the US, it has to in some way substitute its imports away from the EU to the US, which would have a significant negative impact on the EU producers.""

"GENEVA (AP) — A group of U.N. human rights experts are expressing concerns about the health of the widow of late Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, saying the Chinese government should let her seek treatment wherever she wishes.
The independent experts commissioned by the U.N.'s Human Rights Council reiterated their call to Chinese authorities to indicate where Liu Xia is being held, and to release her.
The U.N. rights office says she has been under house arrest since 2010, when her husband won the Nobel prize. He died in custody last year.
The experts say Liu Xia reportedly suffers from ""severe psychological distress,"" pointing to audio recordings released in May in which she pleads for help.

Mire stood tall against Pakistan's full-strength attack as left-arm fast bowler Mohammad Amir (1-25) got his first game of the series and replaced Usman Khan.
Mire and Cephas Zhuwao (24) provided a solid opening partnership of 49 runs before Tarisai Musakanda (33) added 64 runs for the third wicket with Mire.
Mire, who hit six sixes and six fours, reached his half-century off 32 balls when he hoisted left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz for a six over long off in the 11th over.

"Hawke's Bay's expanding export industry has resulted in Napier Port's giant container-packing facility hitting an all-time yearly record - packing 50,000 shipping containers.
Port Pack, which has been operating at the port for about 25 years, handles about a third of the port's container volume and Napier Port general cargo manager Mark Babbington said for the 12 months to June the facility packed a record 50,000 TEU (20ft container equivalents).
That was a rise of 4000 on the same period last year.

""""It was just four years ago we were handling 10,000 TEU or thereabouts. So, we're pretty much at capacity now with our current resourcing and we are now really focusing on what we can do to improve our operations and processes.""
Mark Babbington, Napier Port general cargo manager with Dylan Turnbull, Port Pack manager. PHOTO / WARREN BUCKLAND
That had already involved changing the facility's layout and traffic flows to increase output and reducing handling outside the gates to reduce costs to customers.
About 98 per cent of the operation involved packing containers for export.
Port Pack operated rolling shifts between 6am and midnight, daily, with forklift drivers operating in teams of two, with pulp and timber collected by a 8-tonne forklift and then placed outside a container, before being pushed into place by a smaller forklift.
About 50 containers could be packed per shift, with about 120 packed every day, he said.
Babbington added that the Port Pack operation, along with the port's general cargo service dealings were major factors behind the Central North Island-based WPI pulp mill operation choosing to export its good from Napier rather than other North island ports.
Port pack manager Dylan Turnbull said the majority of the goods packed, mostly pulp and processed timber would be exported to China.
""I think our biggest challenges are working within our current footprint and keeping up with growth.
""We are an all seasonal operation, so we have consistent flow of goods, most from Hawke's Bay but also some from the Ruapehu district.
""Over the next month or two we will be reviewing our strategy going forward. As we grow we will be looking for more people, whether that's on port or off-port.""
Port Pack's success was indicative of the 30 highly-trained staff working at the facility.

Unicorn inflates ocean rescue statistics
Instagram is filled with thousands of #inflatableunicorn pictures from foreign climes, while the England football team were photographed racing them in the hotel pool ahead of their game against Panama.
But the giant inflatable unicorns are proving less popular with coastguards after a woman was blown out to sea and had to be rescued from one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
Some will have made their way over to France. Photo / Supplied
A helicopter was scrambled when the woman drifted into the Solent, a major shipping lane used by passenger, freight and military vessels. She was one of 15 people rescued along the south coast of England on Monday by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency after their inflatables, including a pink flamingo and a swan, veered off course.
The agency said rescue teams were also wasting time checking abandoned inflatables.
""Some of the inflatables were collected by our teams, some will have made their way over to France,"" it said.

"I've made some pretty bold claims in my time but I've never once claimed to know the future. Not until today, that is. Move over Herald horoscopes, I've got this one.
The future begins every day around a table at 10.30am in a small office not far from Christchurch's Hagley Park. A team of people are going through a list of crimes and figuring out what to do. The day I'm there, they have 24 family harm incidents before them, ranging from the minor (an argument between a couple), to the serious (a physical assault with visible injuries, including strangulation).
This team isn't fighting unsolved crime, but rather crime that might be committed in the future.
The idea came from police, who were regularly going to family violence calls and seeing the same offenders and the same victims. Arrest, lock 'em up, release, then repeat.
Advertisement
Crimes were being solved, but they weren't solving the crime problem. The causes of the offending, and therefore the problems, usually continued unaffected. Maybe the violence would occur in a different relationship, maybe in the same one, but it would invariably reoccur. Compounding the issue, the kids of those families often grow into the next generation of offenders.
Furthermore, some cases may not have led to arrests or charges, but showed signs of problems that were likely to escalate. Police could see crime coming in the future, but could do little other than offer a bit of doorstep advice.
In other words, crime is a complex phenomenon and yet we were tackling it in less than sophisticated ways. That high prison population we keep hearing about? In part that's because our thinking on crime has been woefully inadequate.
The police were using all the tools they had, but they needed more and that meant a multi-agency approach. Hence Integrated Safety Response (ISR) was formed, and is being piloted in Christchurch and Hamilton.
Around the table every morning in Christchurch are: an ISR co-ordinator, police, Oranga Tamariki, Corrections, two representatives from the CHB for general health and mental health, and a representative for all of the other relevant agencies and the non-governmental organisations, which are numerous.
In all there are about 48 agencies including the likes of ACC, the City Mission, Stopping Violence Services, He Waka Tapu and even, I kid you not, the SPCA (people cruel to animals will often be cruel to people or vice versa).
The ISR ensures work is done with the victim, the offender, and with peripheral issues, which are largely to do with the impacts of the environment on children.
For example, if there are drug or alcohol issues, Health will hook people up with addiction services or psychologists if there are mental health issues.
Many of the NGOs run stopping violence programmes and the Ministry of Education will follow up if a child is found not to be in school. The interventions are numerous and customised for individual circumstances.
One of the keys to this, as is probably evident, is information sharing. In part that means there is no wasteful duplication of services and that providers are complementing one another. The privacy issues at play have been well canvassed, and taken seriously. The higher the risk the more information that can be shared. Often it just means telling different agencies that there is an issue without giving any details. Schools, for example, might be notified so guidance counsellors can keep an eye out for behaviour that may indicate a resumption of problems at home.
A recent evaluation found that of all the incidents put before the ISR, 78 per cent receive some intervention (many multiple interventions) and 62 per cent have not returned to the ISR, meaning no further offending.
In the two years the pilot has been running in Christchurch, there has been one murder related to family violence and that was just as the ISR was beginning and neither the victim nor the offender had come to ISR attention. The usual number of domestic homicides is three to five per year.
Are these data encouraging? Yes they are. Definitive? Nope, not yet. More time is needed to really assess the impacts on offending and reoffending. There are likely some adjustments that need to be made, and a few incremental improvements, but overall, a multi-agency approach that addresses the drivers of crime is our best shot at making significant improvements. That conclusion is not just intuitive; it's supported by best practice research.
For years we have looked at crime as an issue for police and the justice system only. That thinking is now the past. A sophisticated approach that has an eye on prevention is the future of criminal justice.
And we didn't need a crystal ball to predict it; we just needed some rationality and reason. The same things, as it happens, that make for sound crime and justice policy.

"It's remarkable how we can all look and hear someone say or conduct themselves and come away with hugely varying understandings. Of course much of this comes down to socialised predetermination.
That is we have in our minds' eye quick value judgments by the way a person looks, their colour, their mannerisms, their religion and or any previous experience of that person. I guess that's why much has been made of Winston Peters ascending to the Acting Prime Minister's role.
Some commentators have determined that the sky will fall in, and that Peters is unstable, erratic and or a maverick. I have yet to see any evidence of that occurrence at all.
In fact, if you reflect upon the times in which Peters has been in Government — outside the Jenny Shipley (Prime Minister 1997-1999) coup of Jim Bolger (Prime Minister 1990-1997) and the disintegration of the New Zealand First-National coalition — you have to say that he's been a model minister in government.
Advertisement
More importantly, a number of commentators have attacked his litigation against senior bureaucrats and politicians.
Let's put the record straight.
Under our constitution, once the election writs have been signed off by the Governor-General, the Government is in all respects a tad off a caretaker government. Of course, this is a must, otherwise the party in government can use its control of the powerful organs of the state to pervert a fair election process.
So in effect, during this time period, ministers are acting at arm's length. There are protocols and ethics required of this period of government.
The Cabinet office releases directions over this period and affirms in paragraph 16 of Cabinet Office Memoranda (17) 1: ""That the neutrality of the Public Service and other agencies in the state service must be protected throughout the pre-election period.""
The State Services Commission further advises public servants that ""they're on heightened sensitivity over this period and should pay particular attention to maintaining neutrality, not applying personal beliefs and providing unbiased advice"".
Polling in the 2017 election clearly demonstrated three things of the National Party's support parties. The Maori Party were in ""grave"" difficulty, the ACT party were not registering and United Future was in Tombstone Territory.
National has always despised New Zealand First and Winston Peters. John Key campaigned to destroy them, and Bill English did the same in an attempt to take out the middle man.
National had a problem — they knew it and so did every bureaucrat.
It seems bizarre to me that personal and confidential information of an individual beneficiary was deemed by Brendan Boyle, chief executive of the Ministry of Social Development and Peter Hughes, head of the State Services Commission, who oversees the performance of these CEOs, important enough to disclose within this election period to ministers Anne Tolley and Paula Bennett.
That's why the court proceedings filed by Peters to get to the bottom of this leak is the absolutely correct response.
Notwithstanding this, I consider the leak itself is such a scurrilous dirty little act that it requires an independent retired judge or QC to investigate as well.
And if through litigation or via an independent review it is found that there was collusion between senior bureaucrats and Government Ministers, then they must pay the price as it would set a new low in New Zealand politics.
Surely those involved must have known that this information about Peters being circulated during this crucial election period would have a detrimental effect on Peters and New Zealand First?
Boyle and Hughes said they chose to disclose this information to the ministers under a policy of 'No Surprises'. There is no law or regulation defining exactly what the policy of No Surprises is.
That policy falls on the integrity, credibility and honesty of senior bureaucrats. There's no doubt, by their own admission, they passed this information on to Tolley and Bennett — absolutely no doubt.
Tolley and Bennett have both denied leaking Peters' private information to media. English, while Prime Minister, said it would have been better if the two ministers had not been told of the overpayments. But someone did leak, and you must question the motivation behind this mid-way through a hotly contested general election.
That's why, is it any wonder that Acting Prime Minister Peters is enraged? I am, because there has to be consequences.
This information about Peters was not about clever investigative journalism and would never have been obtained under the Official Information Act. The information was leaked to certain media outlets for what was to be an election sucker punch for New Zealand First and its charismatic leader.
All of a sudden Peters is attacked for initially seeking who passed on this information to that media outlet. Get it straight, who in their right mind would support a handpicked media outlet to drop this bomb on Peters? Why were they chosen and are they part of this sordid little saga?
For those that want to sweep this under the carpet by suggesting that Peters is somehow, somewhere out of order — really? What are their standards? What are there ethics? What are their values?

"It's still uncertain whether the Hastings and Napier Warehouses will be affected by job losses due to a major restructure.
A spokesperson from The Warehouse Group said they were unable to comment on the matter.
""We shared a proposal with our team last week which we developed with input from a working group of store managers. It's a proposal only and we are seeking feedback from team members in our 93 stores before deciding on next steps.""
First Union confirmed that 180 workers from 93 stores across the country would be losing their jobs.

First Union organiser Kate Davis said that after the restructure, new managers would be leaving customers with ""a Walmart, but without the yodelling boy"".
Speaking to Hawke's Bay Today from a Warehouse store in Westgate, she said a number of workers had serious concerns for their jobs.
""I think it's the more mature workers who have been in their roles for a long time who are the ones being affected.
""These workers have been at their jobs 20 years, we're talking about people who are stock supervisors. I've spoken to three stock worker supervisors and we now know that this particular job no longer exists.""
Davis said new management in The Warehouse Group had been bringing American corporate consultancies into their stores for recommendations for restructures as well as downsizing management teams.
""We just thought now that they're spending $6 million on management salaries that perhaps they could come up with something a little more original, which would show a little more initiative without making people redundant.
""The company has said that this is not a money making exercise. So if this isn't about cost-saving, then surely these people can keep their jobs and keep the same rate of pay.""
Davis said workers at stores in the cities were more likely to find jobs, but it would be more difficult in regional areas such as Hawke's Bay.
""There aren't as many alternatives as there are in the city, so I think it's going to be regional areas that will be hit the hardest.""
First Union said it was still uncertain which stores would be affected as The Warehouse Group wasn't releasing any information.
""I've heard nothing specific, we have put a request into the companies for a store by store breakdown. We know the information is available, we know the store managers have it, but for some reason the company are not prepared to give it to us.""
It's believed The Warehouse Group would be basing its restructure around lowering costs and increasing competitiveness.
But Davis failed to see how they could do that with fewer staff in the big red shed.
""They said they're going to focus on better customer service with fewer staff.
""They're focused on putting in self-serving checkouts throughout all the stores before the end of the year, so there's going to be less staff and they're going to lose that people factor.""",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,23,80846

"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — A Chinese company building a key rail link in Malaysia said Wednesday that it has been told to suspend work pending negotiations, and urged the new Malaysian government elected two months ago to honor the contract.
The suspension came just a day after Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng called for a sharp price reduction in the 688-kilometer (430-mile) East Coast Rail Link after discovering that the project's actual cost is 81 billion ringgit ($20 billion), nearly 50 percent higher than that estimated by the previous government.
The project is a key part of China's regional Belt and Road infrastructure initiative connecting Malaysia's west coast to rural eastern states. It is largely financed by China and the main contract was awarded in 2016 to China Communication by former Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was defeated in May 9 elections.
Lim has said the project's final cost included land acquisition, interest, fees and other operational costs. He said negotiations will be held as the project can only be financially and economically feasible with a ""drastic"" price cut by China Communication.

China Communication said it regrets the suspension and urged the new government to ""honor and respect"" the contract signed with Najib's administration. It said no duration was given for the suspension and that it could spark additional costs, losses and damages.
""We hope that both sides will be able to find a win-win solution through sincere negotiation with good will. We also hope that the suspension will be lifted as soon as possible,"" it said in a brief statement.
Lim has said the government has given China Communication 10 billion ringgit ($2.5 billion) in advance payment and 9.67 billion ringgit ($2.4 billion) as a progress payment. The advance payment can be recovered in a ""worst case scenario"" if the project is withdrawn, he added.
Malaysia's new government has axed a high-speed rail line to Singapore because it is too costly and is reviewing other large infrastructure projects financed by China. The cost-cutting came after officials revealed the national debt has surged sharply, partly due to corruption under Najib's rule.

"LOS FRESNOS, Texas (AP) — Gabriel Canas, a bus driver from El Salvador who fled his homeland after members of MS-13 stormed his bus, did an initial screening interview for asylum under the worst circumstances.
He hadn't spoken to his 9-year-old daughter since the Border Patrol separated them two weeks earlier. And in that time, he had been moved repeatedly from one detention facility to another.
""The day I had my interview, I wasn't well because they'd taken my daughter away. I was worried sick. I didn't know where she was. I hadn't spoken to her,"" Canas told a judge at the Port Isabel Detention Center in Texas, where parents of many of the more than 2,000 children who were separated under the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy await their fate.
His case illustrates an overlooked effect of the separations: Some immigrants complain that they stumbled through their first asylum interviews when they were deeply distraught over losing their children. The interviews can have life-changing consequences because they are critical to establishing why families cannot return home safely.
Advertisement
Not until a day after the interview did Canas learn through a lawyer what happened to his child. The asylum officer who conducted the interview issued a deportation order. On Monday, an immigration judge upheld it.
The judge cited new Justice Department guidelines that gang violence is not sufficient grounds for asylum. But Canas blames his poor interview and plans to seek another one.
Volunteer lawyers say parents are distressed about losing their children and having no firm date for when they will reunite, putting them at a big disadvantage when they meet with asylum officers from the Citizenship and Immigration Service.
The so-called credible-fear interviews at Port Isabel take place by phone within two to four weeks of a parent's arrest and last 45 to 90 minutes each, according to immigration attorney Jodi Goodwin. Getting an answer can take a week.
To clear the initial hurdle, asylum seekers must demonstrate a ""significant possibility"" that they can prove that they have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or political opinion if they are returned home.
They are judged partially on the consistency of their statements to border inspectors at the time of arrest. Attorneys say many asylum seekers, usually speaking through translators, fumble their interviews by holding back on details that may help their cases.
The risks of the interviews don't trouble immigration hard-liners. Many of them see the asylum process as a joke, saying it invites fraud by migrants who exaggerate claims and exploit loopholes to get into the U.S. When legal groups talk about flubbed interviews or asylum seekers who need to be coached through the process, hard-liners see evidence that migrants are rehearsing from a script.
Harlingen immigration attorney Norma Sepulveda is representing a dozen parents detained at Port Isabel, including Canas.
""The first thing he said to the asylum officer was: Do you know where my daughter is?"" said Sepulveda, who found the girl in Arizona after she was transferred there from Chicago.
After President Donald Trump ordered an end to the separations on June 20, border authorities generally stopped splitting up families for prosecution. But many at Port Isabel were arrested before Trump reversed course and are still separated. A federal judge in San Diego ruled last week that families must be reunited in 30 days, or 14 days if the children are younger than 5 years old.
Many of the parents have already been interviewed. Goodwin, who spearheads a network of volunteer lawyers, estimates that her attorneys had counseled about 210 separated parents at Port Isabel by the end of June. Most of them — about 150 — had already been through initial interviews.
Among those parents, more than half had talked to their children by phone. But they typically knew only that the children were in a government shelter and maybe the state or city where it was.
More than 3 out of 4 asylum seekers passed the screening from October to January, according to the latest published statistics. That approval rate may fall after Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to declare that domestic and gang violence are generally not sufficient grounds for asylum.
In Canas' case, the immigration judge cited the June 11 order from Sessions.
""It's not that I think that your fear is illegitimate,"" Judge Morris Onyewuchi said. ""But the cops I must follow have ruled that gang extortion, gang recruitment are not grounds for asylum.""
Citizenship and Immigration Services said it asks every asylum seeker if they feel comfortable proceeding and, if not, the interview is rescheduled.
""All applicants are asked about their health, to include their mental health and have the opportunity to discuss that issue as well as any issue that might impact their case with the interviewing officer. Our supervisors are directed to reschedule cases pending concerns that the applicant might have,"" the agency said in a statement.
The advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense sent volunteer attorneys to Port Isabel this week with the goal of counseling parents before their initial screening.
""We are talking to people who are distraught because they don't know where their children are and they're facing a complex, potentially life-or-death interview,"" said Wendy Young, president of the group. ""To have to face a complicated legal proceeding when you're so focused on the safety of your child, I can't imagine what that feels like.""
Canas, who was separated from his daughter at the Texas border, hopes to be reunited with her and to join his legal-resident parents and U.S. citizen sister in the U.S. His chances are poor, Sepulveda said, but he will seek a fresh asylum review.
""The purpose of coming here was to save my life and my daughter's life,"" he said. ""That's all.""

"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine government forces have foiled an attempt by a few dozen Muslim militants aligned with the Islamic State group to attack a small southern town in fighting that left four gunmen dead, an army official said Wednesday.
Army Lt. Col. Harold Cabunoc said troops clashed with 30-40 militants Tuesday and drove them away from the small farming community of Mopac where they planned to launch an attack on the town center of Datu Paglas about a half kilometer (quarter mile) away.
The militants from the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters led by Solaiman Tudon occupied several abandoned houses in Mopac, where he used to live, over the weekend but his family and other villagers asked the gunmen to leave.
""They took sniper positions and placed some bombs in the community and that alarmed the villagers,"" Cabunoc said.

Tudon's group is one of several small armed militant factions that have expressed support to the Islamic State group.
Clashes have erupted this week in a number of rural villages in Maguindanao province, where Datu Paglas is located, as troops pressed sporadic offensives to prevent a repeat of last year's siege of southern Marawi city by hundreds of Islamic State group-aligned militants.

"MASHPEE, Mass. (AP) — A modest courthouse and a fledgling police force, a housing development for American Indian families and a school where students are taught exclusively in the tribe's ancestral language. These are the visible signs of an independent tribal nation that has grown on the famous vacation getaway of Cape Cod in recent years.
But the future of those and other developments is uncertain as the Mashpee Wampanoag — the tribe whose ancestors broke bread with the Pilgrims nearly four centuries ago — awaits a decision from the Interior Department on whether it can continue to govern a slice of its historic lands.
The U.S. Department of Interior is reconsidering its 2015 decision to place some 300 acres into trust for the tribe. A federal judge who sided with local residents challenging the declaration sent it back to the agency for reconsideration in the final months of President Barack Obama's administration in 2016.
Land in trust is a special status in which the federal government holds the title to the property and allows the tribe to make its own decisions on how to develop the tax-exempt land and its natural resources.

""It's incredibly frustrating,"" says Jessie ""Little Doe"" Baird, the tribe's vice chairwoman. ""We've been struggling to keep land under our feet since the 1600s.""

Apart from instances in which tribes request it, the federal government hasn't removed a tribe's land trust status since the notorious Termination Era of the 1940s through the 1960s. Back then, Congress sought to end tribal independence by removing federal protections and pushing for the assimilation of American Indians, say Native American groups and federal Indian law experts.
""While it's not exactly the same, this brings back those same types of concerns, that those lands that have been seen as secure and protected are potentially not as secure as they were before,"" said Derrick Beetso, senior counsel for the National Congress of American Indians, the largest organization representing tribal communities.
Two dozen tribes, from the Apache in the Southwest to the Sioux in the Dakotas, have written letters in support of legislation in Congress proposed by Massachusetts lawmakers to enshrine the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe's land status.
The tribe's leaders have also been visiting other tribal territories in recent months to voice their concerns with the Trump administration's proposed changes to the land into trust process, which it sees as a direct response to its tortured legal case. The tribe's appeal of the 2016 court decision remains in federal court pending the Interior Department's action.
""This could be just the beginning,"" Baird said. ""If it can happen to us, it can happen to anyone.""
The proposed revisions weren't prompted by a specific tribe, said Nedra Darling, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, stressing that there's no timeframe for making regulatory changes. The agency's initial proposal was withdrawn after tribes objected.
Those draft regulations would have, among other things, given the public 30 days to appeal any land trust decision and stated explicitly that the Interior Department would comply with any court orders, rather than appeal them.
Tribes argue the Interior Department must commit to defending its land trust decisions — all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary — since opponents critical of the loss of taxable land frequently go to great lengths to keep lands out of tribal hands.
If the Mashpee Wampanoag loses trust status for its 321 acres, the tribe's four-judge court and two-member police department would likely have to be shut down, because they would no longer be operating on sovereign land, said Baird, the tribe's vice chairwoman.
The tribe would also probably have to halt work on a 143-bedroom housing development for tribal elders and families to seek local permits and approvals, she said. The tribe has already built roads, underground infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant for the project.
And it would almost certainly have to go back to the drawing board on its planned $1 billion casino and hotel complex on a 170-acre industrial park it owns in Taunton, a city some 50 miles away from its Cape Cod base. The tribe, backed by Malaysian gambling company the Genting Group, broke ground on the project in 2016 but halted work after residents, backed by a rival casino company, Chicago's Rush Street Gaming, successfully sued in federal court.
Paying back taxes is also a possibility, since the tribe and its members would again be subject to state and local taxes, said Robert Anderson, director of the Native American Law Center at the University of Washington in Seattle.
The closest comparisons to the Mashpee's situation, he said, are the experiences of Menominee Tribe in Wisconsin and the Klamath Tribes in Oregon during the Termination Era.
The Menominee lost a lumber mill and a hospital and had to sell some land to pay local taxes after they lost trust status. The Klamath took per-capital payments for its land and lost their reservation. Both have since regained federal recognition and some land, Anderson said.
The threat of losing sovereign territory is deeply personal for many in the 3,000-member Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, said Kevin ""Rising Eagle"" Frye, the tribe's police chief.
Elders like his 96-year-old father, Milton Frye, helped secure federal recognition, which finally came in 2007 and was a critical step in securing trust land, he said. Newer generations, like his 22-year-old son, Kevin Frye Jr., a newly minted Barnstable County deputy sheriff, hope to one day take their place in the tribe's growing government.
""There was so much pride when our tribe's flag was raised for the first time over sovereign land. So this is really tough. This is something our families have fought so hard for,"" Frye Sr. said. ""But at the same time, it doesn't change my job. I have to keep dealing with each day as it comes.""

The measure, which the lower parliament's information committee recommended on Tuesday, follows a law adopted last year under which Russia can designate media outlets receiving foreign government funding as foreign agents.
Naming an outlet as a foreign agent does not block its work but casts aspersions on its credibility. Demanding that individual journalists register as agents could produce a chilling effect.

"NEW DELHI (AP) — A media watch group on Wednesday expressed serious concern at ""an alarming deterioration in the working environment of journalists in India"" and demanded that the government ensure the safety of journalists who are feeling threatened.
Reporters Without Borders said in a report that at least three journalists were killed in India in 2017 and that a fourth case is still under investigation. In 2018, the situation appears to have worsened significantly, with four journalists killed in the first six months of the year.
""The hate speech directed toward journalists has increased massively, causing serious concern for their safety,"" the report said.
There was no immediate reaction from the Indian government.

The group demanded a swift and independent investigation of cases in which journalists have been targeted.
Neerja Choudhary, an Indian columnist, said the government was not acting as it should be given the rise in attacks on journalists. ""If the government was serious about the freedom of press, the media can't be treated like an upstart,"" she said. ""Those who want to stifle dissenting voices are getting emboldened as nobody is brought to book.""
On July 3, the general secretary of Reporters Without Borders, Christophe Deloire, wrote to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi telling him that an incident report had been issued in relation to press freedom in the country, and asking him to take urgent action. An incident report is issued when events are observed that could affect a country's ranking based on one or more of the indicators that are used in the evaluation for the World Press Freedom Index.
The group called on representatives of the government and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ""to condemn in the strongest terms online campaigns of hate and harassment aimed at journalists.""
The group listed the killings of four Indian journalists this year. Last month, the editor of the newspaper Rising Kashmir, Shujaat Bukhari, was shot dead along with two police guards as he left his office in Srinagar, the main city in the Indian portion of Kashmir.
In March, Sandeep Sharma, another journalist, was crushed to death by a garbage truck in Madhya Pradesh state in central India. Two other journalists, Navin Nischal and Vijay Singh, were run over and killed by a SUV in eastern Bihar state.
Seema Mustafa, director of New Delhi-based think-tank Center for Policy Analysis, said the attacks on journalists were intended to strike fear and further intimidate the media in India.

"NEW YORK (AP) — Whitney Houston's mother had no clue about allegations that her son and superstar daughter were molested as children until the making of the new documentary ""Whitney,"" says the film's executive producer.
Patricia Houston, the sister-in-law of Whitney, is responsible for getting the film, out Friday, to screen. Directed by Kevin Macdonald, ""Whitney"" paints an intimate portrait of the Grammy-winning pop queen and movie star through interviews with her brothers, her mother, friends, and behind-the-scenes footage. Houston's regal image over the decades was eroded by erratic behavior due to her drug use; she died in 2012, on the eve of the Grammys, after being discovered unresponsive in a hotel bathtub. She was 48.
It's the second documentary on Houston: ""Whitney: Can I Be Me"" was released earlier this year.
Patricia Houston, wife of Gary Garland-Houston, said it was difficult making ""Whitney"" because it hit so close to home — and because she was the one who had to tell Cissy Houston not only that there were abuse allegations, but they would be in the film.
Advertisement
""It was deeply a revelation for her. You think about her, and it being a bit overbearing for her to hear — and her kids not telling her. That's pretty tough to have to deal with,"" said Houston.
Dee Dee Warwick, the niece of Cissy Houston and sister to Dionne Warwick, was the alleged abuser. The alleged incidents took place when Gary and Whitney were between the ages of 7 and 9 and Cissy was touring. Warwick, who was 18 years older than Whitney Houston, died in 2008.
The documentary suggests that the sexual abuse endured by the children was a significant contributor to their struggles with drugs as adults.
""I don't think you can explain anyone's life from one particular event that's happened to them. But I think that it's certainly fair to say that it's maybe, in my opinion, the major contributor to Whitney's unhappiness,"" MacDonald said. ""That and the fact that she never talked about it, and that nobody in the family talked about this and clearly it happened as you'd learned in the film.""
MacDonald says the secrets in Houston's life took their toll on the Grammy-winning singer. He cites a clip in the film shot in the mid-2000s that shows her in conflict.
""I think there's an amazing piece of home movie footage in the film, which was from the early 2000s where Whitney is sort of really looking despairing. ... she's talking to herself, really going, 'Nippy calling Whitney. Whitney calling Nippy.' And Nippy was her sort of nickname that everybody close to her knew her as Nippy. And Nippy was the real her, as it were, the intimate her. Whitney was the persona,"" Macdonald said.
""I think what you see in that home movie clip is this confusion that she has. I think it got progressively worse as she got older. The confusion between what's the real me, and what's not the real me. And obviously, the drugs didn't help with that,"" Macdonald said.",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,29,79754

"Nurses at Middlemore Hospital's emergency department are being issued personal emergency alarms for their safety after a spike in violent assaults on staff.
Police are now also alerting Auckland EDs before they deliver anyone with suspected mental health issues who may be aggressive.
Hospitals are also training staff in de-escalation techniques and redesigning facilities to enable ""lockdown"" procedures so staff can escape violent situations.
At Middlemore, the number of violent incidents reported by staff shot up to 85 last year, from 30 in 2016.
Advertisement
The figures, revealed in a report on violence in the hospital's emergency department, also showed the number of calls to security had jumped from 31, in December 2016, to 65 at the same time last year. The jump reflected the increasing number of patients coming through the department, it said.
The report included a survey carried out over three weeks in April and May this year, which found the actual number of incidents was likely much higher than recorded.
During that time, 65 incidences of verbal abuse towards staff were observed - about three per day - meaning there could be more than 1100 incidents a year.
The most common incidents were insults, swearing and personal threats against female staff but the report found multiple accounts of physical aggression.
Middlemore put in place tools to help staff manage aggression following the survey, including issuing personal safety alarms to nurses. The alarms are on a key chain with a pin that can be pulled to activate a siren.
A Middlemore nurse, who'd been physically assaulted in the past, told the Herald she had already activated her alarm.
The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the alarm made her feel safer but training was needed on what to do when one sounded.
Aggression and violence went unreported almost daily, she said.
""There is so often a patient swearing at us. It can be a horrible environment. ""
New Zealand Resident Doctors' Association national secretary Deborah Powell said resident doctors reported more than 65 incidents during the survey period, but work pressures meant most doctors did not record them.
She said members questioned the value of some of the tools Middlemore had implemented.

""Having a personal warning alarm seems less than useful if it only summons the people who are already there but with their hands tied.""
Doctors were concerned they might end up sedating patients because it was the only way they could treat them and keep themselves safe.
New Zealand Nursing Organisation professional nursing adviser Suzanne Rolls last month told Newstalk ZB nurses had received head injuries, broken arms, bruises, been kicked, spat at and subject to sustained verbal intimidation.
A study in the New Zealand Medical Journal last month found violence and aggression in Christchurch Hospital's emergency department was also under-reported.
Nurse researcher and lead author of the study Sandra Richardson said workplace abuse was ""simply part of the job"" for many nurses.
Increasing aggression was a trend internationally and could reflect growing patient numbers, longer waiting times causing frustration and more people with mental health issues.
""It's been so easy for so long just to dismiss the verbal stuff but the culture it creates has a significant effect.
""Would we say it's okay to accept racial or sexual abuse? Why is it okay to just accept this constant barrage of verbal abuse? What Middlemore is experiencing is simply indicative of what's happening everywhere.""
Richardson backed Middlemore's initiatives, saying the alarms gave people a sense of empowerment.
Counties Manukau DHB declined to comment.
The Middlemore report also noted police had designed an app to allow officers to warn the department if they were bringing in patients with suspected mental health issues who may be aggressive.
Counties Manukau Senior Sergeant Laurie Culpan said the app was launched about a month ago and allowed police officers across Auckland to provide emergency departments and mental health teams with information about patients and their expected arrival time at hospital.
""It allows them to be prepared for that person when they get there.""
Powell said some resident doctors believed aggression had increased since police started taking people with suspected mental health issues to the emergency department instead of police stations for assessment.
""Whilst the ED doctors know these patients are coming in, there is little they can often do to prepare."" .
Other district health boards had also made changes to improve safety.
Canterbury had introduced a new electronic incident recording system and trained staff in de-escalation.
Auckland District Health Board had tried to give patients a better idea of treatment wait times, boosted security and redesigned the emergency department so areas could be locked down to allow staff to escape violent situations.

• Medication for dealing with ""behaviourally disturbed patients"" and guidelines showing what drugs and quantities should be used.
• A behaviour team to act as the first port of call after initial attempts to resolve situations.
• A redesigned assessment form to identify potential risks.
• New de-escalation training for staff.",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,44,79651
"PARIS (AP) — A tardy Naomi Campbell triggered a dangerous media scrum as she entered Jean-Paul Gaultier's couture ode to smoking in Paris Wednesday.
It raised the heat in the already scorching atmosphere on the final day of Paris fall-winter shows.
Temperatures reached heatwave levels and sweating fashionistas fanned themselves with Gaultier-branded fans.
Here are some highlights of the couture collections.

GAULTIER'S ODE TO SMOKING
It's been banned in public — but smoking evidently has not been outlawed as a source of fashion inspiration.
The unusual homage by Jean-Paul Gaultier to one of the world's dirtiest, and most glamorous, habits made for a typically tongue-in-cheek collection of 73 varied looks.
A black bison tuxedo jacket had the words ""Gaultier Smoking"" emblazoned on the front.
It was a play on words on the French translation on ""tuxedo,"" which is ""le smoking"" — and one that continued in myriad black and white deconstructions of tuxedo looks.
A surreal variation on the red Fez hat from Morocco — a country famed for its shisha pipes — also made an appearance. It covered the face, and from eye slits, the red tassels seemed to hang down like tears.
Tulle mouth masks followed white plume boas representing plumes of smoke.
But the final creation — a giant silver bridal veil — was the most creative look. Its shimmering, five-meter (16-foot) train was so diaphanous, it licked the air and evoked rising smoke.
Pedro Almodovar's muse, actress Rossy de Palma, applauded from the front row.

ELIE SAAB
Elie Saab took his itinerant couture inspiration to Barcelona this season.
The famed Modernist architecture of Antoni Gaudi — and its organic lines — were the focus of many of the Lebanese designer's gowns.
Oversize rounded shoulders, which were sometimes dramatically raised from the body, were a new silhouette variation on the house's bread-and-butter cinched waist looks.
The industrious Saab couture atelier had got to work to weave the signature crystals, sequins and pearls together to — as the program notes put it — depict ""the sinuosity of organic forms.""
The swirling stone reliefs of the Musee des Arts Decoratifs venue, inside the Louvre palace, accentuated the clothes' architectural lines.

PARIS FASHION GETS TOUGHER ON PRESS
Certain Paris Fashion Week houses pride themselves on careful image control and restrictive press access.
As privately held brands, this is their right — although it can sometimes be excessive and lead to accusations of elitism.
Invitations are sent to carefully selected journalists and buyers, and some houses prefer smaller venues. The system is thought to increase the mystery and cachet of the clothes.
Like Balenciaga, Maison Margiela under John Galliano is one of many with a highly strict policy.
For the second season Maison Margiela extended their media clampdown to all photographic agencies, bar two, sending out a note explaining they would be handling the photography mainly ""in-house"" for Wednesday's morning show.
The unusual move means that almost all images of the couture are now under the direct control of the Maison Margiela house.

"RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — A senior Palestinian official has lashed out at President Donald Trump, saying ""real estate men"" can't resolve the Middle East conflict.
Tuesday's remarks by Saeb Erekat, a veteran peace negotiator, came as the White House is expected to unveil a long-awaited peace plan.
Erekat says the White House ""should be run by great men, not real estate men,"" and that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ""won't be solved by the tools of real estate men.""
Erekat also said the Palestinian Authority will continue its payments to the families of jailed or slain Palestinian militants, after Israel passed a law this week withholding millions in taxes it collects for the Palestinians which are allocated for that purpose.

"RAYMONDVILLE, Texas (AP) — Officials in a remote South Texas county have approved a contract to open a privately run, 1,000-bed immigration lockup on the site of a tent city prison that was destroyed during a 2015 riot.
The Valley Morning Star of Harlingen reports that Willacy County commissioners on Monday agreed to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center outside Raymondville, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border city of Brownsville.
County Judge Aurelio Guerra says the new lockup will boost the local economy.
The prison that housed 3,000 inmates in tent-like domes closed after the 2015 uprising. A county lawsuit blamed the riot on ""abysmal mismanagement"" by Utah-based Management & Training Corp.

"SANAA, Yemen (AP) — The U.N. envoy to Yemen on Wednesday expressed optimism after meeting with the top leader of the Houthi rebels in a bid to end the country's devastating civil war.
In a statement issued before his departure from the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, Martin Griffiths said the rebels expressed a ""strong desire for peace"" and discussed ""concrete ideas for achieving peace,"" without elaborating.
He said he may meet with President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi in the southern city of Aden.
A Saudi-led coalition allied with Hadi's internationally recognized government has been at war with the Houthis since 2015, and previous peace efforts have failed.
Advertisement
The U.N. hopes to prevent a full-scale coalition assault on the port city of Hodeida, a vital lifeline for a country already teetering on the brink of famine.
The government has called on the Houthis to withdraw from all the areas they control, including a ""complete and unconditional"" pullout from Hodeida.
The Houthis have refused to withdraw from Hodeida, but they recently offered to let the U.N. manage the port as part of a cease-fire in the city. Griffiths said earlier that both sides have agreed to the deal in principle, and that the U.N. would take over administration of the port as soon as they finalize the agreement.
The United Arab Emirates, a leading member of the coalition, has said operations in Hodeida have been paused to give the envoy a chance to broker a peaceful resolution. The fighting has largely been confined to the city's outskirts.
The U.N. considers Yemen to be the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 22 million people in need of assistance.
Around 70 percent of Yemen's imported food and medicine arrives in Hodeida, and aid groups fear a protracted fight could shut down the port and potentially tip millions into starvation.
Houthis, accused by rivals of being an Iranian proxy, have arrested political opponents, including journalists.
The Yemeni Press Syndicate decried what it described as the abduction of Yemeni journalist Abdel-Salam al-Dais on Tuesday in Sanaa by an armed Houthi force. The syndicate held the group responsible and called for al-Dais' release.
In southern Yemen, where the UAE acts as de facto ruler through militias it has financed and armed, 29 detainees were released on Wednesday from Beir Ahmed prison in the southern city of Aden, according to two witnesses. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns.

Also on Wednesday, the mothers of detainees and men who have disappeared held a demonstration in front of Interior Minister Ahmed al-Maysari's house in Aden demanding the release of their sons, according to the relative of a detainee whose mother attended the meeting.

"SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Eight retired soldiers have been sentenced to 18 years in prison for one of the most emblematic murders of Chile's military dictatorship: the murder of folk singer Victor Jara and a government official.
The office of the court system announced the ruling on Tuesday, and it said a ninth veteran was sentenced to five years for cover-up.
Jara, a popular singer and university professor, was a fervent supporter of Marxist President Salvador Allende and he was seized only hours after Gen. Augusto Pinochet assaulted the presidential palace and overthrew Allende on Sept. 11, 1973.
Jara was taken to a stadium, where thousands of prisoners were being held. His hands and head were beaten and he was shot with at least 44 bullets as a warning to those who challenged Pinochet's authority.
Advertisement
Allende's prisons chief Littre Quiroga also was tortured and killed at the stadium, apparently because of alleged mistreatment of an officer who had earlier attempted a coup.
Jara and Quiroga were among the earliest of more than 3,000 suspected leftists slain during the 1973-90 dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
The bodies of the two men were dumped on a dusty street near the Metropolitan Cemetery and taken to the morgue, where someone recognized Jara and secretly informed his wife, the British dancer Joan Turner Jara.
The family managed to have his body exhumed for an autopsy in 2009.
Judge Miguel Vasquez imposed the sentences on Hugo Sanchez Marmonti, Raul Jofre Gonzalez, Edwin Dimter Bianchi, Nelson Haase Mazzei, Ernesto Bethke Wulf, Juan Jara Quintana, Hernan Chacon Soto and Patricio Vásquez Donoso to 15 years for the killings and three more for kidnapping them.
Rolando Melo Silva was sentenced to five years. The sentences can be appealed.
Chilean officials are seeking the extradition of a tenth former soldier, retired Lt. Pedro Barrientos, who emigrated to Florida and in 2016 lost a civil damages suit filed on behalf of Jara's family. He has denied any role in the deaths.

"Sometimes news unites the world. People everywhere have been anxiously following the fate of a dozen Thai boys and their football coach trapped in an underground cave.
Until last weekend the story looked like a tragedy. The young football team had ventured into the underground passageways the previous weekend, just before heavy rain flooded the area.
As the days passed and the rain continued, divers got as far as 3km into the system before being driven back by the rush of water through a narrow section of the passage. It hardly seemed possible that the boys could be alive.
Now that all 13 have been found on a high and dry ledge where they had taken refuge from the rising water, the world's attention is no less focused on their fate, possibly more so. For those lads, aged 11 to 16, and their coach, 25, face a challenge that would test people of any age. None are divers accustomed to breathing equipment, yet they will probably have to learn the techniques if the divers who have reached them can bring them out.

Other options are being explored. Pumps are still trying to lower the water level, a search continues for other cave entrances that might be connected to the chamber where the boys are huddled, perhaps it would be possible to drill a shaft to them, or perhaps they can be kept nourished where they are until the rainy season ends in October. None of those sound realistic.
The divers have rigged guide ropes through the passages of murky water and placed air tanks along the route. There is only one way out. And there is no hurry. The trapped can be supplied with all the food, medicine, lighting and communications they might need. Their only need that cannot be supplied from the world outside is mental fortitude.
The expert rescue divers now with them will be doing their utmost to make the boys relaxed at the idea of a long journey under water. If this is a typical bunch of early teens, some will be keen to have a go, others definitely not. Those not confident in water will be battling terror. The keen ones will probably be given plenty of practice, because they will need it and because watching them should lesson the fears of the rest.
They were a team when they went into the cave system and are probably a closer team now. For nearly 10 days they huddled together in darkness and silence deep underground. They would have lost track of time, sleeping fitfully, drinking water dripping from the roof of the cavern, growing more hungry and worrying they might not get out.
Compared to that worry, the ordeal they now face must seem manageable. For their families outside too, the relief that their sons have been found alive appears to eclipse any worry about how the boys will get out. Only the rescuers know how hard and risky it will be to see that the boys do not panic when they find themselves squeezing through narrow confines where the water flow is overwhelming.

"The Environmental Defence Society will pursue court action against the Hastings District Council and Craggy Range winery over the controversial Te Mata Peak track.
Society chief executive Gary Taylor said the paperwork would be sent to the High Court at Napier on Friday, challenging the decision-making process which led to Craggy Range building the track, which the society would argue was unlawful.
It would also be seeking an order for the track's removal.
""We are filing these proceedings because it has become clear that we can no longer rely on the earlier assurances of Craggy Range Vineyards that it would remove the track,"" Taylor said, in reference to statement made by the company in December.
Advertisement
""The assurances that were given late last year consisted of an unequivocal promise that we believe can no longer be relied on.
""The company now appears to be wriggling out of the public commitments it made and the track is still there.
""They had the resources to remove it, there's no practical impediment to do it - they are trying to fudge and use weasel words like remediation instead of the original promise.""
In May this year, Craggy Range chief executive Mike Wilding said the company's own landscape options and legal assessment showed removing the track would not be as simple as first thought, nor would it achieve an outcome to everyone's satisfaction.
""We are simply not prepared to take a direction that will leave the land in a worse condition and one that involves us in further contentious arguments about whether the track should be closed,"" he said.
Taylor said this was wrong. The society's experts had assessed the situation and found it would not be difficult to close the track and restore it to its original condition.
He said the company had not been replying to the society's requests for a clear explanation of its current intentions.
Those intentions changed somewhat last month, however, when the winery signed an agreement with Ngati Kahungunu iwi for the two parties to buy 28ha of land from the Drabble family, which would enable an alternative track to be built on the eastern face of the peak.
The current track would be closed and a cultural impact study would guide the new track.
A number of protests about the track have been held outside Craggy Range over recent weeks. Photo / File
This was met with resistance by Waimarama mana whenua, who Taylor said were supporting the society's case.
""Our two lawyers have been in touch.
""Te Mata is an outstanding natural landscape and feature and has profound cultural values that the council either undervalued or overlooked.
""We contend, with the support of the marae, that because of those values the resource consent application should have been publicly notified and that the decision to grant approval was wrong in law.""
He acknowledged the Hastings council had since set up a steering group to consider the future planning and use of Te Mata Peak.
""This is a good step forward which we support, but first the Craggy Range track must be removed and it is clear we need court action to ensure that happens.""
Waimarama kaumātua Robert MacDonald said mana whenua had taken the same stacne right from the start.
""We made it very clear we wanted the track removed - that has not changed.""
He said he had never been part of any discussions between Ngati Kahungunu and Craggy Range about the purchase of additional land with a view to building a new track.
""We have been consistent protesting the process whereby the new track was built - it was not a cultural issue, it was a legal issue - and we have had no part in any discussions about an alternative track.""
He said the uproar which followed the track being built proved it had been wrong to grant the non-notified consent.
Hastings mayor Sandra Hazlehurst said the council was focused on completing the project group work, including a thorough cultural impact assessment.
Despite the court action, she said the project team remained committed to a three-phase approach to the issue, with cultural and landscape values assessments due to be completed by the end of next month.
Aan assessment of the different track options, taking into account cultural, landscape and other technical information, would be undertaken in September.
In October, the council planned to seek public engagement and consultation on viable options.
Any final decisions regarding a new track were expected near the end of this year, then formal statutory processes involving resource consents could begin.

"The final stage of the Zespri headquarters in Mount Maunganui was part of nearly $60 million worth of building consents issued in Tauranga last month.
Priority One's latest building report showed Tauranga City Council issued $58.7m in building consents in June, which included $3.8m for the next stage of the Zespri head office development.
A total $1.5m was also issued for a new office building at 190 17th Ave, $2m for an office fit-out at 51 The Strand, $2m for alterations to 1 Devonport Rd and $5.2m for 25 new units at Metlifecare Pāpāmoa.
Zespri communications manager Oliver Broad said the $3.8m was for the final stage of the $40m-plus development, which was expected to be completed by March 2019.

Broad said the company had invested a substantial area of underground car parking to relieve the impact of parked cars on the surrounding residential streets.
""We are sympathetic to the fact that we have a residential area around us,"" he said.
The new office was designed for a modern way of working with both quiet zones and shared working spaces, Broad said.
""It will be much more flexible than the traditional way of working,"" he said. ""It is going to be a new feature for how we work together.""
Broad said the current location allowed the company to stay ""connected to the community"".
""It is close to the heartland of the growing kiwifruit industry. It will service a much better hub for the industry,"" he said.
Tauranga Chamber of Commerce chief Stan Gregec said the new Zespri headquarters would be a ""something of an icon"".
""Just like Trustpower set the standard a couple of years ago, Zespri will represent a new benchmark again,"" he said.
""Given its location in the centre of the Mount, I imagine it will become a real magnet for talent and be a fantastic modern working environment.""
Priority One communications and projects manager Annie Hill said the new building will have facilities to host growers and office space for other kiwifruit organisations.
Hill said the headquarters will also provide a fitting venue to host international trade, government and media delegations on behalf of the industry.
""It is great to see Zespri cement its place at the heart of the Bay of Plenty by making such a significant investment in their new head office,"" she said.
""Once complete, it will be an iconic building that will reflect Zespri's world class brand and future proof the kiwifruit industry's strong growth outlook.""
New Zealand Kiwifruit Growers Association's Mike Murphy said investment into Zespri's new head office had come while the industry was experiencing potential for rapid growth.
""With New Zealand kiwifruit production forecast to increase from 123 million trays in 2017 to 190 million trays in 2027, Zespri's head office investment is needed to help the business support the growth of the kiwifruit industry.""

"The owner of a New South Wales central coast holiday village has been ordered to pay nearly AU$19,000 (NZ$21,000) in compensation to an elderly handyman he sacked on the spot like ""some sort of Donald Trump"".
Anthony Morley filed an application for unfair dismissal with the Fair Work Commission in November last year after being summarily dismissed from the Two Shores Holiday Village at The Entrance by owner Raymond Smith, news.com.au reported.
The 62-year-old, a casual employee who had tended the gardens and performed general maintenance duties at the village since 2012, drew the ire from Smith for failing to fix a sprinkler system, allegedly resulting in a number of plants dying.
""As the conversation developed, the applicant rejected the suggestion that any loss of flora was caused by any inadequate watering on his part, and he reiterated that he needed parts in order to repair the irrigation/sprinkler system,"" Fair Work documents state.
Advertisement
""At this point in the conversation, Smith said, inter alia [among other things], that the applicant had had two years to fix the irrigation/sprinkler system and then he told the applicant that he was 'let go'.
""The applicant asked if he was being sacked, and Mr Smith confirmed the termination of the applicant's employment, and advised the applicant that he was given one week's notice of his dismissal from employment.""
Morley's lawyer told the Fair Work Commission that Smith, who visited the village several times a year with his wife and co-owner, had gone along with the sprinkler system being inoperable for years and had suddenly changed his mind.
He argued the sudden change of mind did not constitute a valid reason for Mr Morley's dismissal. He criticised Smith's decision to act alone without consulting the other directors of the company, including the couple's daughter, who lived at the site and was responsible for its day-to-day management.
""Mr Smith took this off his own bat and it appears to be some sort of Donald Trump, making all the decisions himself,"" he told the hearing.
The lawyer for Two Shores Holiday Village argued that there was a valid reason for Morley's dismissal because he fundamentally refused to follow instructions.
She said Morley made a conscious decision to refuse to repair the sprinkler system in direct defiance of the specific and repeated instructions, and fundamentally did what he thought was appropriate rather than what he was told.
Fair Work Commissioner Ian Cambridge found in favour of Mr Morley, arguing that he had ""no warning"" that failure to repair the sprinkler system ""was an issue that threatened his continued employment"".
""On the contrary, the applicant had an understandable belief that the employer tolerated the extensive delay with any repair to the irrigation/sprinkler system,"" he said. ""The decision to dismiss the applicant was made by Mr Smith in an outburst of frustration and for reasons that were not sound, well-founded or defensible.""
Cambridge said a ""conscious failure to comply with the reasonable direction"" would ""often provide for valid reason for dismissal"".
""However, in circumstances where the direction given by the employer is not of a nature where it would be reasonably apparent that failure to comply would jeopardise continued employment, it is necessary for the direction to be accompanied with a warning of the potential consequences of any failure to comply,"" he said.
Cambridge ordered Two Shores Holiday Village to pay Morley 20 weeks' wages of AU$19,096, minus a AU$500 loan which had not been repaid, for a total of AU$18,596.

"The same Families Package that delivered an extra $645 to the pockets of poor, cold, superannuitant Acting PM Winston Peters also delivered National leader Simon Bridges something of a problem.
It is true Peters probably does not need his Winter Warmer payment. But he has insisted he will take it as a matter of principle and to show his support for universality.
So Peters has become one of the poster boys for those benefiting from Labour's package – a combination of Working for Families entitlements, Accommodation Supplement increases, a baby bonus for newborns and cash to help superannuitants and beneficiaries pay their bills.
Because the July 1 start date for the various payments is about the 146th time they have been announced, Labour's sales job for it has been difficult.
Advertisement
It has consisted of Finance Minister Grant Robertson reading out lengthy and effusive epistles in Parliament until even Speaker Trevor Mallard gets bored and orders him to summarise to haiku length.
Nonetheless, Bridges has fallen into the trap that inevitably ensnares all leaders of the Opposition.
National leader Simon Bridges strong in his criticism of NZ First leader Winston Peters suing his own government officials. / Mark Mitchell
That is criticising what the Government has done without yet having anything to pit against it other than last year's dinner – National's more limited package for Working for Families, Accommodation Supplement and tax cuts for all.
So Bridges is bogged down in circuitous logic. He has argued simultaneously that Labour's package is too targeted but not targeted enough while National's would not have been targeted at all except when it was.
He has argued the main aspects of Labour's package provide no benefit to vast swathes of people because it is aimed at low and middle income families.
However, Labour's baby and winter payments are bad because they provide for all comers rather than only those on low incomes who need it.
In the next breath he claims National's tax cuts are good because they were universal rather than targeted at those on low incomes.
The bigger problem for Bridges comes in the next obvious question: will National repeal those two payments?
Thus far, Bridges has stopped short of saying that. This is not due to indecision. National has after all already said it will repeal things such as the regional fuel tax.
The difference is that repealing those payments would be taking money away from people who will by then be taking them for granted. The new treats will be perceived as entitlements.
It is the same dilemma National faced in 2008 over interest free student loans and Working for Families, a scheme it had initially opposed.
As Peters actions show, only a fool would turn down 'free' money.
A bigger fool would try to take it away from them.
So National caved on both interest-free student loans and Working for Families. Now Bridges must come up with a solution to the baby payments and winter payments.
All Bridges can do at this point is say what voters would have had if only Peters had gone with National instead of Labour after the last election.
In that regard, it is fair to point out in monetary terms Peters shortchanged himself in that decision he made.
The effect of National's proposed tax cuts would have seen him a grand total of $1700 better off a year, a combination of tax cuts on his salary and the flow on effect to his superannuation payments ($675 a year).
While all this was being digested, Peters' colleague NZ First MP Mark Patterson had uncovered the real threat to New Zealand's prosperity and set out to eliminate it.
He declared war on a vegetarian burger.
Patterson was first to cry foul upon discovering Air NZ was serving 'Impossible' burgers on international flights.
The burgers are made of plant-based meat substitutes.
Patterson declared this heme-enhanced meal an Enemy of the State, ruling the burgers ""pose an existential threat to New Zealand's second biggest export earner."" [meat]
He found an ally in National's carnivorous Nathan Guy.
Guy too said Air NZ should be rolling out the fatted lamb for its burgers, not fake meat.
Mike Moore, the champion of the Lamb Burger, will be proud although Patterson and Guy's solution probably would not quite meet the criteria for vegetarians.
Meat substitutes can also work elsewhere in life. Accusing politicians of leghemoglobin-barrel politics does have a condemnatory ring about it.
But Silence of the Textured Vegetable Protein does not sound quite as horrifying as Silence of the Lambs. Fava beans and chianti anyone?",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,40,81052
"The way we run our schools today was first proposed in 1988, by a supermarket director and business leader called Brian Picot. His views about schooling were a product of his times and reflected a wider nationwide deregulation of the economy.
The major idea was simple: competition is always a good thing because it drives up quality, encourages people to be responsive, and gets rid of slackers. Since this was deemed to be true in business, Picot postulated, it should also be true for the schooling system, which, at the time, was considered hide bound, lacking in innovative ideas, and non responsive.
Thanks to Mr Picot, and David Lange, the education minister at the time, New Zealand created what can only be described as a revolutionary schooling system which became known as Tomorrow's Schools.
It was, and remains the most devolved education system in the world, with every single school in the country being deemed an independent Crown entity with its own elected board.
Advertisement
In this new Tomorrow's Schools world, the Government was to set only the broad rules and schools were free to get on with competing and making decisions locally for the good of their communities.
Non-performing schools would be identified by an audit agency, and would gradually disappear as they closed down through lack of custom, just like any failing business.
Freed from Government control and bureaucracy, Picot believed, schools would flourish. He was only partially right.
Many schools have indeed flourished and enjoyed the freedom to the run their own affairs, and few would want to return to the mind numbing bureaucracies of the 80s.
However, pretty soon after the system was established it became clear that we cannot actually run a schooling system like a commercial business.
Some schools have large numbers of children who experience disadvantage whilst other schools have large numbers of children who are advantaged. While we know all students can make significant gains in learning and achievement, regardless of their circumstances, it is clear we are not starting on a level playing field by any means.
We cannot ignore disadvantage and hope that the market will sort it out. It can't, and it doesn't. What does happen however is that too many children emerge from the schooling system broken, and angry. If these significant numbers of children fail to contribute to the future of this country, and become alienated, we all lose.
By the early 90s the Ministry of Education understood that schools, particularly those in disadvantaged communities, and small, rural schools, needed support and could not simply be abandoned to market forces.
Since then we have seen decades of what can only be described as tinkering with the system, with numerous ad hoc changes and interventions from governments of various persuasions.
The purpose of this tinkering has been to try to plug gaps which the underlying competitive system, which still operates, has created.
We are left with a system so bedevilled by tensions and contradictions that it cannot work as effectively as we would like.
For example, school competition is encouraged but what happens to children in schools which are not ""winners""? And how can these schools be supported, perhaps by other schools, when the system is driving them to compete with each other?
Boards of trustees are given huge responsibilities and powers, but what happens when schools cannot find enough people to sit on a board, or when board members don't have any governance experience?
How it is possible for school principals to be leaders of learning, CEOs, property managers, and board members all at the same time?
Most of us would expect that our children should have access to quality schooling regardless of where we live, but how can this be achieved when the system is designed to create winner and loser schools?
Parents want choice about which school they send their children to. But what happens if this means some schools grow, gain additional resources, and are labelled as successful, whilst children left in schools with falling rolls, often the most disadvantaged, then have to cope with fewer resources and are labelled as attending ""failing schools"".
Government education agencies are expected to solve all these problems but they actually have quite limited powers in relation to boards of trustees.
None of these issues are simple. They cannot be solved by ad hoc tinkering and well meaning interventions. After almost 30 years, it is time to have a good re-think about what we want for our children's education, and design a system that delivers it.
For the good of all our children, and our nation as a whole.

"Three years ago and in a split second, life took a dramatic change for Rotorua's Alana Portsmouth.
On May 26, 2015, the then bubbly and extroverted nanny was on her way to see a mechanic about her car when she was rear-ended by a woman the family say was possibly suffering from ""baby brain"".
The pregnant woman gave false details to Alana and her dad Warren before leaving the scene.
Alana suffered a whiplash injury which, in the days following, resulted in dizziness, light-headedness and headaches at the back of the head.
Advertisement
As time went on, the symptoms worsened.
For two-and-a-half years, Alana visited specialists, including two neurologists and a neurosurgeon. She also saw physiotherapists, an osteopath, a chiropractor and had acupuncture – some things worked for a few days while others made her worse.
Late last year, a friend sent Alana a YouTube video about spinal fluid leaks and, according to Warren, the penny dropped instantly.
""We learned a Sydney neurosurgeon was our best way forward,"" he said. ""Alana and I spent a little over 10 weeks in Sydney earlier this year where she had several invasive tests which culminated in surgery to repair the leak.
""This was great but after three years of her body making excess spinal fluid to compensate for the leak, it continues to do so which is putting pressure on her brain.""
Alana returned to Sydney at the end of June for further tests and possibly a brain operation to fix the problem.
The family, including Alana, do have medical insurance that covers medical bills, but not flights or accommodation.
Alana said she was hoping and praying the Sydney neurosurgeon would be able to give her the life she had before May 2015.
""Work and Income have helped me start up a business, The Nanny Consultants, but even managing that is hard,"" she said.
""By 2pm, I'm pretty much done for the day. The injury impacts on absolutely everything I do.""
She said things were a little better since the spinal leak was repaired.
""Prior to that I would go to bed after lunch and wouldn't be able to get back up until the following day.
""I think, deep down, I know I'll never enjoy the life I lived before the accident but I remain hopeful.""

"Two Hollywood actors were kidnapped and held for ransom by a violent meth-fuelled gang for almost three days, it has been revealed.
Daisy McCrackin of 2002's Halloween: Resurrection fame and fellow performer Joseph Capone were lucky to have survived the ordeal, the details of which were made public for the first time.
Keith Andre Stewart, Johntae Jones and Amber Neal were arrested in Los Angeles this week in a series of dramatic operations by heavily armed police.

Neal's arrest on Monday by Los Angeles police was captured on bystander video and had been viewed more than 2.4 million times on Twitter.

They were collectively charged with 17 criminal charges including kidnapping, assault with a firearm, grand theft, mayhem, conspiracy and possession for sale of methamphetamine, according to a grand jury indictment that was unsealed earlier today in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
According to California's penal code, mayhem is when a person ""unlawfully and maliciously deprives a human being of a member of his body, or disables, disfigures, or renders it useless, or cuts or disables the tongue, or puts out an eye, or slits the nose, ear, or lip"".
Jones and Stewart face additional weapons-related charges while police allege that Stewart inflicted great bodily injury on the Mr Capone.
Court documents allege Stewart, Jones, and Neal gained entry into Ms McCrackin's South Los Angeles home on May 3.
Stewart allegedly pistol-whipped Mr Capone before his co-accused placed black hoods over the victims' heads and drove them to Jones' home in Compton.
Once there, the defendants allegedly stripped Mr Capone naked and held him without food in a bathtub for 30 hours, the indictment says.
Meanwhile, Jones and Neal are accused of taking Ms McCrackin's vehicle, a 2011 red Lexus, and driving her to multiple bank locations while demanding she provide at least US$10,000 ($14,785) to them for Capone's release.

McCrackin was allegedly forced to write a cheque to Neal, who deposited the money into her account, according to court documents.
Later on May 4, the defendants took the actress back to her home, where she was able to escape and alert police.
Stewart and Jones face a maximum possible sentence of life in state prison without the possibility of parole if convicted as charged. Neal faces up to life in prison.
Bail for Jones and Neal was set at $US1 million ($1.48 million), and Stewart's bail was US$2.08 million ($3.07 million).

"Two million New Zealanders will be obese in 20 years time, new research reveals.
An Otago University report published today in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health showed the average Body Mass Index (BMI) of Kiwis increased from 26.4 in 1997 to 28.3 in 2015.
If the trend continued, New Zealand's average BMI would exceed the obesity threshold of 30 by the early 2030s.
In 2015, 1.1 million New Zealanders were considered clinically obese but by 2038 that could be two million.

The prevalence of obesity in New Zealand had already trebled to 30 per cent between 1977 and 2013, making it the third most obese nation.
Researchers Dr Ross Wilson and Professor Haxby Abbott from the University of Otago's Centre for Musculoskeletal Outcomes Research at the Dunedin School of Medicine said the Government needed to take action to address the situation.
""High BMI has now overtaken tobacco as the greatest contributor to health loss in New Zealand, which emphasises the public health importance of these findings,"" Wilson said.

The study also showed the BMI of Māori and Pasifika and those living in socially deprived neighbourhoods was increasing at a faster rate. In 20 years the average BMI of the Pasifika population was expected to exceed the general population by 7.1-8.1 - up from a difference of 6.4 in 2015.
The research, which used data from more than 76,000 adults, found the increase in BMI was down to factors including greater availability and consumption of high-energy, low-nutrient foods and lower levels of physical activity.
""These findings emphasise the need for effective public health measures to address the causes of the obesity epidemic,"" the authors said.
""Altering or mitigating these environmental influences is therefore crucial to slow or reverse projected increases in population obesity.""
Obesity was a risk factor for many common health conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis and cancer which contributed the loss of quality of life, early death and higher healthcare expenditure, the report said.
""High BMI is the greatest contributing risk factor to health loss in NZ. Healthcare costs associated with treating overweight- and obesity-related conditions in NZ were estimated to be NZ$624 million in 2006, representing 4.4 per cent of all healthcare spending.""
The researchers suggested tobacco control could be a useful parallel for considering the importance of comprehensive reforms across a range of policy areas in halting the spread of a public health epidemic like obesity.
They suggested improving the relative affordability of healthy foods; restrictions on marketing of unhealthy foods; better nutritional labelling; more education; promotion of active modes of travel; and provision of facilities and space for physical recreation could all help stem the country's growing waistlines.",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,18,79727

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration's drive to wean poor people from government benefits by making them work has been slowed by a federal judge framing a fundamental question: Are poverty programs meant to show tough love or to help the needy?
U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington last week halted Kentucky's first-in-the-nation experiment with Medicaid work requirements, ruling that the Trump administration glossed over potential coverage losses. He sent the state's plan back to federal authorities for a harder look.
The debate goes well beyond Medicaid, the federal-state health program for low-income and disabled people.
This spring, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing cabinet agencies to add or strengthen work requirements for programs including subsidized housing, food stamps and cash welfare. The government's biggest assistance program for low-income people — the Earned Income Tax Credit — is already designed to supplement earnings from work.
Advertisement
Boasberg found that ""medical assistance"" is by law a ""central objective"" of Medicaid. While work requirements might be allowable if that's what a state wants, ""there may be limits to how much (coverage) loss is too much,"" he wrote.
Kentucky's Republican Gov. Matt Bevin wanted to impose work requirements on some 428,000 state residents who got Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act's expansion. Optional for states, the expansion passed under former President Barack Obama covers about 12 million people nationally, mainly adults.
Kentucky expanded Medicaid under a Democratic governor. Bevin argues that the cost is unsustainable for his state, even with Washington paying at least 90 percent of the bill, because many more people signed up than initially expected. The state estimated that work requirements would save money, reducing the Medicaid rolls by about 95,000 people over five years.
That number got the judge's attention.
Boasberg ruled that the federal Health and Human Services department didn't dig deeply enough into the potential coverage losses. The department ""paid no attention to that deprivation,"" he wrote, and ""this oversight is glaring,"" amounting to rubber-stamping the state's request.
Although state and federal officials contend that many people leaving Medicaid would find private coverage, Boasberg said there was no hard analysis, no ""bottom-line estimate.""
The ruling seemed to catch the Trump administration unprepared.
Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, called it ""disappointing."" The administration may appeal, or it may re-run its evaluation of the Kentucky plan to meet the judge's concerns. Medicaid work requirements in a few other states are unaffected.
However, the ruling may make it much harder to approve work requirements in states that have not expanded Medicaid. In such states, Medicaid recipients would face a high risk of losing health care because even paltry earnings could make them ineligible for continued coverage.
Verma said the administration won't be deterred from nudging the poor to go to work.
""We will continue to support innovative, state-driven policies that are designed to advance the objectives of the Medicaid program by improving health outcomes for thousands of low-income Americans,"" she said in a statement. Work improves health, the administration argues.
The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that about 60 percent of adults with Medicaid are already working, and among those not working, most either have health problems, are taking care of home or family or are students.
Advocates for low-income people say they feel like a corner has been turned, even if the issue is far from settled.
""What's particularly significant is that the judge basically said you have to look at the purpose of Medicaid, which is to provide coverage,"" said Judy Solomon of the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Work requirements ""were outside the core objectives of the Medicaid program, and he basically said you can't ignore the core objectives.""
Others point out that the judge stopped short of deciding the merits of the case, focusing instead on problems with the process that HHS followed in approving Kentucky's request.
Matt Salo, executive director of the nonpartisan National Association of Medicaid Directors, said work requirements may serve the purposes of Medicaid in some states, particularly if that helps convince conservative lawmakers to expand coverage to more uninsured people.
""There's a broader issue at play here about maintaining political support and the sustainability of the program,"" said Salo. ""Does the inability to do a work requirement lead to a scenario where Kentucky is going to get rid of the entire expansion?""
So far that hasn't happened, but Bevin did cut Medicaid dental and vision coverage in response to the judge's ruling.

"WEEHAWKEN, N.J. (AP) — With a lengthy highway construction project looming that could turn one of the Northeast's worst traffic bottlenecks into the stuff of post-apocalyptic fiction, local officials whose towns could be overrun by frustrated motorists say they're still in the dark on some aspects of the plan.
When lanes will be closed on the busy Route 495 viaduct connecting the New Jersey Turnpike to the Lincoln Tunnel is one unanswered question. In recent weeks the state Department of Transportation has said its $90 million project to rebuild the bridge and roadway will require closing a lane in each direction beginning in ""mid-summer.""
On Tuesday, a department of transportation spokesman said it would be ""later this summer."" Several local officials involved with discussions with the department said community outreach efforts are still underway and questions linger about handling traffic overflow, an indication the start could be some time away.
The pothole-ridden 80-year-old viaduct cuts through parts of Secaucus, North Bergen, Union City and Weehawken and accommodates more than 150,000 motorists daily. Local officials acknowledged the need to replace the bridge structure, which is considered structurally deficient and functionally obsolete. But some expressed concerns about logistics.

Weehawken Mayor Richard Turner, whose town squats over the entrance to the tunnel, said he hasn't been given a firm starting date for the lane closures, and has yet to meet with top state transportation officials about the project, though he expects that will happen soon.
""We're very concerned about the impact on traffic, and the resulting traffic jams on our local streets,"" Turner said. ""We are extremely concerned about emergency vehicles getting through.""
Turner noted that on a Saturday last month, a delay on Route 495 leaving New York left traffic at a standstill and forced many motorists onto the cramped streets of his town and others. That doesn't bode well for traffic during the bridge reconstruction, when the lanes will be closed 24/7, he said.
""I can't imagine what is going to happen on a weekday,"" Turner said.
According to the department's website, the work can't be performed solely during nighttime hours because the nature of the bridge work makes it impossible to replace portions each night and then allow traffic back on it during the daytime.
The department's plan includes detours for cars and trucks using Routes 1 and 9 northbound and southbound, where ramps from 495 will be closed off. That is likely to clog streets in Secaucus in a part of town that is home to outlets and big-box stores.
Turner and Secaucus Mayor Michael Gonnelli both said the state hasn't committed to reimbursing their towns for police overtime that likely will be required for traffic management.
Gonnelli said the traffic overload has the potential to be ""a nightmare either way.""
""We're downstream from where this is happening, but we are affected anytime something happens, and we're affected badly,"" he said. ""I try to take my wife out to eat on a Friday night, and you can't get out of town.""",www.nzherald.co.nz,2018-07-05 00:00:00,21,80555
"WINNIPEG (AP) — The Winnipeg Hawks appointed controversial Australian opening batsman David Warner as captain of their Global T20 Canada team on Wednesday.
The 31-year-old cricketer replaces the injured West Indian Dwayne Bravo as skipper.
Hawks coach Waqar Younis told the BBC: ""He's going to be a good leader. He's a team man. He's up front and he likes to give whatever his knowledge is.""
Earlier this year, Warner was banned from international and domestic state cricket for 12 months by Cricket Australia following the ball-tampering row that blew up during the national team's tour of South Africa.

"When stuck in a hole the best advice is to stop digging, but what if you can't spot the hole in the first place? The NCEA review's promotion of project-based learning is an example of the sort of frantic digging that occurs when profoundly and blindly stuck.
What's wrong with projects? As the Hobsonville School students argued so passionately in the Herald recently, learning by doing projects is motivating and encourages learning. This ""knowledge-how"" approach also fits nicely with New Zealand's skills-based national curriculum. But what does the approach actually mean and what is the source of this learning?
These are the questions the NCEA review needs to ask. We curriculum designers call the source of learning ""knowledge-that"". It's made up of propositions, concepts, and content, referred to broadly as academic subjects. Knowledge-that is very different from the knowledge-how we practise in activities and projects.
The difference between the two forms of knowledge matters because the problem for our education system is to do with their order. The fatal flaw in the national curriculum and NCEA is that the knowledge order is wrong.
Advertisement
At present we put the skills of knowledge-how first. But we need to start with academic knowledge (knowledge-that), then have the well-designed and exciting activities and projects which allow students to show their understanding.
Assessment comes in at the final stage. Crucially, it should measure the understanding of the knowledge as demonstrated in its skilful application. At present the assessment tends to measure the skills themselves. It's easier that way.
Let's look at some examples — the alphabet (for young children), trigonometry (for older students), electrical circuits (for university engineering students). The same design principles apply to all ages.
If we use a knowledge-how approach to start, we would ask students to sound out the letters of the alphabet, measure the viewshafts from Auckland's volcanoes, calculate the current in the resistor in the circuit. It certainly sounds a sensible approach. After all, we do want young people to use the knowledge they acquire at school.
What's missing from these examples is what we need to know first so that using the skills is actually showing what we understand as well as what we can do.
When children sound out alphabet letters how do we know they associate the squiggles on the page with alphabetical names or are they just parroting the adult?
What trigonometry do you need before you can measure the viewshafts from Auckland's volcanoes or do you simply follow a list of instructions?
We may be able to calculate the current in the resistor in the electrical circuit by following the rules. But if we want to be able to do this in other projects, to generalise in other words, we need to know that current is a response to the application of electric potential to a closed circuit.
Following instructions and applying skills won't tell us that. We have to be taught it.
This is the crucial difference between the two forms of knowledge. Academic knowledge (knowledge-that) enables us to understand the meaning of what we do. It is challenging but also deeply fulfilling when we finally ""get it"". Because it can't be picked up from experience, it needs to be taught by an expert; a teacher in other words.
It's the old saying, academic knowledge is ""taught not caught"". The problem is academic knowledge is not as visible as knowledge-how so we tend to think the skills we see in action are the same as understanding what is meant.
A serious limitation of knowledge-how is that it doesn't provide the knowledge needed to generalise. When we think of professionals such as engineers, medical professionals, and teachers whose knowledge has consequences for the lives of others, whether the skills we see on the surface are informed by deep knowledge really does matter.
Starting with knowledge-how, with the project hands-on approach, leads to the very rote learning its supporters are, rightly, so opposed to. But there are deeper problems caused by starting with knowledge-how.
Without being taught the academic ideas behind the ""doing"" we cannot generalise to other projects or other situations. We are stuck in the one instance, in the here and now. We can follow instructions. We can apply skills, often quite advanced skills, but we can't understand, let alone explain and justify, why we do what we do.
It should concern us all that while New Zealand students are stuck in the knowledge-how world of experience, the NCEA review is there too.

HARD MAN: Former Casino lock Damien Benn is at the top of the pile at the Cougars. Mike Donnelly
Andrew Battese, Ballina
As skilled and competitive as they come and looks to be getting better with age, having already scored 14 tries this season. Durable and has won four NRRRL premierships while front rower Dylan Montgomery has also been dominant since the 2013 season.
Simon Kelly, Byron Bay
The most consistent front-rower over the past decade and a stand-out in separate stints at the Red Devils. He won a grand final at Byron Bay in 2008 and has played in two since then with Cudgen before returning to the Red Devils this season.
Damien Benn, Casino
Not the most flashy player but there has been no one as determined and harder to contain than the rampaging lock. A back injury cut his career short but he was the backbone of the team and it was no coincidence the Cougars made a preliminary final in 2016 when he was at his best.
Jack Wythes, Evans Head
Went unnoticed for a few years out in the centres but quickly become one of the hardest-working players in the competition when he moved to lock.
Phenomenal work rate and picked up a well deserved NRRRL Player of the Year award in 2015.
Lachlan Crawter, Kyogle
Started as a teenage winger in 2014 and was already their best forward and captain last season. The fact that he has played centre and front-row in the same season shows how committed and versatile he is.
Jack Durheim, Marist
Brothers
Plenty of skill for a lock but also has the engine and determination to back it up with his efforts around the field. His best years so far have been 2016 and 2017 while injuries have limited him to one game this season with the Rams at seventh on the ladder.
Josh Castellano,
Mullumbimby
He was always big and looked to have plenty of potential but he has exceeded all expectations this season. Castellano has played through some lean years at the Giants but now finds himself with plenty of other talented players around him and it's seen him grow further in confidence.
Alwyn Roberts, Northern
United
There has been an abundance of naturally talented and entertaining players at United but no one has stood up more than Alwyn Roberts. He has had three separate stints at the club and has played everywhere from five-eighth to front row.
Caleb Ziebell, Cudgen
NSW Country front-rower and the obvious choice from a side that rejoined the NRRRL competition from the Gold Coast in 2015.
There has been no shortage of talent in the Cudgen side but Ziebell stands at the top of the pile with his size and freakish ability.
Grant Brown, Lower Clarence
Kicked the winning field goal when Lower Clarence won the grand final in 2009 and always puts in a whole-hearted effort.
an uncompromising player and the Magpies have benefited from his recent return as they battle their way out of several lean years.
Sam O'Dea, Murwillumbah
Stuck behind Andrew Battese at representative level but that didn't stop him from winning NRRRL Player of the Year and premierships at Murwillumbah.
He retired at the end of last season and was captain when they won the 2016 grand final just one week after the death of teammate Grant Cook.
Guy Lanston, Tweed Coast

"MORE than 30 eye witnesses could be called in the case against a Murwillumbah man accused of the stabbing murder of a father of four in broad daylight last year.
Charlie Larter tragically lost his life on his 46th birthday after intervening in a brawl in Knox Park, Murwillumbah, between noon and 2pm on June 6 last year.
James Paul Alderton, now 23, was subsequently charged with his murder.
Mr Alderton appeared in Lismore Local Court via video link on Tuesday, where he was represented by public defender Jason Watts.
The 23-year-old also stands accused of stabbing Mr Larter's son Zackary and another man, as well as the theft of a kitchen knife from a nearby Coles supermarket just prior to the alleged stabbings.
Mr Watts told the court he was seeking a further adjournment of the matter so the prosecution could consider some written submissions the defence provided late on Monday.
""I can indicate that Section 91 written submissions were given to the prosecution yesterday,” Mr Watts said.
""I understand my friend needs some time to consider those.”
Mr Watts said the submissions included some 16 witness statements to the alleged events of June 6.
He also said the number of witnesses included in the defence submissions was ""less than half” the total number of alleged eye witnesses to the events of the day.
Magistrate Annett Sinclair asked DPP prosecutor Alanna Coxon whether a two-week adjournment was sufficient for the prosecution to consider the submissions ahead of a possible committal hearing.

"Master furniture maker, Geoffrey Hannah, and stonemason, Keith Smith share their skills and experience at The Beckinsales Monumental Masons workshop in North Lismore.
Master furniture maker, Geoffrey Hannah, and stonemason, Keith Smith share their skills and experience at The Beckinsales Monumental Masons workshop in North Lismore. Sophie Moeller
GEOFF Hannah needed some advice about a piece of slate for his latest creation so he went to see Keith Smith at Beckinsales monumental masons.
It is fair to say a master tradesmans' bromance became set in stone.
Truth is, our local fine furniture maker - and the creator of the famous Hannah Cabinet that has pride of place in our new Regional Gallery - has been curious about the work done by Beckinsales in Lismore since he was a young boy.
Beckinsales came to Lismore from Bangalow where it began in 1933.
Geoff still remembers the masons cutting their monuments on the curbside next to Browns Creek on Keen Street.
Smith, who began his career as a plasterer and went on to work terrazzo tiling, has had a passion for cemeteries his whole life.
He bought Beckinsales, now on the corner of Ballina and Bridge streets in North Lismore, back in 89.
Apart from countless cemetery monuments, Keith takes credit for many of the altars and lecterns in the region's churches.
""I've always been on the arty side, even as a cement renderer, and never liked modern buildings. It has always been the Edwardian era that has appealed to me,” says Keith.
Tintenbar Cemetery is one of his favourites. The tombstones provide insight into the wealth and local history, of the region, in a way that the concrete headstones with bronze plates of today, just can't.
So when Geoff came in to the workshop to discuss the Georgian Doll's House he is currently working on, Keith ""took an instant shine to the job”.
""I went and saw what he was up to and he got me thinking about a few materials,” he says. ""I love what Geoff does.”
""I don't have the patience he does, to do that kind of work, but I was able to show him a few stones and we came up with something that could work.”
After countless hours of trial and error and the jettisoning of over 500 tiles that made the doll's house look a ""bit bushy”, the duo came up with a material that had ""hardly any faults in it”.
""It's not a profitable process in terms of time taken, but there is always a good lesson in your mistakes,” says Geoff, ""and it's never wasted.”
""Keith has a different way of cutting to me but his advice has been great. I say something and he knows what I am thinking. The knowledge that goes with that experience and working with certain materials for all those years, it is just priceless,” says Geoff.
The two are soon laughing and waxing lyrical about how the artistry - that once existed in classical art, tombstones and fine furniture - is now a fading discipline. They trade comments about each other with characteristic humility.
""If I can do it, anybody can,” says Geoff.
""No one can do what you do mate,” says Keith.
What they agree on is, that to succeed in your craft, you need to share your knowledge.
""You get people who are too proud to ask questions. The fact is, you can ask anybody anything and they will never know everything but together you will always know enough, "" says Keith.
""If you don't share your knowledge people miss out and that is a shame,”says Geoff. ""If you give away what you got, you will always get back double. And that is with everything in life.”
Geoff's Doll's House will be made of precious stones, metals and woods. He has a date he aims to have it finished by but says it ""will be ready when its done”.",www.northernstar.com.au,2018-07-05 00:00:00,31,150932

Richmond Valley Council is seeking input on the redevelopment of the Casino showground. Contributed
A MASTER plan for the $8 million redevelopment of the Casino showground and racecourse site has been revealed.
And now Richmond Valley Council is seeking community feedback on the plan.
The council has been working with regular users of the site for the past 12 months, and the draft master plan is based on information gathered in workshops and consultation with key stakeholders.
Consideration was given to what is currently happening on the site, the needs of the community, the wider surroundings, social, environmental and economic considerations and planning constraints and opportunities.
The council's general manager, Vaughan Macdonald, said there was the potential to ""greatly enhance the facilities for the future”.
The sporting and community-based facility would be turned into a modern precinct, attracting people from around the region and interstate.
Mr Macdonald said the associated infrastructure would allow for major regional events which would provide an economic boost to the Richmond Valley.
The master plan for the Casino showground and racecourse. Contributed
""Exciting additions proposed for the site include an indoor equestrian arena, redevelopment of the horse racing training stables, and renewal of the sand track and racecourse proper,” Mr Macdonald said.
""Council recognises the importance of the showgrounds area to the town and people of the Richmond Valley area, and would like to see the site upgraded for the enjoyment of a wide variety of people, of all ages and abilities.”
Richmond Valley Council Mayor Robert Mustow said he hoped Council's vision for the showgrounds would start to become a reality within the very near future.
Cr Mustow said the draft master plan would be used to support an $8 million Regional Sports Infrastructure Fund Grant application for the proposed works.
He said the time was right for this type of redevelopment to ensure not only current activities survived and flourished, but for new ones to start up.
""The showgrounds have an important historical and social significance and are home of the Casino Show, the Beef Week and Gold Cup races, gymkhanas and camp drafts but you can do so much more with it,” Cr Mustow said.
""The showgrounds belong to the community and we'd like to improve these facilities for everyone to use.”
Council is inviting public comment on the draft master plan, which can be viewed at Council's offices in Casino and Evans Head, or downloaded from Council's website www.richmondvalley.nsw.gov.au

"Swedish luxury automotive brand Volvo today launched the XC40, its smallest sports utility (SUV) in India, at an introductory price of Rs 39.9 lakh (ex-showroom).
This will be the tenth model by Volvo in India, and its third SUV. The XC40 has been on sale outside India since last year. Volvo is offering only one engine and one trim as of now on the XC40, a very unusual move as most launches start with at least three variants.
The XC40 will be powered by 2.0 litre diesel engine having a peak power of 190 bhp. The transmission is 8-speed, all-wheel drive and the top speed of the SUV is limited to 210 km/hr.
The XC40 will be competing against the Mercedes GLA, BMW X1 and Audi Q3 in a segment which clocks 6,000 units sales every year. The XC40 is wider, longer and taller than all its competitors.
Last calendar year, Volvo recorded sales of 2029 units, a growth of 28 percent compared to 1585 units sold in 2016. It had launched three new models – S60 Polestar, V90 Cross Country and XC60 – last year.
The Swedish company is aiming for a 10 percent market share in India’s luxury car market by 2020. The market is presently dominated by Mercedes-Benz followed by BMW, Audi and Jaguar Land Rover.
Volvo has about 21 dealers across the country and has plans to add one new dealer each month over the next five months.
Company officials said that it can look at a petrol variant later but since 90 percent of sales in this segment are diesel it has gone ahead with only a diesel engine.
Features
Some of the key features in the XC40, which are also an industry-first, are radar-based driving assistance, wireless mobile charging, park assist pilot, gesture-controlled tailgate, intersection braking, lane keeping aid, 9 inch centre display, panoramic sunroof and a 13 speaker Harman Kardon sound system.
It comes with premium black upholstery with contrasting door inserts. Steering wheel and gear knob gets leather stitching. In all the company is offering three colours on the XC40.
For now Volvo has decided to import fully built units of the new model as against starting production at the recently inaugurated assembly facility in Bengaluru. Volvo presently makes the XC90 and S90 (sedan) at the Indian facility. Very soon the XC60 will be added to the line-up. The XC60 makes up 25 percent of its domestic volumes.",www.moneycontrol.com,2018-07-05 00:00:00,22,651128
"A day after the Gokhale road overbridge in Andheri collapsed on Tuesday, it has been found that at least 60 utility cables ran below the paver blocks of the 3-m-wide bridge. Did the pressure weaken the bridge, leading to its collapse? The joint probe by the commissioner of railway safety (CRS), Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and railway officials will look to answer this question.
The 70-m-long Gokhale bridge, which was built in 1975, acted as a connector between Andheri East and West. Around 7.30am, a 3-m-wide slab from the pedestrians’ exit of the bridge gave away, leaving five people injured. A major disaster was, however, averted as a Churchgate-bound train leaving Andheri station was stopped metres ahead of the spot.
While a team of BMC and railway officials conducted a joint inspection of the site on Wednesday, both of them claimed they didn’t give permission for the utilities passing through the bridge. An official present with the team said, “Both the aspects – the permission and pressure –will be examined.”
The probe team has to submit a report within 15 days. “We need to check if the bridge was designed to carry utility cables. If not, the utility cables may have surely put pressure on the walkway. Before giving the permission, the design should have been considered. Initial inspection shows the bridge was old. It is possible that the load-bearing beams may have rusted, weakening the structure,” a civic engineer told HT on condition of anonymity, as the investigation is underway.
The bridge which is closed for both pedestrian (the other exit) and vehicular traffic is unlikely to be opened soon. “We will not open the bridge, until a thorough investigation convinces us that the structure is safe for use,” said a WR official on condition of anonymity.
Meanwhile, BMC, which has been planning to repair the bridge for two years, may invite tenders for the work. A routine inspection conducted two years ago concluded the girders (large iron beams) needed strengthening.",www.hindustantimes.com,2018-07-05 00:00:00,17,457228
"The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) may have begun the road repair works early this year, but it looks like there will be no respite from potholes for Thane residents. Most roads in the city have developed huge craters leading to traffic jams. The public works department of the TMC had promised good roads in at least three wards before monsoons, and over ₹2.5 crore was spent to ensure pothole-free roads. However, the promise did not hold up much through the recent showers.
Thane city has received 1,343.81mm of rainfall this year. The heavy rains of early this week, though, had led to potholes in several parts of the city. The corporation had repaired 37,216 metres of roads before monsoon this year. Most of the roads in the city too, were concretised and widened.
While the pothole situation in Thane might be better than the neighbouring corporations, some of the roads are still in bad condition.
A status check revealed that craters have appeared along the Waghbil Road, Manpada service road, Vasant Vihar Road, Saket Balkum Road, Gokhale Road, Charai, Teen Hath Naka, Korus Company junction and Wagale Estate, among others.
These potholes have increased the peak hour traffic woes of residents who are already facing congestion due to the ongoing repair works on the Mumbra Bypass road.
Harshada Vartak Sandhan, 35, a resident of Hiranandani Estate said, “I commute from Waghbil Road every day to drop my son to school. A fortnight ago they had repaired the road, however, it has immediately developed craters. Driving on the road is a nightmare, as the craters are huge and might cause an accident.”
Saeed Mulani, 33, another resident of Wagale Estate said, “Most roads in Wagale Estate have potholes. The roads in this industrial belt of the city are already narrow and potholes have only added to our nightmare. It is mad chaos on most of the roads during peak hours, especially road No 33 which has huge craters near the Kamgar Hospital. It is difficult to gauge the depth of these potholes when they are filled with water.”
Over the years, the corporation had experimented with various methods of filling potholes, from using the expensive jet patchers to different ready-mixes, however, none of them have proved effective. This year too, the TMC had planned to use Poly Ironite Ceramic Cementitious (PICC) coating, a water resistant concrete to fill the potholes. In most places, the potholes are filled using small stones and bricks.
A TMC official requesting anonymity said, “We will conduct a survey of the potholes once we get a dry spell. The number of potholes will further increase when the rain stops, as when the sun shines, the asphalt will wear off leading to more craters in the city.
“We are however fully equipped to deal with them. We have several plan of actions in place, we have appointed contractors in each of the wards who will immediately fill the potholes in a dry spell. We also have seven to eight different techniques for filling potholes. We will choose the filling mixture as per the requirement of each of the roads,” the official said.
He added that the TMC has allotted a budget of ₹2 crore to fill potholes during monsoon. “In case of roads which have completely failed like the Kamgar Hospital Road, we will close the entire road and repair it. One side of this road is concretised, so we will open that side for traffic and close the part of the road which has caved in, for repairs,” he said.",www.hindustantimes.com,2018-07-05 00:00:00,28,457073

Katkar’s family said her son had been asking about her. “He is too young to understand the tragedy and we haven’t told him anything. We told him that she has gone to stay with her brother for some days,” said her sister-in-law Anuradha Katkar.
“Plastic surgeons have taken a skin graft from her legs for her injured hand. We have stabilised the bone, but there are chances that she might lose her hand. It’s her head injury we are more concerned about,” said Dr Jairam Jagiasi, head of orthopaedic department at RN Cooper. He added that her hand injury had cut off all blood vessels and crushed the bone.
Neurosurgeons said they need three days to be assured that she is out of danger. “She moved her legs today, which was a positive sign, but the recovery has to continue for the next three days. The right part of her frontal lobe has suffered several contusions, which may result in certain behavioural changes, even if she recovers completely,” said Dr Shradha Maheshwari, neurosurgeon.
On the other hand, Rajesh Mehta, brother of Manoj, said that there was no change in his condition even after 24 hours. “Despite a surgery performed yesterday (Tuesday), there is no improvement in my brother’s condition,” said Rajesh.
Mehta’s relatives shifted him from RN Cooper Hospital to NSSH on Tuesday. “Prima facie, it was evident that Manoj has suffered an injury in his L1 (lumbar vertebrae region), and thus we had asked the family to take extreme precaution while moving him to another hospital. He has also suffered injuries on his head and face,” said Dr Maheshwari.
Doctors from NSSH said only after three days, they will be able to comment whether he is out of danger.

"Three years ago, in an incident similar to Tuesday’s bridge collapse at Andheri, a portion of a road overbridge came crashing down on railway tracks in Ahmedabad in October 2015.
That bridge was more than 50 years old, and an inquiry ordered soon after recommended a drive to inspect all overbridges on the Western Railways — which includes the Churchgate-Dahanu suburban sections, as well as other railway networks in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and a part of Madhya Pradesh.
Despite this recommendation, Western Railway does not seem to have learnt its lesson. Tuesday’s collapse in Mumbai injured five people and paralysed train services the whole day. Investigators are now looking into whether the weight of 60 utility cables laid under the three-metre wide bridge affected its stability.
Interestingly, the report written after the Ahmedabad incident in 2015 had also asked the WR to remove unauthorised cables passing under overbridges.
“Unauthorised cables laid and passing through ROB/FOB should be identified and removed /regularised duly, after recovery of charges, as per extent rules,” the report had said.
Had the Railways and BMC, which conducted a safety audit of the Andheri bridge last year, looked into the recommendations of the 2015 report and acted on it, the collapse could have been prevented, a senior official said, requesting not to be named.
However, AK Gupta, the general manager of the Western Railway, said: “Drives for checking bridges are done on a regular basis. After the October 2015 incident, there might have been a drive definitely conducted.” Other officials from the WR said utility cables may have affected the bridge’s stability, and other factors may have caused it further damage.
“The paver blocks, along with cables that went through the bridge, may have added extra weight on it. Water in the paver blocks and inside the structure could have resulted in corrosion of structure, which may have caused the collapse,” said a senior WR official, adding that the exact reason can only be ascertained after a probe.
As the BMC and Railways engage in a blame game, other experts pointed out that the structural damage may have gone unnoticed as the two bodies are responsible for different types of maintenance. “The structural part of the bridge is maintained by the Railways, but the surface of the bridge is maintained by the civic body. Once water seeps through the bridge it leads to corrosion in the steel foundation. During inspection, the outer structure might have looked fine, but the insides may have corroded,” said Subodh Jain, a retired senior railway officer and former member, engineering railway board.
Union railway minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday announced a detailed study of 445 bridges including road over bridges, bridges crossing the railway tracks and any infrastructure which is close to the tracks.",www.hindustantimes.com,2018-07-05 00:00:00,17,457056

"AN ARGUMENT between neighbours over the volume of a television that escalated to threats of violence with a machete has landed a Maclean man behind bars.
Troy Gary Currie, 34, pleaded not guilty in Grafton Local Court to charges of being armed with a weapon with intent to threaten or intimidate his neighbour during an argument on November 22.
Giving evidence at Currie's hearing, the victim said he went out the back door of his unit to complain to Currie over the volume of his TV. When he walked outside he found Currie at the victim's back door holding a machete, and threatening to cut him ""into little bits"".
""He scared the living crap out of me,"" the victim said.
The victim said he feared for his safety and returned straight to his house and called the police.
According to police facts tendered to the court, police arrived at the Maclean property 15-20 minutes later and questioned the witness and Currie. Police said that Currie denied owning a machete, but when they conducted a search of the unit block they found a machete, along with other knives and a hatchet stashed in a bush.
When asked about the knives, Currie denied owning them, but when police asked if his fingerprints would be found on them he said they were in fact his.
In his evidence, Currie said the victim did approach him to ask him to turn his TV down, but denied using the machete to threaten the victim. Currie said he was using the machete to crush cans at the back of his house, and denied verbally threatening the victim.
When asked about the machete, Currie said he took it back inside and hid it along with the other knives and originally told police he didn't have a machete out of fear.
After hearing the evidence, Magistrate Karen Stafford said she found the witness to be honest and reliable, and that the prosecution case had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
Ms Stafford said the offence was serious because it happened on the back doorstep of the victim's home, and found Currie guilty of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence. Currie was also sentenced over an assault on the same victim on February 19, where he struck the victim in the head, causing his glasses to fall from his face.
Currie was sentenced to an aggregate term of 16 months, with a non-parole period of six months. Currie will be eligible for release at the end of this month.",www.dailyexaminer.com.au,2018-07-05 00:00:00,17,692393

THE Westlawn Finance Black and Gold Race Day gets the 2018 July Racing Carnival under way today, with free entry into Clarence River Jockey Club for all from 10.30am.
And Australia's biggest and richest country racing carnival has upped the stakes this year, increasing its total prizemoney across the five race meetings by $80,000 to $1.37 million.
It makes sense that this will lure more provincial and metropolitan stables and therefore some of the strongest fields we've seen in recent years.
The biggest beneficiaries are two of the ""minor"" races on Ramornie Day and Grafton Cup Day. The Tursa Inglis 3YO Grafton Guineas on Wednesday goes from $50,000 to $80,000, and on Thursday an increase from $30,000 to $45,000 makes The Big Maiden Showcase Handicap the richest maiden race in NSW country and provincial racing.
The other beneficiary is the Grafton economy. The longer the carnival maintains its prestigious stand as the last traditional country racing carnival to hold five race meetings over 10 days, its reputation will continue to grow, which will only entice more visitors to the region.
We're all set to up the stakes here at the DEX too. On top of our regular carnival coverage including the eight-page Supaform race-day liftouts, we've invited acclaimed racing writer Geoff Newling to join our team for ""race week"", and keep an eye out for our souvenir wraps on the Ramornie Day and Grafton Cup Day editions.
Today's race meeting gives the small time trainers a chance to dream, with the winners of the John Carlton Cup and Grafton Cup Prelude earning direct entry into the Ramornie Handicap and Grafton Cup respectively.
And rest assured those qualifiers are not just there to make up the numbers. Remember this...

Leah Kilner gets ready for her first July racing carnival, riding Hydrazine for Stephen Lee in the John Carlton. Adam Hourigan
RACING: WHILE the pressure of her first July Carnival in the saddle might be weighing on the shoulders of Grafton apprentice jockey Leah Kilner, there would be no way of knowing it.
The 18-year-old was full of smiles and excitement as she looked toward today's John Carlton Cup, a prelude to the Ramornie Handicap.
Kilner will pilot stalwart gelding Hydrazine, out of the Stephen Lee yard at Ballina, in what will be her first run for the leading trainer.
It is a big mission for a jockey in the first year of her career, and one she is not taking lightly.
""It is a really good opportunity and I just want to take it in both hands and run,” Kilner said.
""This is a big time of the year, the carnival is world-renowned and there is definitely a few more expectations on us as jockeys.”
It has been a boom career start for the young jockey who has seen two weight claim reductions and scored 27 winners in her first seven months on track.
Kilner took her trade interstate for the first time last month, winning on board Charlee Bear (Greg Kilner) at the Beaudesert Cup meeting before also getting the nod from leading Queensland trainer Ben Currie at Toowoomba last weekend.
""It is insane, I have been blessed to be on some great horses and been given some great opportunities,” she said.
Hydrazine will carry 59.5kg first up from a spell when he jumps from barrier seven. The seven-year-old gelding has a decent first up record, and despite a recent trail off in form, Kilner is backing his experience.
""It is very exciting to get a ride in the John Carlton, and for it to be a good ride at that is great,” she said. ""He has been a good horse, and the results are there in his career, it is not an overly strong field so I think he should go alright.
""He has drawn a little bit awkward but he has a fair bit of pace. I just want to take the race as it comes.”",www.dailyexaminer.com.au,2018-07-05 00:00:00,16,692381
"RACING: There is just the hint of a glimmer in the eye of veteran Grafton trainer Neville Stewart when he talks about star gelding Jack Strikes Back.
Even though it is 25 years on, there is something in the gelding that reminds Stewart of a past stable champion: 1993 Grafton Cup winner Abstraction.
Much like his stable predecessor, Jack Strikes Back will aim to earn his way into the Grafton Cup through today's prelude on Westlawn Finance Black and Gold Race Day.
But despite the lofty expectations that come with the first race day of the Clarence River Jockey Club's July Racing Carnival, Stewart said the pressure is well and truly off his horse.
""We have been there done it before, it is just another race as far as I am concerned,” he said.
""We did it 25 years ago, and run second, then came out to win the Cup the next week. You never know this bloke might run second (today), and then turn up to win the Cup as well.”
The stayer was beaten by half a head this time last year on Ramornie Handicap Day, and Stewart said his eye had been on the Cup for the past couple of months.
""I thought about three months ago where can we head with him, and I thought he was in work so why not aim at the Grafton Cup,” he said.
""I wasn't sure he was even going to make the cut-off for the Prelude.
""Now we are in it, you sort of never know what could happen, we might win, go into the Cup to make up the numbers and win again there. Young Sally (Taylor) did it two years ago, so it is definitely possible.”
The gelding is in prime position for the race four starts back from a spell and aiming to make up for a poor performance at Port Macquarie last start. But he has got plenty of potential which Stewart said he showed the start before that run at the Gold Coast.
""I was disappointed at his last start,” Stewart said. ""He has continued on working well and really he should be about cherry ripe at his peak now.”
Despite the Cup Prelude not allowing for apprentice weight claims, Stewart has stuck with Grafton apprentice Olivia Pickering for the run.
He will lead the local hopes in the Prelude out of an awkward draw in barrier 10, with fellow local runner Stella's Chance (Wayne Lawson) on his outside in barrier 18.
""Wayne likes his horses to put on the pace, so I am hoping he gets out early and sort of drags us along behind him,” Stewart said. ""Anything can happen in this race.”",www.dailyexaminer.com.au,2018-07-05 00:00:00,17,692255

SMILING ASSASSINS: Ben Looker and Jenny Graham have been a partnership on fire this racing season, and will be linking again today in the Grafton Cup Prelude. Mark Evans
Grafton CUP PRELUDE: Fresh from raising the bat with a century of winners this season, Grafton-bred jockey Ben Looker is excited to be returning home for the biggest week of the year.
Since moving to Port Macquarie last year Looker has been in the form of his life, regularly racking up winners, including the $400,000 Country Championships final at Randwick on Victorem.
But it was his effort at Beaudesert just over a week ago that will rank high for the jockey. The Beaudesert Cup win on Allknight Saint was his fourth for the day and the 100th of his career.
""It was just an awesome day in the saddle. I was going in to Beaudesert on 96 thinking there might be a chance to bring up 100 at home during Cup week,” he said.
""Next thing I have ridden four winners and I was there. To have the 100th win be the Beaudesert Cup was special as well. I am just proud of all I have achieved this season.”
But the work is far from over for the 27-year-old, who has his sights on the Grafton Cup.
His first stop is the Grafton Cup Prelude (2215m), where he will rekindle his highly successful partnership with Port trainer Jenny Graham.
Looker will pilot the in-form Art Attack in the Prelude hoping to capitalise on recent success at Grafton.
""He is going to be really hard to beat, his form lately you can't fault it,” Looker said. ""He was beaten by the bob of a head at Coffs Harbour last start, and now he comes back to Grafton carrying the minimum (54kg).
""If he was to come out and win the Prelude, I don't think he would disgrace himself in the Cup either. It is such a big prize, I reckon Jenny would have to take a shy at the stumps.”
Looker has a strong book of rides at Grafton today, also earning the sit on John Carlton Cup (1205m) topweight Just A Bullet for Brett Cavanough.
Looker will also take the reins on 2YO Maiden Plate (1006m) runner Casual Witness for leading Queensland trainer Tony Gollan.
""It's great to be getting rides for the big stables over the carnival,” he said. ""I am in good form at the moment, but that is because I have had a fair bit of support behind me.”
Casual Witness, the latest in a long line of successful runners by champion sire Star Witness, will be having her first start after winning a recent trial at Doomben.",www.dailyexaminer.com.au,2018-07-05 00:00:00,20,692548
"THE Clarence Valley continues to buck a trend of falling development approvals for dwellings in Australia.
While the figures for the number of dwellings approved nationally fell by 1.5per cent in May 2018 in trend terms, according to data released this week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, local housing approvals have been booming.
Clarence Valley Council figures for approved dwellings show approvals have nearly doubled in the past five years.
Earlier this year, CVC general manager Ashley Lindsay said the council approved $100,518,672 worth of applications between July 1, 2017, and April 30 this year.
The council confirmed yesterday this figure had grown to more than $119million by the end of June.
Mr Lindsay said the $100million figure had been reached before, but he believed it was the earliest in the financial year it had happened.
The ABS said the fall in approvals for dwellings in May was driven by factors outside of housing approvals.
""Dwelling approvals have weakened in May, driven by a 2.6per cent fall in private dwellings excluding houses,” said ABS director of construction statistics Justin Lokhorst.
Among the states and territories, dwelling approvals in May fell in Queensland (4.2per cent), Victoria (2.7per cent), Tasmania (2per cent) and Western Australia (0.8per cent) in trend terms.

CUP PRELUDE: Queensland stayer Chillin With Dylan, who retired last year after repeated tendon issues, will stage an amazing comeback to racing if he can land Thursday's Westlawn Finance Grafton Cup Prelude (2200m).
Beaudesert trainer Ben Ahrens has worked hard getting his former promising stayer back to the track this year and believes the rising seven-year-old should acquit himself well at his fifth run back and stepping up to the more suitable 2215m of the Grafton race.
Ahrens always had a high opinion of the Dylan Thomas gelding, who ran some terrific races as a three-year-old during the 2015 Brisbane winter carnival.
He ran third to Worthy Cause and Upham in the Group Three Gunsynd Classic (1800m) at the Gold Coast, then ran good races in his next three starts at Doomben - a fourth to Sadlers Lake in the Group Three Rough Habit Plate (2000m), a close fourth to Upham in the Group Three Grand Prix Stakes (2020m) and a 3.4 length 10th to Magicool in the Group One Queensland Derby (2200m).
Chillin With Dylan returned as a four-year-old and was progressing nicely, winning three of his next five starts before disaster struck after his last win over 2200m at Doomben on November 28, 2015.
""We were getting him ready to take to Sydney when he bowed a tendon and that was the end of that,” said Ahrens.
""He was off the scene for more than a year and we brought him back (in January, 2017) and the near-side tendon flared up again so we retired him after that one comeback run.
""But we couldn't really find a suitable home for him and after about eight months I had another look at him. I thought his leg looked okay so I thought I'd give him another try. I just brought him along very slowly and so far he's stood up to racing just fine.”
Chillin With Dylan finally returned to racing at the Gold Coast in May, finishing 10th behind Divine Unicorn over 1400m.
He made steady progress in his next couple of runs and improved at his fourth run back at Toowoomba on last month when third to Kincaple Chief and Charles The Third.
""All of his four runs have been pretty good actually,” Ahrens said. ""He obviously is looking for the longer trip now and the Grafton track should really suit him. He's got to carry 60kg on Thursday, but he's earned it.
""All being well, hopefully we can also have a crack at next week's Grafton Cup as well.”
Chillin With Dylan has drawn gate two in today's 14-horse Prelude field and will be partnered by Brad Stewart. The winner of the Cup Prelude is exempt from the ballot for next week's Grafton Cup.",www.dailyexaminer.com.au,2018-07-05 00:00:00,18,692365

"As the laundering allegations balloon, public indignation towards Danske is mounting. The government and central bank say the case risks hurting the reputation of the whole country.
Copenhagen
DANSKE Bank A/S's Estonian operations may have been used to launder as much as US$8.3 billion in a case that has rocked Denmark and triggered calls for tougher penalties from the country's political establishment.
The amount, which represents roughly a third of Danske's market value and almost 3 per cent of the Danish GDP, is more than double that previously estimated, according to figures first reported by Berlingske and confirmed by Bloomberg. The alleged illicit transactions span the years 2007 to 2015.
Shares in Denmark's biggest bank opened more than 3 per cent lower in Copenhagen on Wednesday, making Danske the day's worst performer in the Bloomberg index of European financial stocks, which was little changed.
sentifi.com Market voices on:
""It's not clear what the consequences might be as the volume of this case is much bigger than anyone could have imagined,"" said Christian Thatje, an equity dealer at Sydbank A/S. ""This case brings a lot of uncertainty and investors don't like that.""
Danske Bank's riskiest euro and dollar bonds also lost ground on Wednesday morning. The 7 per cent dollar contingent convertible bond dropped a cent to 97.1 cents on the dollar, while the 5.76 per cent euro CoCo fell to its lowest level since January 2017.
It is not known who exactly is behind the transactions, but previous leaks showed money made its way from Russia, Moldova and Azerbaijan through Danske's laundromat. The laundering is also thought to have involved funds linked to an illicit scheme exposed by Sergei Magnitsky, an auditor who died in custody in Russia in 2009.
Bill Browder, who was expelled from Russia in 2005 after his firm Hermitage Capital Management released documents it said exposed corporate and government corruption, said he will use the latest allegations against Danske as the basis for an official complaint.
""We are working on a new criminal complaint including these discoveries, which we intend to file with the Danish and Estonian law enforcement authorities shortly,"" Mr Browder said by e-mail on Wednesday.
Danske Bank expects to release the findings of an internal investigation of the money laundering breaches in September. Before Wednesday, the bank had said that it could not comment fully until the results of that probe are ready.
After the latest allegations, Danske's head of group compliance Anders Meinert Jorgensen said: ""It is too soon to draw any conclusions about the extent of the potential money laundering in Estonia ... That is the reason why we have not ourselves published figures or commented on speculations about potential amounts. On several occasions, however, we have said that the extent seems to be somewhat larger than previously estimated,"" he said by e-mail.
The bank is continuing to cooperate with the authorities and provide material ""on an ongoing basis to the extent that this has not already been done"", Mr Jorgensen said.
Jesper Nielsen, head of banking in Denmark at Danske and a member of the executive board, said the laundering investigation is taking up a ""big chunk of management's time"", in an interview conducted before the latest allegations became public.
""Obviously it takes some time and gives us some worries in terms of how we are perceived in the market,"" Mr Nielsen said. ""This impacts the story around Danske Bank.""
Denmark's business minister Rasmus Jarlov said this week that the bank's internal probe won't be enough to satisfy the government, and said he was awaiting the findings of other investigations. The government and central bank have said the case risks hurting the reputation of the whole country, which has otherwise been associated with extremely low levels of corruption.
Danske was reprimanded in May by the Financial Supervisory Authority in Copenhagen and ordered to hold an additional five billion kroner (S$1.07 billion) in regulatory capital, among other disciplinary measures.
Chief executive officer Thomas Borgen has publicly apologised for the bank's failure to act sooner. Last month, he revealed that he had even discussed with the board the option of stepping down. But the board concluded he should remain so that the bank could draw on his experience to avoid a repeat.
Denmark is in the process of tightening its laundering laws in response to the Danske scandal, but Mr Jarlov has lamented the fact that it won't be possible to apply the legislation retroactively.
As the size of the laundering allegations balloons, public indignation towards Danske is mounting. Per Hansen, an investment economist at Nordnet, says the latest figures ""of course place an increasing amount of pressure on the executive management"" at Danske.
Before Wednesday, the stock reaction had been relatively muted. But ""investors are responding this time, given the sheer size of the scandal"", said Mr Thatje at Sydbank. ""It's the biggest known ongoing money laundering case worldwide and that's putting pressure on the management and raises questions about what the consequences will be.""

"Mr Yi, just a few months into his new job, has his work cut out for him, especially with the growing trade war with the US.
Beijing
CHINA'S central bank is caught in a bind, as it seeks to tighten monetary policy for some parts of the economy while loosening it for others.
Already engaged in the mammoth task of wringing bad debts out of China's US$40 trillion-plus financial system, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) is now attempting to achieve that while simultaneously being asked to bolster flagging growth and rescue falling stock markets.
That would be a tough enough feat for any central banker, but the outlook for PBOC governor Yi Gang just a few months into his new job is even more complicated: A growing trade war with the Trump administration coupled with rising borrowing costs in the US has prompted investors to sell the yuan heavily, raising the prospect of the central bank having to defend it.
sentifi.com Market voices on:
""The pressure of monetary policy to balance domestic and external stability is big, and room to manoeuvre is becoming even smaller,"" Xu Zhong, director general of the PBOC Research Bureau, said at a forum in Beijing last week. ""Monetary policy can't do everything, especially under conditions where external shocks are constantly increasing.""
That's quite a change of outlook from the first few months of this year when trade and the economy looked strong, with growth in 2017 having accelerated for the first time since 2010. That had put gradual tightening of PBOC policy on the agenda.
Now, an economic slowdown has deepened - a gauge of June export orders tumbled into contraction even before the US imposes additional tariffs - putting the brakes on those plans.
Stocks had their worst quarter in more than two years in the three months through June, and the yuan is falling as the US Federal Reserve is stepping up the pace of interest rate hikes, leading a global tightening cycle that's pushed the dollar up. And on top of that, China's drive to curb indebtedness at state firms and local governments remains a policy priority.
The PBOC is, as a result, busy. Since April, Mr Yi has announced plans to cut banks' reserve requirements twice, widened the collateral pool for liquidity operations, and held off from a widely anticipated increase in inter-bank borrowing costs that would have paced the Fed's June rate hike.
As both the RRR cuts had specific purposes attached to them, economists still can't agree whether the PBOC is easing policy in general or not.
With household and corporate indebtedness high, corporate bond defaults heading for a record year amid slower growth, the risk is that the PBOC may be trying to do too much. It may either struggle to balance debt risks with growth threats, or just focus on one problem to the exclusion of the others.
The PBOC's room for manoeuvre is also limited by the plunging currency, as that will put a cap on how far officials can loosen domestic policy to assist in a slowdown.
According to Nie Wen, an economist at Huabao Trust Co in Shanghai, that fact risks forming a ""vicious cycle"" if left unaddressed by officials, as slower expansion will weigh on the yuan, which in turn hurts purchasing power of the economy.
Part of the focus on the PBOC is because policymakers are trying to keep the fiscal purse strings tight. The government adopted a lower budget deficit target for this year, though they have hinted that there's room for more public spending should the economy run into difficulty.
For now, officials want to avoid reviving the old stimulus favourites, such as splurging on government-backed infrastructure projects or loosening property purchase curbs. Instead, it has slashed taxes for imported goods to encourage domestic consumption.
The PBOC is now expected to hold the seven-day reverse repo rate, which guides inter-bank borrowing costs, unchanged at 2.55 per cent till the end of 2018, according to a Bloomberg survey on economists from June 15 to June 21. That's a significant dialling back from expectations of tightening just a month earlier.
Meanwhile, economists also expect the central bank to come up with more targeted tools, in an attempt to aid parts of the economy without flooding the financial system with cash. The bigger the slowdown, the more the PBOC's political masters will be tempted to open the taps.
On the flip-side, keeping financial policy tight in order to gain ground in the deleveraging campaign risks hurting the economy.
""Pipelining these priorities is a tricky game,"" said Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Bank Ltd in Hong Kong. ""One mistake could cause big risks, and it's just easy to make mistakes."" BLOOMBERG",www.businesstimes.com.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,30,693993
"The Bank of England(above) is championing the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average, or Sonia, as an alternative because it tracks the rates of actual overnight funding deals and is therefore considered harder to manipulate.
[LONDON] It took a full year for banks to design and sell a bond tied to the UK's replacement for Libor. Now the pioneers of that deal are preparing to use it as a model for a much broader client base.
They may have uncovered a lucrative opportunity. Such was the strength of demand when the European Investment Bank sold the Sonia-linked notes last month that it was able to raise £1 billion (S$1.8 billion), from a mooted target of at least £250 million. Order books on the deal, which was arranged by HSBC Holdings Plc, NatWest Markets, Royal Bank of Canada and TD Securities Inc, closed above £1.55 billion. The securities strengthened in the secondary market after the sale.
""We have a template,"" said Mark Byrne, director of syndicate at TD Securities, one of the first two banks brought in to conduct the EIB bond sale. ""We can take, for the most part, what the EIB has done, and use it for other issuers willing to follow suit.""
Nobody is saying the bond pipeline will immediately swell to bursting point. But more deals seem inevitable, given a global regulatory effort to shift pricing away from the London Interbank Offered Rate, known as Libor, after it emerged some lenders had been attempting to rig the gauge for years. The Bank of England is championing the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average, or Sonia, as an alternative because it tracks the rates of actual overnight funding deals and is therefore considered harder to manipulate.
sentifi.com Market voices on:
It would be a welcome trend for bank syndicates that are seeking ways to boost revenue in fixed income, currencies and commodities amid a slowdown in trading. Adding to their woes, sales of high-grade corporate bonds in Europe fell 30 per cent to £149 billion in the first half. In contrast, sterling floating-rate issuance enjoyed the best opening half since 2009, with £22 billion of the securities priced, Bloomberg data show.
The Sonia benchmark ought to replace Libor as ""the norm"" on floating-rate notes by 2019, said Asif Sherani, co-head of SSA and FIG DCM syndicate at HSBC, who helped arrange the EIB issue. ""We are definitely pitching this to clients to make sure they understand how Sonia-linked floaters work,"" he said.
That'll be music to the ears of regulators, including the BOE's Mark Carney, who have been warning of the challenges posed by a migration away from Libor, which still underpins US$370 trillion of instruments across various currencies. Officials said last year they'll stop compelling banks to submit Libor quotes after 2021.
""Market participants in every sector and market that use Libor now need to come together to identify and resolve issues, change business practices, and adopt alternative benchmarks,"" Mr Carney said at a conference in London in May. A reformed Sonia now forms the basis for £50 billion of transactions a day, he said, adding that he expected floating-rate bonds and loans using the benchmark to appear.
New York Federal Reserve President Bill Dudley called the shift away from Libor a ""clear risk to financial stability"" and a ""monumental and complicated effort"" that will ""entail overcoming many obstacles.""
Nonetheless, minutes from the latest industry-led working group on sterling risk-free reference rates released on Wednesday show members believe a ""robust"" term Sonia rate ""could facilitate benchmark transition for an important set of end users,"" particularly in loan and debt capital markets.
The EIB notes, the first benchmark-sized securities tied to Sonia, took longer than usual to arrange. Computer systems and models needed to be adapted to support the pricing structure because interest on the Sonia-linked securities will be compounded daily. Such minutiae may slow the deal flow for other issuers.
Due to the complexity of the arrangements, ""I don't think there's a trade due to happen"" in the coming weeks, TD Securities' Byrne said. But an outline for future deals and a ""realistic alternative"" to Libor-linked floating rate note deals is now in place, which banks will probably join the supranational EIB in using. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see covered bonds move this way at some point as well,"" he said.
The EIB's deal has made a winning start, with the notes' spread tightening about two and a half basis points to around 32.5 basis points since pricing on June 22, according to Bloomberg data.
In the US, Libor's administrators are fighting to preserve its status as the premier global benchmark for dollar-based assets with a shift to a so-called waterfall methodology. Investment-grade corporate bond sales in the U.S. so far this year have reached US$640 billion, down 10.4 per cent on the US$714 billion raised in the first half of 2017, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Even ""issuers based in the US that won't ever actually do a sterling trade"" paid attention to the EIB sale, Mr Byrne said. They are ""looking to see what they can learn from this for any future potential non-Libor FRNs in other markets.""

"Research has shown there is greater prejudice among older adults.
This is often dismissed as older people being “from a different time,” but this is not the whole story.
As we get older, certain parts of our brain shrink, making us less inhibited.
So older people may just be saying things they wouldn’t normally say.
In other cases, they may have just always been that way.
It’s up to the people close to the elderly to decide whether their remarks are meant maliciously or not.
It’s become something of a national meme in the UK that 97-year-old Prince Philip might say something culturally insensitive when he’s out in public. Similarly, people may find their grandparents say more unpalatable things as they get older.
These remarks are brushed off because older people “are from a different time,” and “it’s a different world to the one they grew up in.” But while this may be partially true, it’s not the full story.
Research has shown that young people are increasingly less racist than older people. For example, in 1958, just 4% of Americans approved of interracial marriage. This support only reached 50% in 1997, while now it is at 87%.
But the old prejudices of yesteryear don’t encompass racism entirely. Sometimes it can reveal itself with an ill-judged joke, or subtle racial stereotyping. As people age, their ability to judge what is or isn’t appropriate may falter, causing them to blurt out something others consider insensitive. (Although, others are simply born that way, and age has nothing to do with it.)
We spoke to psychologists about the possible reasons for inherent racism, and what the current research says about why people’s behaviours alter as they age. There is never an excuse for being outright offensive, but when you are close to older people, context can be important in judging whether it’s something you want to address directly, or let go.
Where racism comes from
Some scientists think there may be a biological or evolutionary basis to racism or prejudice because they see it as a reaction to a competition for resources. But there isn’t a huge amount of evidence for this.
Rather, the reasons for racism are probably psychological; feeling a lack of security, a need for identity, a desire for belonging, and feeling threatened by other groups – insecurities that may increase as someone gets older.
If you don’t like things about yourself, it’s a lot easier to project that onto others than to look at yourself.
One reason in particular for this insecurity is that older people are closer to death, said Steve Taylor, a senior lecturer in psychology at Leeds Beckett University. There’s a theory in psychology called terror management theory, he explained, and it essentially means that when people are more aware of their mortality, they become more naturalistic, materialistic, and conventional.
“They cling to the traditions and the conventions of their society in a stronger way,” Taylor said. “The theory is when you think of death it creates a fear, and one way of reacting to that anxiety is to cling to identity, to try and gain a sense of belonging, or even a sense of protection.”
For some, that comfort of belonging is found in the solidarity of hating others. Psychotherapist Allison Abrams told Business Insider people who relate to a hate group, such as neo-nazis, form strong bonds based on resentment.
“It’s a distorted way to find a sense of belonging, but that’s one thing that motivates people who fall into this category,” she said. “If you don’t like things about yourself, it’s a lot easier to project that onto others than to look at yourself… Especially if somebody has low self-esteem or has a lot of self-hatred.”

When people look or act differently to you, or come from somewhere else, it can be easier to use them as a scapegoat, by identifying them as a target to direct that anger and hatred towards.
Older people may feel their sense of identity is threatened if the world around them has changed a lot, such as when people from different countries and backgrounds move into their hometowns.
They may struggle to keep up with the world and feel as though they understand it less and less. This can be scary, and in retaliation, they may lash out at “the other” because it helps secure their sense of belonging.
When you’re older, your mental structure is a bit more rigid, so you struggle to adapt in the same way
“You can never really underestimate the importance of the need for identity,” said Taylor. “It’s a really powerful psychological need… There’s just a general feeling of anxiety in the air that creates this need for identity and belonging, and this need to demonise other groups.”
There is something to be said for older people being from a generation where prejudiced views were more explicit – such as growing up during the times of segregation.
“But that’s only part of it, because the research says even if people grew up in that era and had those attitudes, they can learn and they can become more liberal,” Abrams said. “We have that ability as humans – our personalities change, and we can become more open.”
Brains atrophy as we age
But that openness doesn’t last forever. As people age, their flexibility declines, and they are less able to adapt and absorb like they could when they were young.
“When you’re older, your mental structure is a bit more rigid, so you struggle to adapt in the same way,” said Taylor. “And if you can’t adapt it creates a sense of alienation, a sense of being overwhelmed and not fitting in.”
Research has shown that older adults have a tendency to be more prejudiced than their younger counterparts, even when they appear unprejudiced throughout their earlier lives. This wouldn’t make sense if people were only reacting to what they experienced when they were young.
Instead, the reasons could be biological. Abrams said the latest scientific theory for this is because areas of the brain going through changes as we age.
“Our prefrontal cortex starts to atrophy,” she said. “In other words, the frontal lobes lose their sharpness.”
That’s the part of our brain that control executive functioning, like our ability to reason, to use logic and judgement, to apply filters, and inhibit inappropriate thoughts.
Everyone gets strange ideas popping into their heads that they’d rather not say. Most of us are able to control these thoughts, but as that cognitive ability starts to decline, you may find older adults blurting out things they might have kept to themselves in the past. It’s a bit like having Tourette’s syndrome, in that you have less control over what comes out of your mouth.
“They may have said them anyway, depending on their personality when they were younger,” said Abrams. “But for the most part, they probably wouldn’t have… Once we reach that old age where our brains start to lose that ability, those more hidden parts, those more subconscious thoughts, we are less able to inhibit them.”
This isn’t to say everyone is secretly racist. But as psychologist William von Hippel puts it in an article on the BBC website, it may not be the case that our inhibitory abilities suppress our personality. Rather, they actually shape it.
caption Research has shown being over the age of 65 is one of the happiest times in human life. source Rawpixel.com / Shutterstock
Older people may appear more racist, or more prejudiced, but it’s not necessarily malicious or hateful. Sometimes it is, but not in every case, said Abrams.
“It could be that they hold these very negative views, and maybe they were racist and maybe they did say inappropriate things, and now it’s just amplified. It’s hard to know,” she said.
There are two roads to go down
There is a growing sense of alienation between the young and the old, said Taylor. Especially looking at political differences such as the Brexit vote, or the rift between conservative and liberal voters in the US and UK.
In some areas of the world, older people are valued and respected. But in Western culture, it tends to be the opposite.
… just because somebody was born in an era that was less tolerant… doesn’t mean that they are set in their ways.
“It’s a very youth-obsessed culture, old age is seen as a process of decay where you lose your attractiveness, lose your productivity,” Taylor said. “There does seem to be this schism between the young and the old.”
This could be a factor in older people wanting to “say what they feel” more often, to get back at an oversensitive younger generation which is leaving them behind. This isn’t likely to be the case for the majority of people, but it’s worth pointing out.
According to the work of developmental psychologist Erik Erikson, there are two roads people can go down as they age. One is to go towards bitterness and anxiety, by complaining about the world today, and how much better things were in the past.
The other road is one of acceptance and wisdom, where people let go of the things that don’t matter and feel more at peace with the world. After all, research has shown being over the age of 65 is one of the happiest times in human life – rivaled only by the late teens and early 20s.
So there is no absolute rule that people get judgmental and resentful as they get older. But for those who do, whether they start saying what they say out of bitterness, fear, or a cognitive decline, isn’t going to be all that certain.
Research is helping us to understand that if someone you’re close to says something completely inappropriate, there may be a biological factor to it. This understanding may provide the context to be able to reduce the schism between the young and the old, rather than writing older people off completely.
“The fact that just because somebody was born in an era that was less tolerant or there was more prejudice explicitly, doesn’t mean that they are set in their ways,” said Abrams. “It’s not always the case that if you’re an older person you’re doomed and you’re not going to change. Especially as we progress in society and become less ignorant. Well, most of us.”",www.businessinsider.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,76,233153

Theresa May’s Work and Pensions Secretary, Esther McVey, faces calls to resign over suggestions she “misled” parliament over the government’s landmark Universal Credit scheme which overhauls the benefits system.
McVey is under pressure to step down following an explosive letter from the government spending watchdog, which accuses McVey of making “incorrect” claims about the government’s new benefits scheme in parliament.
The head of the spending watchdog said that McVey had refused to meet him, misrepresented his report, and suggested her claim that Universal Credit is working “has not been proven.”
McVey apologises for “inadvertently misleading” MPs.
LONDON – The UK Work and Pensions Secretary has been forced to apologise for “misleading” Parliament following an explosive letter from the government spending watchdog, which accused her of making “incorrect” claims about the government’s new benefits scheme.
The extraordinary letter from the National Audit Office (NAO) came after she disowned its highly critical report on Universal Credit, the government’s troubled attempt to overhaul the benefits system, the roll-out of which McVey is responsible for.
McVey, the work and pensions secretary, told MPs last week that the damning study – which highlighted the severe financial problems caused for claimants by delays in receiving payments under the new system – was out-of-date.
But Auditor General Sir Amyas Morse took the highly unusual step of writing an open letter to McVey to rebut her claims and to “clarify the facts,” suggesting the report had been “fully agreed” with senior officials at her department days earlier.
He said McVey had refused to meet him, misrepresented his report, and said her claim that Universal Credit is working “has not been proven.”
McVey denied intending to mislead Parliament.
“While speaking in parliament in answer to questions to the NAO I mistakenly said the NAO had asked for the rollout of universal credit to be continued at a faster rate and be speeded up,” she told the Commons.
“In fact, the NAO did not say that Mr Speaker and I want to apologise to you and the House for inadvertently misleading you.”
“McVey appears to have misled parliament”
Margaret Greenwood MP, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said McVey should “consider her position.”
“This is a very serious matter,” Greenwood said.
“Esther McVey appears to have misled parliament in misrepresenting the findings of the NAO report,” Greenwood said.
“She sought to rubbish the NAO report, rather than respond to its findings, which were damning of her government’s flagship social security policy, even though her own department had agreed [on] the report prior to its publication.
Things have reached a new low when the National Audit Office accuses a Cabinet Minister of lying.
Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “Things have reached a new low when the National Audit Office accuses a Cabinet Minister of lying.”
“Universal Credit is failing, and if Esther McVey is not up to the job of sorting it out – as seems to be the case – then she has to go,” Lucas said.
The Ministerial code states that “[it] is of paramount importance that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity.
“Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister.”
Morse also indicated in the letter that McVey had knowingly agreed to the contents of the NAO’s report before she disowned it before MPs in Parliament.
“Our report was fully agreed with senior officials in your department,” he wrote.
“It is based on the most accurate and up-to-date information from your department.
“Your department confirmed this to me in writing on 6 June and we then reached final agreement on the report by 8 June.
“It is odd that by 15 June you felt able to say the NAO ‘did not take into account the impact of our recent changes’,” he added.",www.businessinsider.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,20,233183

The Colombia national soccer team was dumped out of the World Cup on Tuesday.
Colombia lost to England after a nail-biting penalty shootout, a result that led to vile death threats on social media.
The concerning messages arrived on the 24th anniversary of Andrés Escobar’s murder, the Colombia defender who was shot on Bogota’s streets, reportedly in retaliation for scoring an own goal at the 1994 tournament.

The brother of a Colombian soccer player shot six times on the streets of Bogota in 1994 fears for the lives of the country’s 2018 World Cup stars.
The Colombian national soccer team was dumped out of the competition on Tuesday after England held its nerve in the penalty shootout.
Colombia now returns home – and one man fears for their lives. That man is Sachi Escobar, the brother of 1994 World Cup player Andrés Escobar.
Escobar was the Colombia defender who scored an own goal in a World Cup group match against the United States – a mishap that eventually helped usher the country out of the tournament.
Escobar was murdered on July 1, 1994. He was shot six times, reportedly in retaliation for the own goal he had scored 10 days earlier.
Speaking before Colombia’s failure on Tuesday, Sachi Escobar expressed concern for the family of Carlos Sanchez, the midfielder who conceded two penalties in the build-up to the team’s final match against England, last night. Sanchez has received threats via social media.
“As a brother who has gone through this, I know what must be going through their heads, and I wouldn’t want anyone to go through that,” he said to Colombian media, via Joe. “Carlos must be feeling both sad for the mistake he made, and very afraid, and his family too.
“My brother never received any threats, they just shot him dead in the most cowardly way.”

Colombian pair Mateus Uribe and Carlos Bacca both missed penalties in the national team’s failed shootout against England, and both were targetted with hateful messages according to Mail Online.
The concerning messages ranged from warnings not to return to Colombia, to calling for their death. Colombia’s loss and the consequent death threats arrived on the 24th anniversary of Escobar’s death.
“The fact that people are still allowed to say these things on social network sites, even threaten him with death, making players and their families fear for their lives, shows me that nothing good came out of Andres’ death, nothing was learned,” Sachi Escobar said.
“These people are just low-life who are not real Colombian football fans, who should be arrested and thrown into jail. But despite what happened to Andres there are still no laws in the country to stop them.”",www.businessinsider.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,24,233115

Costco and Sam’s Club are extremely popular in the United States, and while memberships are needed to buy items, the food courts are open to all.
We decided to compare the food from two of the biggest bulk retail chains in the country: Costco and Sam’s Club.
Both had nearly identical set-ups and price points, but Costco’s larger selection and shockingly good quality won out in the end.
Costco and Sam’s Club are shining basilicas of American bulk shopping.
Within their hallowed – and exclusive – corrugated-metal-and-concrete walls, shoppers grab pounds of pasta and peanut butter amid miles of aisles of marked-down goods.
There is virtually nothing that isn’t offered by these warehouse giants – coffins, cars, even vacation packages can be purchased through their services. And even Amazon can’t stand in the way of bulk efficiency, as Costco’s most recent quarterly earnings report showed.
And no matter which warehouse store you’re shopping in, you’re bound to get hungry. Luckily, both Costco and Sam’s Club have mini food courts to satiate hungry shoppers. While they may look rather bare-bones, make no mistake: under the right circumstances, the food can be shockingly good.
We visited a Costco food court and were floored by the quality and downright deliciousness of some of the options – it was suspiciously good. So, we decided to head over to one of Costco’s biggest competitors, Sam’s Club, to find out if its food could beat the best:
First, a recap of Costco’s highlights.

Costco has a fairly large amount on its menu considering it’s a tiny kitchen hidden within a bulk retailer.

This entire spread – cheese pizza, hot dog, three different sandwiches, a quasi-stromboli, a soda, and a churro – cost just over $25. That’s pretty impressive.
The pizza is fine, but nothing astounding.

It’s a large, doughy, slice that’s similar in taste to Pizza Hut – salty, with a slightly sweet sauce. It’s nothing special, but for $1.99, I wasn’t complaining.

For $1.50 – it comes with a soda, even – it’s perhaps the best deal on the menu. And oddest of all, it’s delicious. I’ve never had a hot dog this satisfying anywhere, so to find this in a Costco in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, is all the more astounding.
Customers have the option to add ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, and sauerkraut (upon request) to the supersized dog.
source Hollis Johnson
The bun is fluffy and sweet, but it holds up to even the juiciest assaults of relish, mustard, and ketchup without succumbing to sogginess.
When we visited, the rotating menu item was an Italian sausage sandwich.
source Hollis Johnson
It wasn’t spectacular, but it wasn’t awful either. The bun, which was perfect with the hot dog, couldn’t hold up to the super juicy onions and peppers, leaving a soggy mess. The sausage itself was cooked well, charred on the outside like a properly grilled sausage, but it lacked some spicy oomph.
Then, I stumbled upon the hidden gem of the Costco menu: the BBQ brisket sandwich.
source Hollis Johnson
Let me preface this. One walks into Costco not even expecting food; the fact that they serve food is a surprise unto itself. One doesn’t expect the food to be all that great, considering everything is under $5 and it looks like a roadside hot dog shack dragged inside a warehouse. And that’s a fair assumption, frankly. But the food surprises you! It’s generally good.
In comes the BBQ brisket sandwich.
It’s enormous. It’s cheap. It’s one of the best sandwiches ever.
source Hollis Johnson
Its unassuming brioche-style bun is piled high with tender brisket and coleslaw. The meat literally tumbles out of the sandwich – it’s served with a cardboard belt around it to keep it in.
The meat is melt-in-your-mouth good. It’s velvety, fatty, and rich — I’m not a barbecue expert by any means, so take this with a grain of salt, but I think it’s purely divine.
source Hollis Johnson
The coleslaw adds a nice, crisp crunch and vinegary bite to help balance the savory notes.
Overall, Costco’s food is weirdly impressive.
source Hollis Johnson
There are a few odd moments – the pizza is lackluster, the Italian sausage was so-so – but overall, it’s better than anyone initially expects. Not only that, most of the food is beyond acceptable, it’s good. And the brisket sandwich – well, that is great.
So how does Sam’s Club stack up?
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
The set-up is virtually the same – there’s not much room for innovation when it comes to warehouse-store food joints.
Sam’s Club has less food, but a similar price point.
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
These five items cost just under $11 in total – not bad, considering just one item is a meal unto itself.
First, the pizza.
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
I went for pepperoni this time. It’s another enormous slice with enough real estate for 12 slices of pepperoni on it. That’s a veritable pizza estate.
The slice is floppy, and each bite feels kind of rubbery. The dough is chewy with no crispiness whatsoever.
And the grease — good lord, the grease. Pools and pools of grease.
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
It’s practically the sixth Great Lake. While the pepperoni is plentiful and decent, it’s not enough to save this pizza slice from sub-par mediocrity. Costco’s isn’t great, but it’s better than this.
The hot dog isn’t that bad at all, and just like Costco’s, it’s an amazing deal.
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
For $1.50 – same as Costco – you get a hot dog and a soda. And while hot dogs on their own don’t amount to much, this is a pretty large dog. Not as large as Costco’s, but close.
But this all-beef dog doesn’t have as much flavor as Costco’s; it’s a rather bland dog, even with condiments added.
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
The bun is your run-of-the-mill hot dog bun; no more, no less.
The special this time was, by sheer coincidence, sausage, onion, and pepper sandwiches — the exact same thing Costco offered.
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
Plus, the comparison was easy. Costco’s version was messy but good; this version is easy but boring. The bun is extremely chewy bread, and it overwhelms everything within it.
There aren’t enough peppers or onions, and the pork sausage is salty and dense.
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
The whole thing is on the dry side – I needed a drink to help wash it down.
Then, something I didn’t see at Costco: a cheeseburger.
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
And not just any cheeseburger: a bacon cheeseburger, for $2.99. My interest was immediately piqued.
It’s weird, but fairly good.
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
The weird bit that throws me is the circular piece of bacon. It seems too thin to be classified as Canadian bacon, so … what is it? Does bacon come in circular slices? Have I led such a sheltered life that I was unaware of its existence? What else didn’t I know?
While grappling with these questions, I put some ketchup and mustard on it.
The first bite is … shockingly good. The second bite is just as good.
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
By the third bite, I realized I had come across a pretty decent cheeseburger. The patty is thick and lightly charred, as though it was truly, honestly grilled. The cheese is classic American, and the bun is similarly simple. The condiment addition is necessary to add some acidic bite, but overall, it’s a very tasty burger.
Lastly, the warm churro, nearly as long as my forearm.
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
What can one say? A churro is a churro is a churro. They’ll always be delicious. The hard, crunchy twisted exterior, dusted in sugar and cinnamon, gives way to a soft, fluffy, eggy inside. It’s hard to mess up churros.
So, what’s the verdict?
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
Sam’s Club’s food offerings are, on first glance, nearly identical to Costco’s. And there are a lot of parallels, certainly: both are unsung, rough-around-the-edges food stands serving, more or less, basic American fare. Very basic.
And yet … Sam’s Club’s quality and selection just can’t hold a candle to Costco’s.
source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
Costco’s menu is larger, and a bit more … well, fun. Brisket and chicken bakes and hot provolone sandwiches, galore! And its quality was shocking. Sam’s Club’s just seems on par for the course.",www.businessinsider.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,110,233073

England booted Colombia out of the 2018 World Cup – and Diego Maradona is furious.
Maradona had been supporting Argentina but switched allegiances when his country was dumped out of the tournament.
Colombia has also been eliminated but Maradona has accused England of match “theft” and has claimed the referee knows nothing about football.
Maradona has a long-standing rivalry with England, largely because of his “hand of God” goal in the 1986 World Cup, where he punched the ball into the net.
Read all of Business Insider’s World Cup coverage here.
England kicked Colombia out of the 2018 World Cup after a dramatic penalty shootout – and Diego Maradona, who was supporting Colombia – is outraged.
Maradona, 1986 World Cup champion, had been a prominent spectator during Argentina matches but seemingly switched allegiances when his country was dumped out of the competition by France.
His pick of Colombia only caused more World Cup disappointment for him as, despite the team’s “s—house tactics,” England prevailed right at the end of the match.
Maradona has argued that it is actually the English that was guilty of such tactics and even accused the Three Lions of “theft.”
He told Argentine TV, as per The Mirror: “I saw a monumental theft. I apologise to all the Colombian people, but they must know the players are not to blame.”
With the game precariously-tied at 1-1, the match went into extra-time and then penalties. England’s one goal in normal time arrived via a penalty kick won by captain and key striker Harry Kane, who held his nerve to convert from the spot.
But Maradona does not believe Kane deserved the penalty. “The penalty was not a foul. In fact, it was Kane’s fault. The referee is looking somewhere else and when he turns his head, Kane is on the floor. Kane used his arm to hook [Carlos] Sanchez and then threw himself down.”
caption Harry Kane earned a penalty against Colombia on Tuesday, after he was felled in the box. source Getty Images
Maradona has long-standing rivalry with England after his “hand of God” goal helped usher the Three Lions out of the 1986 World Cup.
He may have now renewed that rivalry by claiming the referee for Tuesday’s showdown should not have been “in charge of a game of that magnitude” as he “has no idea about football.”
He added: “Colombia died standing. That’s why I applaud them.”
Maradona has created a stream of headlines during his stay in Russia because of his apparently eccentric behaviour in a VIP box where he seemingly binged white wine, fell asleep at halftime, swore at Nigeria fans, required medical attention, and then flew off in a private jet.
The incident generated a lot of fake news, with some reports claiming Maradona had been hospitalised. The 57-year-old’s lawyer recently put a $10,000 bounty out to find the journalists responsible for spreading the fake news about his death but the search, so far, has failed to yield success.",www.businessinsider.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,22,233077

Google published a blog explaining the terms on which hundreds of app makers are given access to millions of inboxes belonging to Gmail users.
The company was also at pains to point out that “no one at Google reads your Gmail.”
But there are a couple of key exceptions to this rule, including when Google needs to go investigate a bug or “abuse” of the platform.
It’s not clear whether Gmail users are notified when Google rummages through messages to address these issues.
Google was hauled over the coals this week for reportedly giving hundreds of app makers access to millions of inboxes belonging to Gmail users.
The Wall Street Journal reported that users who signed up for “email-based services” like “shopping price comparisons,” and “automated travel-itinerary planners” were most at risk of having their private messages read.
In response to the story, Google published a blog on Tuesday detailing how third-party developers have to go through an involved review process before they are given access to Gmail.
Suzanne Frey, Google Cloud’s director of security, trust, and privacy, also said that Gmail’s 1.4 billion users hold the keys to their own data and can control permissions.
In the same piece, Frey was at pains to point out that Google itself does not read user emails.
Gmail automatically processes emails to filter out spam and phishing messages, which Frey said had “caused some to speculate mistakenly that Google ‘reads’ your emails.”
“To be absolutely clear: No one at Google reads your Gmail,” she added, before immediately listing the times Google does allow itself to have a peek at your inbox.
Frey said it is limited to “very specific cases.” These include when users give Google permission to access their messages, and when the company needs to investigate a security issue, such as a bug or “abuse.”
She did not offer more detail than this, however, meaning it’s not clear whether Google has the power to probe Gmail problems without notifying a user. Business Insider contacted Google for comment.
Frey concluded: “The work of privacy and security is never done, and we’re always looking for ways to better protect our users.”",www.businessinsider.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,13,233076

US President Donald Trump tweeted about his writing prowess on Tuesday.
But Trump made an unwitting error in his boast, using the word “pour” instead of “pore.”
The mistake was seized upon by “Harry Potter” author JK Rowling and others, including dictionary Merriam-Webster.
Trump deleted his original tweet, replacing it with one containing the correct use of the word “pour.”
JK Rowling is laughing at US President Donald Trump on Twitter after he misspelt a word in a tweet boasting about his writing prowess.
Trump said: “After having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pour over my tweets looking for a mistake. I capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized!”
He used the phrase “pour over,” when the grammatically correct version would have been “pore over.” The president swiftly deleted the tweet and reposted it with the correct use of the word pore.
“Harry Potter” author Rowling, a vehement critic of Trump, could not resist the urge to point and laugh at the mistake in a series of tweets before and after the president’s correction.

While many fans praised Rowling’s reaction, some were critical. Rowling replied to one person who said they would throw away their “Harry Potter” books on Twitter, claiming that reading the books would make her political leanings obvious.
Sweetheart, if you read the whole of Harry Potter and thought the author would support an authoritarian braggart who's too dumb to know how dumb he is, burn away. And so will I. pic.twitter.com/6U9PNqx0rK — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) July 3, 2018
The official account for dictionary Merriam-Webster also made light of Trump’s error on Twitter. It provided definitions for “pore over” and “pour over,” and went one step further, defining “comb over” – a not so subtle reference to the president’s signature hairstyle.

Fast-casual restaurants serving Middle Eastern food and Mediterrean food are suddenly everywhere.
Although Mediterranean food and Middle Eastern food are different, they have a lot of overlapping flavors.
Cava and Roti are just a few of the chains that have been rapidly growing across the United States.
Whole Foods predicted that Middle Eastern cuisine would be one of the top culinary trends in 2018 because of a growing demand for fresh, healthy, and flavorful food.
Middle Eastern and Mediterranean restaurants seem to be popping up on every corner.
Taïm, Cava, Hummus & Pita Co., and Roti are among the fast-growing restaurants that have been serving fresh Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food in a fast-casual style, with more and more national chains and local businesses hopping on the trend all the time.
Middle Eastern cuisine has been rising in popularity in recent years, and Whole Foods predicted it would be one of the top food trends of 2018. According to Whole Foods, hummus, pita, and falafel are “entry points” into Middle Eastern food, and spices like harissa, cardamom, and za’atar will likely start popping up on menus more and more.
Though Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food are distinct from one another, “Mediterranean” is often used as an umbrella term to describe both. For example, flatbreads, roasted meat, and hummus are generally considered stables of both types of cuisine.
Leila Hudson, associate professor of modern Middle East culture and political economy at the University of Arizona in Tucson, explained to QSR magazine, “Mediterranean is a much more popular selling point. People generally understand what that means.”
Tamim Shoja, who owns SKWR Kabobline in Washington, DC, told QSR: “We did a lot of research, and what kept sticking out was how many restaurants represented themselves as Mediterranean when they were not. I came to the realization it was a marketing thing. Mediterranean is something that is approachable.”
See how Middle Eastern food is taking over:

To aid in its expansion, the founders of Taïm have partnered with an investment group spearheaded by Chipotle vets Phil Petrilli and Bethany Strong. On the menu are a variety of falafel dishes that you can order on a pita or platter. It also has salads, fries, sides, and smoothies, all generally priced around $8 to $12.

At Taïm, one of the main sources of protein is chickpeas, the main ingredient in hummus and a staple in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food. The use of these proteins may help contribute to these fast-casual chains’ popularity because they can appeal to a growing number of consumers looking for plant-based options instead of meat.

Cava has more than 60 locations across the US, with even more locations opening soon.

Though Taïm is Israeli and Cava is Greek, the menus are pretty similar, with lots of falafel options, fresh vegetables, pitas, and dips made with spices like harissa and red pepper. The prices are also similar — at Cava, a pita costs $8.95, while a salad or bowl is $9.87.

The 36-year-old is the reigning Wimbledon champion and served up a near-perfect performance against second-round victim Lukáš Lacko on Wednesday.
At one point, Federer had won 35 consecutive points on his serve.
Federer admitted he played “very well” and is “looking forward” to the next round.
Roger Federer just dominated another opponent at the 2018 Wimbledon Championships.
Lukáš Lacko was the victim at Centre Court on Tuesday, falling in three consecutive sets (6-4, 6-4, 6-1) as Federer breezed through him with an utterly imperious serve.
At one point, Federer had won 35 consecutive points on his serve as Lacko simply struggled to contend with the reigning and defending Wimbledon champion.
Federer made 48 winners against 11 unforced errors and cleaned up in the second set, as he did not drop a single point on his serve. In total, he lost just nine of 61 points on his serve and broke Lacko five times, including a dominant forehand winner to claim the match win.
Commenting after the victory, Federer admitted to the BBC that he “played very well.”
He said he “felt good” and “less nervous” than he did in his previous match, his first-round win over Dušan Lajović on Monday. Federer added: “I’m happy with how I’m hitting the ball.”
On the dominant nature of his win, he said: “I think you only play as well as your opponent allows. I may have to adjust my game in the third round, for a completely different player.”
It is not yet known who Federer will face but he said he is “looking forward” to the next stage in the competition.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn under mounting pressure to back a second Brexit referendum
Leading Labour MEP tells Corbyn to “come over the hill” and back a soft Brexit.
Labour’s biggest union backer opens the door to a second vote.
Corbyn’s party remains commited to implementing Brexit.
BRUSSELS & LONDON – Jeremy Corbyn is under growing pressure to back a second Brexit referendum as figures from across the movement called on him to think again.
On Tuesday Labour’s biggest union backers Unite, passed a conference motion leaving the door open for a second Brexit referendum.
The chair of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, Theresa Griffin MEP, joined the calls for a rethink, telling Business Insider that Corbyn must “come over the hill” and embrace a softer Brexit policy, including a referendum on the final deal.
Griffin, the Labour MEP for northwest England, is the latest figure to join a growing chorus of voices within the Labour Party which is calling on the Westminster leadership to offer the British public the chance to reverse Brexit.
At least 2,600 members of Momentum, the pro-Corbyn group, have signed a petition calling for a second referendum, with 4,000 needed to trigger a poll of all members. Labour MPs from London, Wales and the northeast have publicly called on Corbyn to back another referendum in recent weeks – or what they describe as a “people’s vote.”
Last week, 62 local Labour parties and figures including an advisor to Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell declared their support for the Labour For A People’s Vote campaign. On Tuesday, Unite the union said it was “open to the possibility of a popular vote being held on any [Brexit] deal, depending on political circumstances.”
Griffin told BI that after months of personal deliberation over whether to support another referendum, she now believes the British public should be given another say on EU membership.
“We [Labour] are in a difficult position but we’ve got to come over the hill to say actually, when people voted in the referendum, they didn’t realise the implications of all of this,” the MEP told BI.
“The problem we’ve got is that until it [Brexit] actually happens, we won’t see just how bad this is going to get. I have lost thousands of jobs in the northwest since the beginning of December – and it hasn’t even started yet.”
She added: “I’ve come around to the idea that the referendum gave consent to the UK Government to begin the process of negotiating a deal to leave the EU. But as we didn’t know at the time what that deal would be, it is now necessary to ask the people if they agree with the terms of the deal once we know the impact.”
Griffin, who has been an MEP since 2014, added that it would be an “enormous mistake” for the Westminster Labour Party to not make staying in the single market part of its Brexit policy.
“My job is to mitigate Brexit and save as many jobs as I can in my region. To save as much regulation as I can in my region. To save the economies of my region. It makes no sense for my region to leave the single market,” she said.
A vast majority of Labour Party members want to stay in the single market but the Westminster leadership is wary of how Labour voters and constituencies which voted Leave would react to this policy.
Griffin told BI she understands the importance of “timing” but said the only way Labour can expect Leave voters to embrace a softer Brexit position is by first making the argument for it.
“I was addressing a meeting of shop stewards in the automatic industry prior to the referendum and they were saying they were voting leave and I said ‘hang on a minute, your jobs depend on the single market’.
“That opinion is shifting, but only because we are talking with them. We cannot leave anyone behind,” she said.
source Theresa Griffin MEP
Speaking to BI in Brussels, Griffin warned that Brexit poses a “disaster” to jobs and businesses nationwide, but stressed that few regions will take a bigger hit than northwest England, which she represents.
Both the IPPR and the University of Birmingham have said that leaving the EU will have a much bigger negative economic impact on the northwest than London. The IPPR predicted that 16.3% of Cumbria’s GDP and 15% of Lancashire’s are under threat. The UK government’s own impact assessments found that the Theresa May’s Brexit policy – a free trade agreement with the EU – could hit northwest GDP by 8%.
The Labour MEP said that Siemens, Volkswagon and Jaguar Land Rover have all warned that they could scale back production in their northwest bases if frictionless trade with the EU doesn’t continue after Brexit.
“This is generational. It will several generations to make up,” she said. “In the northwest, we have a lot of advanced manufacturing jobs which are in ‘just in time’ production. If we’re not part of the single market and customs union, we are facing both costly time delays and tariffs. For every job that goes, you’re talking about a family.”
If you ask their view of the UK negotiating team, they’d say we are a laughing stock.
She referenced northwest universities, like UCLAN in Preston, which are still unsure whether they’ll be able to receive EU grants from which they have been net gainers after the UK has left the bloc. “I’ve got 13 [universities in the north-west. They impact hugely on their local economies,” she said.
Griffin said she expects “reality will soon dawn” on Prime Minister May and force her to keep the UK closely aligned to the EU. “Given the glacial pace and incredible ineptitude of the UK’s Tory negotiating team, it seems likely that it will cave on at least some of their red lines in order to secure tariff-free access to the single market,” she said.
The Cabinet will meet on Friday to thrash out the details of the government’s highly-anticipated Brexit white paper, amid intense speculation that May is considering keeping the UK wedded to aspects of the single market.
However, even if the UK does end up with a soft version of Brexit, Griffin said she fears serious damage has already been done to UK-EU relations as a result of the Conservative government’s handling of the process.
“If you asked other MEPs from different countries whether they’d have the UK back tomorrow, the answer is yes.
“If you ask their view of the UK negotiating team, they’d say we are a laughing stock.”
She added: “Every time Boris Johnson opens his mouth and says something about business, everybody here reads the British press. Most people here speak English. When he is insulting about the negotiators, it gets picked up. We are losing credibility, hugely. I’m really worried that from a starting point of lots of goodwill, we have lost it.”",www.businessinsider.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,47,233039

UK-based venture capital firm Draper Esprit has entered Germany by investing in a local investor, Earlybird Venture Capital.
Draper will become a 50% backer of Earlybird’s sixth fund.
The deal gives Draper holdings in some of Earlybird’s portfolio companies, including cryptocurrency startup ShapeShift.
Draper chief executive Simon Cook said European venture capital is going through a Silicon Valley-style growth spurt.
Draper Esprit, the listed backer of fintech startups Revolut and TransferWise, has entered Germany by investing in local player Earlybird Venture Capital.
Draper has committed €18 million ($21 million/£16 million) to Earlybird’s sixth fund, and promised another €68 million (£60 million) over the next four years. Earlybird’s fund is £154 million at first close, and the partnership will make Draper a 50% backer. Draper has also issued a small number of shares to Earlybird.
Earlybird has offices in Berlin, Munich, and Istanbul.
Earlybird cofounder Hendrik Brandis said: “Earlybird has significant backing from mostly institutional private investors, and Draper Esprit has managed to very successfully access public capital markets, funds which we can co‐invest alongside. We believe this creates a very strong partnership.”
It’s an unusual move for an unusual venture capital firm.
One big advantage for Draper is that it becomes a shareholder in the 13 portfolio startups Earlybird has already invested in with its sixth fund.
Draper chief executive Simon Cook pointed specifically to cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift, headed up by early bitcoin evangelist and entrepreneur Erik Voorhees. ShapeShift becomes Draper’s second crypto holding after its investment in French crypto wallet startup Ledger, at a time when European venture capital firms are increasingly trying experimenting in crypto startups.
The deal also means Draper gets exposure to interesting German startups without having to open an office there. Earlybird and Draper will share deal flow and begin operating as a combined group, Cook said.
“We had a buy-build decision [of], do we open offices in Europe,” he told Business Insider. “We’ve known the Earlybird team for years… they have built a strong platform in Germany… they were also similarly starting to look to invest outside their home market.”
Draper may become the 100% backer for Earlybird’s next fund but that’s several years away, Cook added.
With the Earlybird partnership, Draper now has €1.3 billion at its disposal. The wider ambition, said Cook, is to become a household name in European investment, just as venture capital firms such as Sequoia are in the US.
“Our entire strategy is that Europe is going through the same spurt that Silicon Valley went through in the 1990s, when [VC firms] Sequoia and DFJ raised funds of about $150 million then… scaled up and got to a billion-plus and continued to be household names,” he said. “The top 20 [US] funds get 50% of the capital. We believe Europe is going through the same thing, it’s all about those firms that can scale up to be a billion-plus.”
That might mean further regional partnerships down the line, though Cook said there were no immediate plans. Draper already acquired seed investor Seedcamp’s first two funds and backed early-stage UK investor Episode 1.
“We’ve always been an acquisitive group,” said Cook. “We bought Seedcamp, now there’s Earlybird, and we entered France by ourselves. Our ambition is to build the biggest venture capital fund in Europe and be operational across all regions. We will always look at different opportunities. We’re a very creative group.”",www.businessinsider.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,30,233056

As the US celebrates Independence Day, you might feel the urge to watch a movie when you’re not outside barbecuing.
But which movie is the best to watch?
Business Insider has picked the best movies to watch on 12 major US holidays, from the 4th of July to New Year’s Day and Christmas.
The movies include recent Oscar darling “Lady Bird,” war epic “Saving Private Ryan,” and the cult-classic “Office Space.”
So when these holidays come around, keep these great movies in mind.
Below 12 of the best movies to watch on major US holidays:
New Year’s Eve/Day: “When Harry Met Sally” (1989)
source Columbia Pictures
This classic romantic comedy closes with a satisfying, heavily quoted New Year’s Eve party, so if you want to end/start your year off right, “When Harry Met Sally” is the perfect film to do so.
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day: “Selma” (2014)
source Paramount Pictures
Ava DuVernay’s “Selma” may have been snubbed from some major Oscar categories in 2015, as it missed out on a director nod for DuVernay and acting for David Oyelowo, but it’s still the definitive film about MLK, Jr.
Valentine’s Day: “Casablanca” (1942)
source Warner Bros.
There’s a plethora of romantic films to choose from that would be perfect on Valentine’s Day, so why not go with the original, and arguably best?
Presidents’ Day: “Lincoln” (2012)
source 20th Century Fox
Is it safe to say that the Steven Spielberg-directed “Lincoln” is the best movie about a president ever made? Probably. Plus, it’s always a good thing to revisit a Daniel Day-Lewis performance. He won his third Oscar for the role, and it could be his last, as he’s said that he’s retiring from acting.
Mother’s Day: “Lady Bird” (2017)
source A24
One of the best, and most relatable, mother-daughter movies ever made, “Lady Bird” features career-best performances from Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf, and proved Greta Gerwig isn’t to be messed with as an emerging, talented filmmaker.
Memorial Day: “Saving Private Ryan” (1998)
source Paramount Pictures
Spielberg’s “Saving Private Ryan” is one of the greatest war movies ever made, and embodies the sacrifice soldiers make to serve their country.
Father’s Day: “The Lion King” (1994)
source Walt Disney Studios
At its core, “The Lion King” is a story about a son’s relationship with his father, and what it means to step out of his shadow to be his own man. It’s a story that many can relate to, even if the characters are lions.
4th of July: “Independence Day” (1996)
source 20th Century Fox
Sometimes the obvious choice is the best choice. Roland Emmerich’s sci-fi blockbuster about an alien invasion remains a fun and entertaining watch, despite a lackluster recent sequel.
Labor Day: “Office Space” (1999)
source Paramount
There’s no better movie to watch on Labor Day, a holiday that celebrates workers, than “Office Space,” a cult-classic satire on mundane office work and the employees who can’t stand it any longer.
Halloween: “Halloween” (1978)
source Columbia Pictures
Remember when I said that sometimes the obvious choice is the best choice? It’s still true. A direct sequel is coming later this year, so maybe a terrifying double-feature will even be in order.
Thanksgiving: “Scent of a Woman” (1992)
source Universal
It’s slim pickings when it comes to movies that have any relation to Thanksgiving. But “Scent of a Woman,” which got Al Pacino his only Oscar win for his role as a blind retired Army Lt. Colonel, takes place on a Thanksgiving weekend, and features an awkward but dramatic holiday dinner scene that is a standout in the film.
Christmas: “Batman Returns” (1992)
source Warner Bros.
Since there are so many great Christmas movies, it’s hard to choose just one. Rather than opting for the traditional choices like “A Christmas Story” or “It’s a Wonderful Life” or “Elf” that people would most likely watch anyway, I present a dark horse alternative. If “Die Hard” can be a Christmas movie, then so can “Batman Returns.”",www.businessinsider.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,27,233091

The Embr Wave is a “personal thermostat” – a wearable you strap onto your wrist to help you feel more comfortable indoors.
Embr Labs says after three minutes of using the device, you can feel up to five degrees warmer or cooler.
I tried the Embr Wave for a few days, and found that it helped me feel more comfortable when I was overheated, or shivering in a frigid office.
Working in an office these days is an exercise in personal temperature control.
One minute, you’re sweating it out after your commute on public transit, or even just the walk into your office. The next minute, you’re shivering in the arctic temperatures dictated by the thermostat.
That struggle is what inspired the team at Embr Labs to create the Embr Wave, a “personal thermostat” you wear on your wrist.
The Embr Wave works by heating or cooling on its own, depending on your needs. The idea is that, with the press of a button, you can feel more comfortable in your environment – in fact, Embr Labs says after three minutes of using the device, you can feel up to five degrees warmer or cooler.
“Temperature is as much subjective as it is objective,” Sam Shames, CEO of Embr Labs, told Business Insider. “Heating a building is like setting the temperature of a shower for hundreds of people.”
It all comes down to skin temperature. When you’re feeling cold, your core body temperature doesn’t actually change, but your skin temperature does, Shames said. Putting something warm against your skin will provide some relief and make you feel more comfortable in your environment.
Sweatshirts in the summer
The idea behind the Embr Wave originated in a lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2013. Shames – along with his cofounders, Matthew Smith and David Cohen-Tanugi – were so cold while working in the lab, they were bundled up in sweatshirts in the middle of the summer.
source Embr Labs
They came up with the idea for Embr Wave and submitted to the Intel Make it Wearable competition that October. From there, their story blew up.
“We started getting emails from people all over the world who said that temperature was the biggest problem in their lives,” Shames said.
By 2017, Embr Labs had launched a successful Kickstarter campaign, raising $630,000 – more than six times its $100,000 goal. The company also attracted investors like Intel and Bose.
The Embr Wave officially went on sale in March, and it doesn’t come cheap – it costs a whopping $300, nearly as much as an Apple Watch Series 3.
Aiding the ‘thermally underserved’
The Embr Wave is intended for a group of people Shames refers to as the “thermally underserved population” – people who are frequently uncomfortable in their indoor surroundings, either because it’s too hot or too cold.
I happen to be part of that population – I’m almost always way too hot – so I tried out the Embr Wave for a few days to see if it made a difference.
One of the best features of the Embr Wave is that the temperature sensation comes in waves. When you first put it on, just press the thin light bar on the front of the device, then press and hold on either the left or right side of the button – left for cold, warm for hot.
From there, you’ll feel a warming or cooling sensation intermittently for either five minutes or three minutes respectively. If you’re not satisfied by the end of a session, just knock on the front of the device and it will restart. The only downside of that design is that if you accidentally set the temperature too hot or too cold, you have to wait for it to be done and try again.
While the device is heating or cooling, you’ll see the light bar glow in waves. Here’s the Embr Wave in action:
Shames recommends that you take the Embr Wave on and off as you need it. You don’t have to wear it like a standard wearable – instead, just strap it on when you feel uncomfortable.
This is a good thing, too, because the device is decidedly … huge. It’s nice looking, thanks to its metal mesh band and almost complete lack of buttons, but it certainly isn’t subtle. In fact, I often felt like I was wearing a house arrest monitor on my wrist.
Looks don’t really matter, though, because the Embr Wave actually works. I tested it everywhere I could – at my apartment, on the subway, in the office, while walking from the subway to the office, etc. – and truly felt a difference in how comfortable I was.
The Embr Wave certainly isn’t a cure-all. In one situation where I was actively sweating on a too-hot subway car, it could only help me so much. But most of the time, it provided me with a pleasant cooling sensation that saved me from feeling warm and irritable. Of course, the same feeling could probably be achieved by running your wrists under cold water, but the Embr Wave can be hidden under a shirt sleeve and worn while you continue to work or sit in a meeting.
So, do you really need a $300 wearable with only one function? Probably not. But if you’re among the thermally underserved, you might want one.",www.businessinsider.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,44,232948

The fireworks you enjoy every 4th of July are the result of a chain of chemical reactions.
When a firework container is lit, its contents of colored explosives called “stars” light up the sky.
The colors that sparkle in the sky are chemical reactions happening right before your eyes.
The spectacle of a fireworks display may leave you wondering what it took to get that color-changing, dazzling sequence into the sky.
We’re here to help.
Fireworks are the result of a whole bunch of chemical reactions. And it all leads to an explosion.
Simply, a firework is a container – typically a tube or ball shape – that holds explosives hitched up to a time-delay fuse.
There are two explosive parts in a firework – the one that shoots it into the sky, and a set of little balls of explosives called “stars.” These stars are filled with colors that blaze brightly in the sky, but after only a certain amount of time has passed. This is why fireworks can get up high in the sky before exploding into brilliance.
When the fuse gets low enough in the firework, it reacts with a bursting charge, which in turn lights the explosive that will disperse the stars. The ignited explosive creates a high-pressure gas that blows the colorful stars outward. Afterward, the cardboard that enclosed the explosives rains to the ground as charred remains.
Here’s what that looks like:
Chemical reactions create the colors
The colors that sparkle in the sky are chemical reactions happening right before your eyes.
Inside every star is an oxidizing agent, fuel, a metal that acts as the color, and a binder that holds it all together. The fuel and oxidizing agent are the parts responsible for the intense heat and gas of the explosion, according to the American Chemical Society.
But the coolest part is the metals that act as the colors. The heat makes the atoms inside the wire move faster and faster, causing the atoms to bump into each other more, which gives off light. If you can control the temperature of the firework, then you can pick the exact time you want that firework to be a certain color.
Some fireworks heat up and cycle through red, orange, yellow, and white, depending on how hot the explosion is. But more commonly, fireworks create light by letting off specific colors that depend on which metals are in the mix.
For a complete display, fireworks often mix different metals and metal salts for vibrant, multicolored effects. Calcium salts will burn orange, while sodium salts will burn yellow. If you burn copper, it’ll give off light that’s blue-green.
The science behind fireworks’ shapes and sounds
Fascinated by that smiley face or oddly lopsided heart in a firework display? It’s nothing more than some careful organization of the stars. If they’re just spread randomly, they’ll expand out evenly through the sky once they explode.
But, because the explosion will push the stars out in a predictable trajectory, it is possible to organize the stars in a pattern on the cardboard cylinder on the outside of the firework. This will create specific shapes.
And of course, no fireworks display would be complete without the ear-shattering booms that freak out dogs and resonate in our chests. Those noises are caused by a sonic boom that happens as the gases inside the firework expand faster than the speed of sound.
In the end you get one bright, loud, beautiful way to celebrate the Fourth of July.

July Fourth is a time for celebration.
Americans are the luckiest, most privileged people on the planet.
This July Fourth, in the midst of all the plans for barbecues and baseball games, flags and fireworks, there’s a darker, more pessimistic sense of defeatism lurking. Americans are asking themselves: In the wake of our immigration crisis, at a time when our government sometimes acts in a decidedly un-American fashion, is there anything to celebrate this year?
The answer, of course, is yes.
No country is perfect. There are always going to be periods that are better and worse for the governed and the governing. Periods in which the actions of a country deeply reflect a commitment to its foundational core values, and periods in which those actions directly contradict those core values. But the genius of the founders was creating a system of checks and balances. No system is perfect, and there is always room for abuse to fester. But our system is one that makes those abuses of power that much more difficult.
This country, even in our weakest moments, is a blessing. Our laws, our freedoms, our equality – these are only some of the reasons we have refugees, immigrants, and asylum-seekers thronging at our borders. When talking about all the people who want to come here, and how we should be treating them, we should remember why are trying to come here, to this country, to join this nation.
Throughout the decades, American presidents have used July Fourth as a time to address the nation, reminding us of our responsibilities and of our privileges.
In 1993, Bill Clinton challenged the country to keep changing, improving, always striving for better:
“When Abraham Lincoln wrote the Emancipation Proclamation, he gave our Nation’s bloodiest conflict a sacred, moral purpose, to turn the promises of the Declaration and the Constitution and the Bill of Rights into living realities for all our people. “It is a struggle we are still waging. Still, we struggle to live in a way that will please a just God. Still, we struggle to live in a way that we can secure for every American, without regard to race or region or station in life, the blessing of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Still, we struggle to find ways to extend a helping hand of freedom to people throughout the world. No less than those who founded our Republic or fought to keep it together in the Civil War, we too, must have the vision and courage to change, to preserve our unchanging purposes in a dynamic and difficult word.”
In 1962, JFK reminded the nation about its exceptional history – and future: “For 186 years this doctrine of national independence has shaken the globe – and it remains the most powerful force anywhere in the world today.”
In 2001, George W. Bush highlighted the radical nature of the American project:
“A wonderful country was born and a revolutionary idea sent forth to all mankind: Freedom, not by the good graces of government but as the birthright of every individual; equality, not as a theory of philosophers but by the design of our Creator; natural rights, not for the few, not even for a fortunate many but for all people, in all places, in all times.”
These are the words we should spend the day thinking about. Our nation was built with a system of government that is endowed with the power to withstand far worse than the Trump presidency. Put the hysterics aside, grab a hot dog, watch the fireworks with friends and family, and express gratitude at being a citizen of this great country, the land of the free and the home of the brave.",www.businessinsider.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,23,233105

Venezuela is suffering from a rapidly deteriorating economy and weakening law and order.
US President Donald Trump reportedly wanted to address the crisis by mounting a US invasion and deposing President Nicolas Maduro.
Sources say his aides told him that an invasion was a terrible idea, but Trump persisted, and even floated the plan with neighboring countries.
Trump’s bullish rhetoric is likely going to bolster Maduro’s standing at home.
Donald Trump reportedly asked senior administration officials and world leaders if the US could invade Venezuela to bring stability to the country’s political crisis.
The US president first asked aides whether the US could just take over the country on August 10, 2017, at an Oval Office meeting to discuss US sanctions on the country, according to the Associated Press.
The backdrop was the South American nation’s rapidly deteriorating economy, and the perilous state of law and order there.
The previously undisclosed meeting, on which the White House has declined to comment, was anonymously revealed by a senior administration official speaking to AP.
Trump’s suggestion reportedly stunned people at the meeting, including Rex Tillerson and HR McMaster, then Secretary of State and National Security Advisor respectively.
The AP said they then spent five minutes taking turns to warn Trump how military action could backfire and lose him support among other Latin American governments.

Despite his aides’ warnings, Trump reportedly continued to talk of a “military option” to remove Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s president.
A month later, Trump proceeded to ask the leaders of four Latin American countries, at a private dinner held at a UN General Assembly in New York, whether they would accept military action. One of them was Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, while the identities of the other leaders are not known.
Trump reportedly prefaced the conversation with the leaders with the phrase: “My staff told me not to say this.”
He then went around the table to ask each leader whether they were certain they didn’t want the US to invade Venezuela, to which each leader said clearly that they were, the AP reported.
Venezuela’s inflation rose above the 41,000% mark last month, and the UN human rights office declared a breakdown of law and order in the country, citing reports that security forces had killed hundreds of anti-government demonstrators while protecting alleged criminals from prosecution.
Venezuelans have also been fleeing to countries including Brazil, Colombia, Chile, the US, and Spain.
source Skye Gould/Business Insider
Trump said last August that a military option was not out of the question for dealing with the Venezuelan crisis, but details of the president’s seriousness about the issue had not been reported until Wednesday.
His administration also levied new sanctions on dozens of Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, in May.
Trump’s bullish stance against Venezuela is likely to bolster Maduro’s standing at home, as his supporters have long lamented Washington’s involvement in domestic affairs, and used anti-US sentiment to unite against his opponents.
Maduro’s son, also named Nicolas, said last year: “Mind your own business and solve your own problems, Mr Trump!”",www.businessinsider.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,20,233117

Donald Trump’s proposed trade war could cost the global economy $800 billion, or 4% of global trade.
“The threat to world growth is significant,” Oxford lead economist Adam Slater wrote in a recent note to clients.
It comes at the same time central banks are raising interest rates and the price of oil is going up.
LONDON – If US President Trump follows through on his threats to stage a trade war against his former allies in Europe, China, and other countries, it could reduce world trade by 4% and wipe away 0.4 percentage points of global GDP (about $800 billion), according to Oxford Economics.
A trade war would be especially bad for the global economy because it would come right as oil prices and interest rates are both rising globally. “The threat to world growth is significant,” Oxford lead economist Adam Slater wrote in a recent note to clients.
His warning is the latest in a string from researchers, investment banks, and politicians:
Slater’s research attempts to quantify just how much economic damage would occur across the planet if all Tump’s various threats come true. Summarised in one chart, it looks like this:
source Oxford Economics
“Recent tariff threats, if realised, would extend high tariffs to over 4% of world imports – a tenfold rise. This comes just as the global upturn shows signs of faltering. The threat to world growth is significant: in a scenario of escalating tariffs, our modelling suggests world GDP could be cut by up to 0.4 percentage points in 2019,” Slater wrote.
Currently imposed tariffs only total about $60 billion (or 0.3%) of world trade. But all the upcoming proposed and threatened tariffs bring the total to $800 billion (4%).
Between 2015 and 2017 world trade had been growing. But that trend reversed after Trump took office at the beginning of 2017:
source Oxford Economics
“The upsurge in protectionism comes at an inopportune time for the global economy. World trade growth appears to have slowed notably in recent months. Freight-based indicators are especially worrying, with six-month annualised growth having subsided from 6-7% in January to around zero in April. There are also broader indications of a slowdown. The Citigroup economic surprises indices for the G10 and emerging markets have turned deeply negative, with disappointing data releases dominating,” Slater told clients.
The US has some buffer room given that its economy is currently growing more quickly than the other major economic blocs. But that is threatened if a full-blown trade war arrives as central banks increase interest rates and oil prices go up, Slater believes.",www.businessinsider.sg,2018-07-05 00:00:00,20,232962
"source presentation on the state of the markets and the economy
Volatility has defined 2018’s stock market. Trade war fears, and an increasing belief the US is nearing the end of the economic cycle have both put a damper on investor sentiment.
The S&P 500 is only up slightly this year, and the Dow Jones is down, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq is leading the way in the US.
But as the yield curve flattens, and investors flock into long-term government debt for safety, the outlook for equities may not be as rosy as it was in at the start of the year.
The Federal Reserve is planning more rate hikes this year, but will certainly have to be vigilant if it’s going to go through with its plans.
Fortunately, JPMorgan has published its third-quarter presentation on the state of the markets and the economy.
Through almost 70 slides of charts and graphics, they provide insight into the state of equities and both the US and global economy.

"State-owned general insurer will have to fork out around Rs 2.5 billion in insurance claims to Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), following the crash of its Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jet near Nashik last week.
This will be the largest claim in the aviation sector for Indian insurers in the last three years, said sources.
The Su-30 aircraft was on a pre-delivery test flight when it crashed last Wednesday. There were no casualties. had insured the aircraft with for around Rs 2.5 billion. The policy covers manufacturer liability arising from accidents or incidents before it is handed over to the air force.

The Sukhoi loss last week will result in the largest aviation payout since Chennai floods of December 2015. Eight jets owned by corporate houses were damaged during the floods, resulting in claims of around Rs 5 billion. The actual payout is unknown but believed to have been around Rs 4 billion, making 2015 one of the worst years for aviation insurance in India.

"The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) may not withdraw the look out circular against K C Chakrabarty, former deputy governor at Reserve Bank of India, for some time as investigation in a forgery case continues.
The CBI had issued the LOC in connection with a 2016 forgery case filed by the Indian Overseas Bank against a Delhi-based travel company — Airworth Travels & Tours Pvt Limited, its promoters and ‘unnamed public servants’.
CBI sources said he has been questioned by the CBI in Indian Overseas Bank case. The probe is not complete yet and he is not allowed to leave India, the sources said.
Sources familiar with the developments said Chakrabarty wants to resolve the issue amicably.
The bank has accused them of “…cheating, forgery of valuable securities, forgery for the purpose of cheating, using forged documents as genuine…” and public servants of “abuse of official position”, thereby dishonestly causing a loss. A look out circular is used to monitor and prevent the entry or exit of persons who may be required by law enforcement authorities.
The FIR registered by the CBI in the case does not name Chakrabarty. He was scheduled to go to London from Mumbai airport on May 1.
He had requested withdrawal of the look out circular, so that he can travel to London, where he is now settled.
CBI sources said there have been instances in the past where people against whom look out circular has been issued went abroad and never returned. This has hampered the investigation.

"The National Democratic Alliance government’s decision to hike minimum support prices (MSPs) is likely to increase headline retail inflation by 50-90 basis points (bps), say economists. But in the absence of clarity over how much will be actually procured, the impact on the government’s finances is difficult to ascertain.
The headline (CPI) is expected to rise by around 70 bps, while wholesale inflation (WPI) is expected to rise by 38 bps, says Devendra Pant, chief economist at India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra).
Suvodeep Rakshit at Kotak Institutional Equities pegs the impact at 50-60 bps, assuming there is full pass-through, while A Prasanna at ICICI Securities expects to rise between 50-90 bps in 2018-19.

With having risen to 4.87 per cent in May 2018, up from 4.58 per cent in April, these estimates suggest it may well overshoot the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) inflation projections.
In its last monetary policy review, the RBI had projected to range between 4.8 and 4.9 per cent in the first half of 2018-19, slowing down to 4.7 per cent in the second half.
But, it had noted that “the impact of the revision in the MSP formula for kharif crops is not possible to assess at this stage in the absence of adequate details.”
ALSO READ: MSP hike could stoke inflation, prompt RBI to raise interest rates: Experts
“The announcement of higher MSPs itself would have an upward push to inflation since the monetary expectations of farmers for their harvest are now raised. We might see this upward climb of CPI inflation even before the harvest season kicks in,” says Himanshu, associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University.
Some economists believe that the rise in CPI could force the monetary policy committee to raise rates in its next meeting.
“The inflation trajectory in the near term would remain upwardly biased and hence at least one more rate hike by the regulator is likely, more so in October 2018, though a rate hike in August 2018 cannot be entirely ruled out,” noted Ind-Ra.
On the other hand, it is difficult to gauge the impact of the hike in MSP on government finances because of lack of clarity over what may end up being procured.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that the decision could cost the government roughly Rs 150 billion.
But according to government sources this estimate is based only on procurement of paddy and does not factor in procurement costs for other crops, which are likely to be around Rs 220-250 billion.
But in the absence of data on what the government plans to procure, it is difficult to know for sure.
“The actual costs will depend on the level of procurement. Barring rice and wheat, procurement of other crops is carried out only in a very few select areas, where the state government takes the initiative,” says Abhijeet Sen, former member of the Planning Commission.
A senior official of the Food Corporation of India told Business Standard that “the state governments can get central government assistance if the coarse grains they procure are distributed under the National Food Security Act.”
“Assuming the procurement of kharif crops would be as much as last year’s, the higher MSPs would cost the government about Rs 115 billion,” says D K Joshi, chief economist at CRISIL. “But the actual cost incurred could be substantially higher as procurement is set to increase. Where a crop is not procured, the government may have to make deficiency payments to farmers, which is the difference between the MSP and market/mandi price. Currently, market/mandi prices for most crops are below their announced MSPs,” he adds.
According to Shubhada Rao, group president and chief economist, YES Bank, “The fiscal impact of MSP recalibration is estimated at around Rs 150 billion to Rs 200 billion (0.1 per cent of gross domestic product), premised on government procurement growing by 1 per cent in 2018-19, on the back of expectations of normal monsoon.”
Rao does not see a risk to 2018-19 fiscal deficit target, as “it appears that the government has made adequate provisions in the Union Budget.”
However, others are not so sure.
“Without additional details on whether the procurement of crops would be widened from the current set, or if some other mechanism would be adopted to ensure that farmers receive prices on a with MSPs for their produce, it remains difficult to ascertain the impact of higher MSPs on inflation and the fiscal deficit,” says Aditi Nayar, principal economist at Icra.",www.business-standard.com,2018-07-05 00:00:00,22,273457

In line with the bank’s renewed focus on the retail segment, it has become the largest mortgage lender among private sector
“We plan to grow at 15 per cent and bring the mortgage book to Rs 2 trillion by the end of FY20,” said Anup Bagchi, executive director,
The mortgage portfolio forms 52 per cent of the bank’s retail loan book of approximately Rs 3 trillion, he added.
To achieve its Rs 2-trillion target, is expanding its network to new locations in tier-II and III cities as well as micro-markets on the periphery of major cities.
“We already have branches in those locations, so we are creating branches within branches,” said Bagchi.
The bank currently has 1,050 processing centres and plans to add 560 centres to its network.
Bagchi added that the strongest growth in mortgage loans was coming from tier-II, tier-III and tier-IV cities. The average ticket size stands at over Rs 3 million.
The bank said it has seen big traction from its customers for the ‘housing for all’ scheme. “In terms of affordable home loans, the number of loans given is higher. However, it is slow to contribute to the book,” said Bagchi. The bank claimed that delinquencies were “not a problem”.
ICICI Bank plans to leverage technology to offer home loans and expects digitisation of processes to result in lower operating expenses and lead to significant savings, which would be passed on to customers.

"A black Oregon state lawmaker was canvassing in her district when one of her constituents called the police.
Oregon State Rep. Janell Bynum, who is running for reelection this fall, was knocking on the doors of her constituents in Clackamas County — just southeast of Portland — on Tuesday when an officer arrived, she said in a post on Facebook that included a photo of her and the officer smiling together.
Bynum said she was “canvassing and keeping account of what (her) community cares about,” but was instead deemed as “suspicious” enough by one of her constituents for them to call the cops. In an interview with The Oregonian, Bynum said the officer told her a person called to report someone who was spending a long time outside of homes in the neighborhood.
She asked the officer to meet the person who reported her to the cops and spoke to her on the phone, when the constituent apologized.
“It was just bizarre,” Bynum told the newspaper. “It boils down to people not knowing their neighbors and people having a sense of fear in their neighborhoods, which is kind of my job to help eradicate. But at the end of the day, it’s important for people to feel like they can talk to each other to help minimize misunderstandings.”
Bynum’s experience is just the latest instance of people calling the police on black Americans and people of color for for doing everyday activities. There were the two men sitting in a Starbucks in Philadelphia, the Yale graduate student sleeping in her dorm’s study lounge, the two men having a cookout in Oakland and the women checking out of an Airbnb in California — all of whom had the cops called on them. The events have resulted in a number of responses, including a company-wide call to action at Starbucks to prevent racial bias and when hundreds turned out in Oakland for a picnic called “Barbecuing While Black.”
As for Bynum, she told the Oregonian the experience helped inform her role as a state lawmaker.
“We all know that we’re not in a society that is perfect, and we have wounds that still need to heal, but at the end of the day, I want to know my kids can walk down the street without fear,” she said.",time.com,2018-07-05 00:00:00,11,354308
"“The outlook for ratings is stable, reflecting our view that the risks to the creditworthiness of the banks are balanced”
The S&P credit rating agency announced the upgrading of the creditworthy four Greek banks – Alpha Bank, Eurobank, The Greek National Bank and Piraeus Bank – following the upgrading of the Greek government’s lender.
“On June 25, 2018, we upgraded Greece’s long-term foreign and domestic currency ratings to from B to B+ due to the reduction in debt servicing risks. We anticipate that the successful completion by Greece of the fourth ESM evaluation will help improve depositors and investors’ confidence in the banking system, “said the company, adding that:” For this reason, we are increasing our long-term and short-term credit assessments by Alpha Bank, Eurobank, National Bank and Piraeus Bank to “B-/ B” from “CCC +/C”.
Furthermore, the credit rating agency says that “the outlook for ratings is stable, reflecting our view that the risks to the creditworthiness of the banks are balanced”.
The upgrading, the company notes, “also reflects our view that improved liquidity and the growth of the economy will support the ability of Greek banks to maintain their financial commitments and to gradually improve their balance sheets over the long term”.
“We expect growth of confidence and the ease of capital controls will pave the way for a steadier inflow of deposits and improve banks’ access to capital markets. We estimate that some 13 billion or 9% of deposits have returned to Greek banks from mid May 2017 to the end of May 2018 and banks have restricted their dependence on the European Central Bank’s liquidity facilities by 63% or 36 billion euros.”

"Independence Day is here, and I’m sure several American gamers out there are taking advantage of the holiday to sit down and enjoy a round of digital entertainment in between the barbecued ribs and the backyard fireworks show (assuming my neighborhood is a microcosm of the US population).
As long as you’re there, American gamers, why not have a turn on one of these games, which showcase a different facet of patriotism and are also fun enough to keep your attention.
Broforce
If we’re going to do this, let’s start off strong — with a 2D run-and-gun game where you play muscle-bound bros gunning down those who threaten liberty and justice. Who cares if it’s an obvious parody created by a South African developer? It’s still hilarious and fun.
Oregon Trail
Let’s face it: for many of us, first-grade history was a long time ago. You may not recall who the 14th president was, but if you were allowed any free time in the computer lab in the 90s, you sure remember that dysentery was a common cause of death during the Westward expansion.
So if you want to take a crack at semi-historical depictions of America, what better way would there be than reliving this cheerfully joyless piece of gaming nostalgia. It’s currently available to play in-browser thanks to the Internet Archive.
Fallout 3
Two words: Liberty. Prime.
Bioshock Infinite
Okay, I’m cheating a little bit here. Bioshock Infinite‘s relationship with American jingoism is a little frosty, to say the least. But if all you’re looking for a first-person shooter where you play an 80s American action hero, I think Duke Nukem is still around here somewhere. I honestly wouldn’t judge you.
I recommend Bioshock Infinite more for its critical, if unsubtle depiction of idealized American life and the suffering caused by the need for an unattainable paradise. And as long as I’m recommending patriotic games, I don’t think I can leave out the one with a robotic George Washington that carries a massive Gatling gun.
Saints Row 4
I’m on record calling this series “nonstop madcap action that makes [Grand Theft Auto] look as sober as a John Steinbeck novel.” I offer as evidence of that the fact that your former gang leader Player Character becomes President of the United States by riding a nuclear payload right in the damned Oval Office.
Look, I don’t think I’m spoiling anything by telling you the opening of the game involves President Boss jumping into an anti-aircraft gun (which rises from the White House lawn) and personally shooting down attacking aliens that have abducted most of their staff. Having told you that, I think you’ll either be all-in on this game’s All-American premise, or you won’t be.
Honorable Mention: Metal Wolf Chaos
I put this as an honorable mention because it’s never been technically released in the West. That said, it’d be hard to mention patriotic games without bringing up that game where the main character is the President in a mech suit fighting the evil Veep — and even that description is hardly doing it justice.
Created by From Software — yes, the Dark Souls people — the game is finally being brought the land of the people who can most appreciate it sometime later this year. Devolver Digital revealed the remastered edition at this year’s E3, and I think I’ll let President Wilson do the talking for me:

Romania's parliament voted through controversial changes to the penal code on Wednesday, a move condemned by President Klaus Iohannis as ""dictatorship of the majority"".
In a fast-paced process rarely seen in the east-european country, the amendments cleared all the parliamentary procedures in less then a week and were passed by a margin of 168 to 97 in the lower chamber plenary.
The left-wing ruling coalition argues that the changes, which partially decriminalise abuse of office, are needed to stop ""abuses"" from part of the judiciary.
However the centre-right opposition, to which Iohannis belongs, has slammed the move as an attempt to overturn a prison sentence given to Liviu Dragnea, the powerful leader of the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD).
""What we've seen these days is called dictatorship of the majority and is profoundly harmful for democracy"", Iohannis said in a statement.
The European Commission voiced concern at the reforms and said it wouldn't hesitate to act if Romania's legislation does not conform with European and international norms.
Romania's public prosecutor Augustin Lazar also criticised the penal reforms, which he said had been ""made in conformity with the attitudes and vices of the defendants, not by EU standards"".
Romania is one of the EU's most graft-ridden countries and prosecutors have launched a crackdown on corrupt officials in recent years.
Anti-corruption investigators said more than 200 abuse of office cases could be scrapped under the new penal code.
Last week 12 Western nations issued a joint warning that the judicial reforms proposed by Romanian lawmakers could ""impede international law enforcement cooperation"".
Dragnea, widely seen as the most powerful politician in the country, was sentenced last month to three-and-a-half years in prison over a fake jobs scandal, a decision he has appealed.
He could not serve as prime minister because of a previous conviction, in 2016, for vote-rigging.
""Do you think they will let me get away? Let's be serious,"" Dragnea told reporters on Tuesday, when asked whether the law change could keep him out of jail.
Under the changes, abuse of office is no longer a crime if prosecutors can't prove that the defendant committed the deed for his own benefit or that of close relatives.
Also, an official who makes less then 1,900 lei (407 euro) as a result of a crime will not be prosecuted. Maximum jail time is also reduced from seven to five years for this offence.
President Iohannis and the opposition said they would challenge the bill in the constitutional court.
At the beginning of 2017, shortly after winning power, the PSD tried to push through legal reforms widely seen as aimed at helping Dragnea with his previous legal troubles.
However, that move sparked the biggest wave of protests since the fall of communism, forcing the government to back down.",www.pulse.ng,2018-07-04 23:59:00,20,240191

According to Reuters, Britain's counter-terrorism head Neil Basu said on Wednesday that there was no intelligence to indicate that both of the British citizens, aged in their 40s, had been deliberately targeted. However, he emphasized that police did not yet know how the nerve agent was transmitted.
""Following the detailed analysis of these samples, we can confirm that the man and woman have been exposed to the nerve agent Novichok, which has been identified as the same nerve agent that contaminated both Yulia and Sergei Skripal,"" Neil Basu said in a statement.

""We are not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to. The possibility that these two investigations might be linked is clearly a line of enquiry for us,"" he added.
Meanwhile, England's Chief Medical Officer Sally Davies told Reuters on Wednesday that the risk to the public remained low after a man and a woman became exposed to the nerve agent in Southern England.
""These two patients are in critical condition following exposure to the nerve agent Novichok,"" Sally Davies was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""As the country's chief medical officer, I want to reassure the public that the risk to the general public remains low.""
On Wednesday morning, the police of the UK county of Wiltshire said there had been ""a major incident"" in Amesbury involving the possible exposure of two people to an unknown substance, after a man and woman were found unconscious on Saturday and taken to Salisbury District Hospital in critical condition.
The Defense Science and Technology Laboratory in Porton Down told Sputnik on Wednesday that it was ""supporting"" the investigation into an incident involving two people found unconscious in the town of Amesbury, located close to the city of Salisbury, where former Russian Military Intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter were contaminated in March.
Meanwhile, Neil Basu Basu said a 45-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman had been initially thought to have fallen ill after using drugs from a potentially contaminated batch. But on Monday samples from both patients were sent for analysis to Porton Down laboratory, which also investigated the toxin used in the Skripal case.
The British anti-terror police chief emphasized the priority for the investigation team was to establish how these two people had come into contact with the nerve agent. He added any baseless assumptions should be avoided.",sputniknews.com,2018-07-04 23:59:00,15,128796

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's younger brother, former army chief Humberto Ortega, called Wednesday for early elections and the dismantling of violent pro-government paramilitary groups to help resolve months of unrest that has killed more than 200 people.
Ortega made public his proposals contained in a letter to a Catholic Church-mediated national dialogue between government and opposition, meeting in a bid to end anti-Ortega protests and government repression that have wracked the Central American country since April 18.
The retired general, who has often taken a critical view of his brother's administration, proposed bringing forward elections scheduled for 2021 to 2019 -- a key opposition demand which he said was ""a peaceful solution to the tragic crisis we are suffering.""
By holding early elections, the president would ""say yes to peace"" which will help the economy recover, as well as regenerate investment and tourism, said the younger brother.
He also urged the government to dismantle the paramilitary groups and called on the opposition to tear down barricades used to seal off parts of cities from the police, ""no matter how righteous your reasons may be.""
Foreign Minister Denis Moncada told the talks that the government is willing to listen to the opposition, but demanded that the barricades be lifted first.
The 72-year-old president has remained silent on an earlier proposal by the influential Catholic hierarchy to bring forward the elections to March next year.

"The government decision on Wednesday to significantly increase minimum support price (MSP) for several kharif crops to boost farmers’ incomes could push inflation upwards and widen the fiscal deficit , independent economists have said.The Reserve Bank of India could subsequently raise interest rates to counter the potential inflationary impact, some of them said.“On paper, the revisions are substantial. A lot would depend on a successful procurement exercise,” said Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank , which has revised its inflation estimate for FY19 to 5.3% from 5%. India Ratings expects kharif MSP to increase wholesale inflation by 38 basis points and retail Inflation by 70 basis points. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.“In conjunction with elevated oil prices and depreciating currency, it can destabilise a number of macroeconomic variables and financial arithmetic of the government and the corporate world,” said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings. Yes Bank has forecast the MSP for kharif crops to add 35 basis points incrementally to headline inflation in FY19.Food items have a large 45.86% weight in the consumer price index (CPI) that RBI tracks. Cereals and products have 9.67% weight. High food inflation can push overall inflation higher.Fiscal risks on higher MSPs are not seen as big as inflation risks. Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank, said the additional cost outgo (estimated at 0.1% of GDP) is not expected to pose a risk to fiscal deficit target of 3.3% for FY19.Where a crop is not procured, the government may have to make deficiency payments to farmers, which is the difference between the MSP and market or mandi price. If the market prices are below their announced MSPs, as is the case now for many crops, then the outgo would be high.Home minister Rajnath Singh , while announcing the government decision to increase MSPs, had said the move would cost the exchequer over Rs 15,000 crore. DK Joshi, chief economist at Crisil, expects the higher MSPs to cost the government about Rs 11,500 crore, assuming the procurement of kharif crops would be as much as last year. “But the actual cost incurred could be substantially higher as procurement is set to increase,” he said.The government has set a target of doubling farm income by 2022.

Rugby’s world governing body has intervened after Zimbabwe’s national team was forced to sleep on the street in Tunisia following problems with accommodation and visas. World Rugby tweeted that “we are aware of an issue regarding the Zimbabwe team ahead of their Rugby Africa Gold Cup match on Saturday. We have received firm assurances from Rugby Africa that the issue has been quickly and effectively resolved.”
Zimbabwe’s rugby team, nicknamed the Sables, is in Tunisia for a test match in Beja that forms part of the 2019 World Cup qualifying campaign. The Sables had landed in the North African country on Monday night directly from Kenya, where they narrowly lost 45-36.
The team was initially delayed for almost six hours at the airport in Tunis because it did not have the required 600 euros to pay for visas and later declined to check into a hotel in Beja which the squad deemed substandard. Players then slept outside the same hotel.
In a joint statement, Rugby Africa and Tunisia Rugby Union said they “would like to express their sincere apologies to the Sables (Zimbabwe) team and management for this unfortunate situation … We would like to reassure the Zimbabwean Ministry of Sports, Zimbabwe Rugby Union and all partners and fans that the situation was addressed immediately, and an acceptable solution has been found. Tunisia Rugby Union took the Sables management to visit another hotel, which was accepted.”
The Rugby Africa Gold Cup is the continent’s premier test rugby competition and the winner this year will automatically qualify for the World Cup in Japan next year. Zimbabwe hired former Springbok coach Peter de Villiers earlier this year with the aim of qualifying for the World Cup for the first time since 1991. Zimbabwe drew 23-23 with Morocco at home before losing to Kenya.
Many in Zimbabwe, including former sports minister David Coltart, have accused Tunisian authorities of trying to unsettle the Sables ahead of Saturday’s match. But the Zimbabwe Rugby Union has also faced criticism. It was accused of failing to pay player match fees and allowances, with loose forward Takudzwa Mandiwanza allegedly being heard to claim in a leaked audio recording that De Villiers had to use personal funds to buy the team a meal while they were stranded.
Gerald Mlotswa, head of the national team’s welfare committee, disputed the player’s reported claims. “I hope that it was just the pure frustration of the situation in Tunisia that promoted his outburst in relation to allowance, and nothing else,” Mlotswa told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
“The fact is that players are paid in arrears, like most people. The camp allowances and match fees from the Kenya game were paid on Monday. The camp fees and allowances for Tunisia will be paid the following Monday. It’s that simple.”
Six African countries Zimbabwe, Namibia, Tunisia, Morocco, Kenya and Uganda remain in the qualifying picture for the World Cup in Japan. Namibia is firm favorite to progress automatically.

"British counter-terrorism officers have joined a police investigation after two people were found in critical condition from suspected exposure to an unknown substance near the English city where a former Russian spy was poisoned.
Britain's Sun newspaper reported that the man and woman had been poisoned and were showing similar symptoms to those displayed by ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia who were victims of a nerve agent attack in March.
The Sun said samples of the toxin involved had been sent to the nearby military research centre of Porton Down for testing.
The pair, both in their 40s, were hospitalised in a critical condition after being found unconscious on Saturday in Amesbury, 11km north of Salisbury where the Skripals were found slumped unconscious on a bench on March 4.
Britain has blamed the poisoning of the Skripals on Russia, something that Moscow has denied but which caused a serious diplomatic crisis between it and Western states.
""They (couple) are both currently receiving treatment for suspected exposure to an unknown substance,"" Wiltshire county police, which took the rare step of declaring ""a major incident"", said in a statement.
""Based upon the number of casualties affected, it is not believed that there is a significant health risk to the wider public.""
There was no word on the identity of the couple.
A police spokeswoman declined to confirm whether the couple were believed to have been poisoned or whether Porton Down scientists were now involved. But London police confirmed that specialist counter-terrorism officers were helping the inquiry.
""As Wiltshire police have stated, they are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding the incident and will update the public as soon and as regularly as possible,"" a London spokesman said.
Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said the government's emergency response committee had met to discuss the incident and is being treated with the ""utmost seriousness"".
The pair, who were being treated at Salisbury District Hospital, were initially believed to have taken heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs. More than three days after they were found, tests were still being conducted to ascertain what substance made them ill.
""We are working with the police to understand the circumstances surrounding this incident and it would be inappropriate to make further comment at this time, while we establish how they became unwell,"" said Cara Charles-Barks, the hospital's chief executive.
The hospital is where the Skripals also spent weeks in a critical condition in the same hospital before slowly recovering and being discharged.
Britain accused Russia of poisoning Skripal with Novichok nerve agent, the first known offensive use of such a chemical weapon on European soil since World War II.
Moscow denied any involvement and suggested Britain had carried out the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.
The attack prompted the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the Cold War as allies in Europe.",www.news.com.au,2018-07-04 23:57:01,18,421576
"Iran will uphold the nuclear deal if it can continue to reap its economic benefits despite revived US sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says.
The foreign ministers of Iran and five major powers will meet in Vienna on Friday in an effort to save the agreement that is meant to prevent Iranian nuclear armament, the European Union confirmed.
The United States pulled out of the deal and took steps to reimpose economic sanctions in May, leaving Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China to salvage the 2015 agreement that is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
""We will stick to it as far as possible, on the condition that we can profit from the JCPOA,"" Rowhani told reporters after meeting Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen.
""If the other signatory states can guarantee Iran's interests, we will continue with the JCPOA without the US,"" he added.
The nuclear pact that was agreed in Vienna in 2015 obliged Iran to curb its nuclear program and accept intrusive nuclear inspections to make sure that the Islamic Republic cannot develop nuclear weapons.
Western sanctions including an embargo on Iranian oil exports were lifted in return.
On Friday, the five powers are expected to present a plan to prevent renewed economic isolation of Iran in spite of the looming US sanctions.
Friday's meeting of the foreign ministers from Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China is due to be chaired by EU chief diplomat Federica Mogherini.",www.news.com.au,2018-07-04 23:57:01,9,421208
"New Delhi, July 4: The family that was found hanging in their north Delhi house voluntarily followed the instructions of one of the deceased during the mass ritual.
Delhi Police has found CCTV footage which indicates that no outsider entered the Burari house from 10 pm on July 1 till the next day when 11 members of the family were found dead by a neighbour, said a senior police officer.
The footage of a camera installed outside a house opposite the residence of the family showed that the elder daughter-in-law of the house, Savita, along with her daughter, Neetu, could be seen bringing five stools that were later used for the members to be hanged.
Neetu could be seen in the footage carrying stools accompanied by her mother. Police are now probing from where were the stools brought and what reason did the family give to the person for taking the stools.
The family had a plywood business and it is being probed whether the family got the stools from one of its customers, said the officer.
Around 10.15 pm, Dhruv and Shivam, the youngest members of the house, were seen taking electrical wires from the plywood shop. These wires were used by the 10 members of the family for hanging.
Around 10.40 pm, a delivery boy could be seen coming to the house for delivering 20 butter rotis ordered by the family.
Around 11 pm, Bhavnesh, the elder son of the family matriarch could be seen taking his dog out for a walk. He later returned to the house around 11.04 pm, said the officer.
Between 11 pm and 6 am, when a milkman arrived to leave behind milk cartons, no outsider was seen entering the house from the main entrance, he added.
Around 7.15 pm, a neighbour went upstairs and found 10 members of the family hanging and the elderly woman lying on the floor.
Yesterday, police recovered eight more registers from different rooms of the house which had philosophical musings about walking on a ""road to God"", ""overcoming fear"", and ""attaining salvation"".
Ten of the 11 members of the Bhatia family were found hanging from an iron-mesh in the ceiling on Sunday, while the body of 77-year-old Narayan Devi, the head of the family, was lying on the floor in another room of the house.
Devi's daughter Pratibha (57), her two sons Bhavnesh (50) and Lalit Bhatia (45) were also among the deceased. Bhavnesh's wife Savita (48) and their three children - Meenu (23), Nidhi (25), and Dhruv, aged 15, too were found dead.
Lalit Bhatia's wife Tina (42) and their 15-year-old son Shivam were also among those found dead. Pratibha's daughter Priyanka (33), who was engaged last month and would have married by the end of this year, was also found hanging.
Lalit had turned towards spiritualism after his father's death in 2008. He would often assume his father's alter-ego and speak in his father's voice and dictate messages from his dead father to either Priyanka or Meenu, who would pen them in the registers.

LONDON: After an opening two days in which seeds perished in the hot Wimbledon sunshine there was some respite on Wednesday as several favoured players eased into the third round.
An unprecedented 11 men's seeds and 10 on the women's side, including four of the top eight, failed to make it past the first round at the All England Club.

With the number of seeds set to drop from 32 back to 16 at Grand Slams from next year the rate of attrition will slow.
American Madison Keys, the 10th seed, made sure she was not amongst the casualties when she beat Thailand's Luksika Kumkhum 6-4 6-3 on Wednesday and there were also wins for ninth seed Venus Williams and number seven Karolina Pliskova.
While the loss of former champions Petra Kvitova and Maria Sharapova on Tuesday, not to mention Keys's friend Sloane Stephens the day before, surprised many, Keys said it just proved the high level of the field.
""I think it just shows the depth of women's tennis right now,"" the 23-year-old told Reuters.

""I think at the beginning of a tournament, you'd never know who's going to win. There are no 100 percent winners anymore. I think every single match is competitive.""
While 23-times Grand Slam champion Serena Williams remains the benchmark for women's tennis, the scramble to take advantage of her maternity leave backed up the Keys argument.
After the 36-year-old American won the 2017 Australian Open, five different players won the next five women's majors.
""There's just an abundance of talent but it's very unpredictable at the top,"" three-time Wimbledon champion Chris Evert said on the eve of Wimbledon where she is working as a summariser for broadcaster ESPN.
""There's 10 women that can win a Grand Slam. It's unpredictable. It's still wonderful to watch.""
Women's world number one Simona Halep, who moved easily into round two, said seeds were even more vulnerable at Wimbledon where players often arrive with little grasscourt practice.
""Here on grass, you don't know what to expect,"" the Romanian said. ""Some players can play best tennis. The top players can play a little bit less. You never know.""
The men's draw has already lost sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov, 10th seed David Goffin and number seven Dominic Thiem, the latter because of an injury during his match. French 17th seed Lucas Pouille was cast aside on Wednesday by Austrian qualifier Dennis Novak, ranked 152 places below him.
American Sam Querrey, seeded 11, and Canada's Milos Raonic, the 13th seed, both rolled through to the third round though.

"LONDON: Two days after creating a stir at Wimbledon with his new mega-bucks clothing deal, Roger Federer was back making a style statement with his dazzling tennis as he gave Lukas Lacko a 6-4 6-4 6-1 dressing down to reach the third round on Wednesday.
The Swiss champion was at his breath-taking best as he crafted 48 exquisite winners during a 90-minute match that seemed more an exhibition of his shot-making than a charge towards a record ninth Wimbledon title.

When Federer turned up to defend his crown in 2013, he suffered a shock second-round humbling by Sergiy Stakhovsky.
There was no danger of a repeat performance against Slovakia's Lacko, however, and a forehand swish on match point gave the top seed a 26th consecutive set at the grasscourt major.
Federer will face either Croatian Ivo Karlovic or Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff for a place in the fourth round.

"China will ""absolutely not"" fire the first shot in a trade war with the United States and will not be the first to levy tariffs, its finance ministry said on Wednesday.
BEIJING: China will ""absolutely not"" fire the first shot in a trade war with the United States and will not be the first to levy tariffs, its finance ministry said on Wednesday.
A person with knowledge of the plan earlier told Reuters China's threatened tariffs on US$34 billion of U.S. goods would take effect from the beginning of the day on Friday. Given the 12-hour time difference, that would have put its implementation ahead of Washington's. Other media carried similar reports.

But the ministry issued a brief clarification in response.
""The Chinese government's position has been stated many times. We absolutely will not fire the first shot, and will not implement tariff measures ahead of the United States doing so,"" it said, without elaborating.
Washington has said it would implement tariffs on US$34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6, and Beijing has vowed to retaliate in kind on the same day.
Earlier, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China was ready to act, though he did not confirm the start date for Chinese tariffs.

""China has already made preparations,"" Lu told a daily news briefing.
""As long as the United States issues a so-called tariff list, China will take necessary measures to firmly protect its legitimate interests,"" he added, without elaborating.
China's yuan rose sharply against the dollar on Wednesday, a day after the central bank assured markets it would keep the currency stable amid growing worries about trade friction, although stocks fell.
Chinese state media on Wednesday kept up a steady drum beat of criticism of the United States.

The official China Daily said the United States was intentionally trying to prevent China from developing to keep it from challenging the former's role in the global economic order.
""The U.S. has maintained hegemony in the military and financial fields for many decades. Now it is pursuing economic hegemony,"" the English-language newspaper said in an editorial.
""It has frequently waged wars against other sovereign countries and made use of the dominant influence of the U.S. dollar in the international markets to fleece other countries. Now it is attempting to resort to an all-out trade and economic war to hold back China's normal development.""
Widely-read tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, said the increasingly likely trade war would bring chaos to the world.
""Counterstrike is major economies' first reaction to Washington's trade war,"" it said in its editorial.
""It's hard to predict where these moves will lead the world, but Washington will unavoidably pay heavy prices for its attempts to change the whole world to its economic tributary.""
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to escalate the trade conflict with tariffs on as much as US$400 billion in Chinese goods if Beijing retaliates against the U.S. tariffs set to take effect on Friday.
Chinese currency and stock markets have been jittery ahead of Friday's tariff implementation.

"Nathan Lyon has objected to ICC’s rule to keep the stump mic on. (AP Photo) Nathan Lyon has objected to ICC’s rule to keep the stump mic on. (AP Photo)
Australia spinner Nathan Lyon has spoken out against the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) decision to broadcast sound from the stump microphone at all times and the introduction of audible obscenities as a new offence.
The ICC announced four new violations into its revised code of conduct on Monday – attempting to gain an unfair advantage (cheating, other than ball-tampering), personal abuse, audible obscenity and disobeying an umpire’s instructions. The governing body also introduced harsher sanctions for ball-tampering at its five-day Annual Conference in Dublin.
“I totally agree with the ball-tampering stuff, but to be honest with you, I’m not the biggest fan of the stump mics being turned up,” Lyon said on The Unplayable Podcast. “I think what’s on the field needs to stay on the field.”
The 30-year-old, who last played for Australia in their final one-day international of the five-match series defeat by England last month, believes players often curse at their own failings under pressure, which might not be the best example for young fans.
“I’m not saying swearing is OK, but when you’re competing at the highest level and under extreme amounts of pressure, sometimes you miss your skill and therefore an expletive may come out,” he added.
“But we’re going to have young kids watching so as grown men we need to try and pull our heads in and realise that we’re massive role models for the game.”
Australia are competing in a Twenty20 international tri-series against Pakistan and Zimbabwe and, having beaten both their opponents convincingly in the opening two matches, they face the South Asian nation again on Thursday.

"Scott Pruitt has become the focus of multiple investigations in recent months. (AFP)
Facing ever-growing scandals over the spending and behavior of his environment agency chief, Scott Pruitt, President Donald Trump appears close to firing the man he appointed to dismantle Barack Obama's green legacy.
The list of accusations levelled against the 50-year-old head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has grown almost too long to itemize in a single article.
Pruitt has become the focus of multiple investigations in recent months, including by his own agency's inspector general, two other independent federal agencies and by Congress itself.
All the charges share a common thread -- that Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general reported to have close ties to fossil fuels industries, appears to have used the position he has held since February 2017 to enrich his own family's lifestyle in violation of federal law and has punished subordinates who raised objections to his behavior, or who failed to show sufficient loyalty to him.
It all began with his penchant for first-class and private air travel while on official business, a bill footed by the taxpayers, in contravention of usual government practice.
Then came the reports of the large number of bodyguards he kept around him 24 hours a day, doubling the cost of his predecessors' security detail.
He also ordered the installation of a secure telephone cabin in his Washington office at the cost of $43,000 (36,000 euros) which critics found excessive.
Then there was the question of his personal expenses. He rented an apartment linked to oil industry lobbyists in a pricey neighborhood of the capital for a mere $50 dollars a night, a sum he only paid for on nights he actually slept there.
He also tasked members of his staff with personal assignments, including finding him another apartment, getting his tickets to sporting events and trying to help his wife find a job.
This week, Kevin Chmielewski, a former EPA deputy chief of staff who was sacked in February, told MSNBC news that he saw Pruitt pay back a young member of staff $600 she had been forced to put on her own credit card for hotel rooms for Pruitt's family during the celebrations for Trump's swearing-in ceremony.
Chmielewski, a Republican and Trump loyalist, also told CNN news that Pruitt allegedly used secret calendars to hide contacts with industry insiders from his own staff.
He was just one of a number of whistle-blowers at the EPA to raise the alarm about Pruitt's behavior to Congress, where many Republicans now appear to be losing their patience with the environment chief.
'Not Happy'
Until now, the president has stood by his zealous lieutenant, praising his work to roll back Obama-era environmental regulations that Trump says hinder economic growth.
Trump, whose decision to quit the Paris climate accords was vociferously defended by Pruitt, may be changing his mind now though with November's mid-terms looming and Democrats knocking his pledges to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington graft.
Last month, while praising Pruitt's ""fantastic job"" at the EPA, the president admitted, ""I'm not happy about certain things, I'll be honest.""
On Tuesday, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley addressed the mounting ethical questions facing Pruitt and said ""these things matter to the president as well, and he's looking into those.""
The cooler tone towards Pruitt recalls the changing attitude to other cabinet members who have been dismissed by the president.
Last September Trump said he was ""not happy"" with his health secretary Tom Price after multiple reports about extravagant spending on air travel. Price resigned shortly afterwards.
In March, Gidley said the president still had confidence in his Veteran Affairs chief David Shulkin ""at this point in time."" Two days later, he was gone.
And the ouster of former secretary of state Rex Tillerson in January was preceded by a stream of barbed comments and public slights from the president before he finally sacked the former oil industry executive.
Pruitt's fate seemed secure for the rest of Wednesday at least, since it was Independence Day and the president had no scheduled public appearances aside from a picnic in the grounds of the White House.",www.ndtv.com,2018-07-04 23:55:08,25,643784
"PARIS (AP) — A tardy Naomi Campbell triggered a dangerous media scrum as she entered Jean-Paul Gaultier's couture ode to smoking in Paris Wednesday.
It raised the heat in the already scorching atmosphere on the final day of Paris fall-winter shows.
Temperatures reached heatwave levels and sweating fashionistas fanned themselves with Gaultier-branded fans.
Here are some highlights of the couture collections.
GAULTIER'S ODE TO SMOKING
It's been banned in public — but smoking evidently has not been outlawed as a source of fashion inspiration.
The unusual homage by Jean-Paul Gaultier to one of the world's dirtiest, and most glamorous, habits made for a typically tongue-in-cheek collection of 73 varied looks.
A black bison tuxedo jacket had the words ""Gaultier Smoking"" emblazoned on the front.
It was a play on words on the French translation on ""tuxedo,"" which is ""le smoking"" — and one that continued in myriad black and white deconstructions of tuxedo looks.
A surreal variation on the red Fez hat from Morocco — a country famed for its shisha pipes — also made an appearance. It covered the face, and from eye slits, the red tassels seemed to hang down like tears.
Tulle mouth masks followed white plume boas representing plumes of smoke.
But the final creation — a giant silver bridal veil — was the most creative look. Its shimmering, five-meter (16-foot) train was so diaphanous, it licked the air and evoked rising smoke.
Pedro Almodovar's muse, actress Rossy de Palma, applauded from the front row.
___
ELIE SAAB
Elie Saab took his itinerant couture inspiration to Barcelona this season.
The famed Modernist architecture of Antoni Gaudi — and its organic lines — were the focus of many of the Lebanese designer's gowns.
Oversize rounded shoulders, which were sometimes dramatically raised from the body, were a new silhouette variation on the house's bread-and-butter cinched waist looks.
The industrious Saab couture atelier had got to work to weave the signature crystals, sequins and pearls together to — as the program notes put it — depict ""the sinuosity of organic forms.""
The swirling stone reliefs of the Musee des Arts Decoratifs venue, inside the Louvre palace, accentuated the clothes' architectural lines.

PARIS FASHION GETS TOUGHER ON PRESS
Certain Paris Fashion Week houses pride themselves on careful image control and restrictive press access.
As privately held brands, this is their right — although it can sometimes be excessive and lead to accusations of elitism.
Invitations are sent to carefully selected journalists and buyers, and some houses prefer smaller venues. The system is thought to increase the mystery and cachet of the clothes.
Like Balenciaga, Maison Margiela under John Galliano is one of many with a highly strict policy.
For the second season Maison Margiela extended their media clampdown to all photographic agencies, bar two, sending out a note explaining they would be handling the photography mainly ""in-house"" for Wednesday's morning show.
The unusual move means that almost all images of the couture are now under the direct control of the Maison Margiela house.

Brazilian police arrested General Electric's Latin America CEO Daurio Speranzini Junior on Wednesday as part of a probe into suspected fraud and corruption by multinational companies in the Rio de Janeiro state health system.
Speranzini, the former head of Philips Medical Systems in Brazil, was among 22 people arrested, including Frederik Knudsen, an executive at the Dutch company.
Police raided 44 sites, including the Brazilian headquarters of Philips and Johnson & Johnson, but not the offices of GE, the Rio prosecutors' office said in a statement.
Code-named ""Operation Resonance,"" the probe was launched with the goal of dismantling a ""suppliers' cartel"" accused of committing fraud to secure public health service contracts in Rio between 1996 and 2017.
The cartel, made up of at least 33 companies and led by Brazilian medical instrument distributors Oscar Iskin, was nicknamed the ""international auctions club.""
""Top executives from multinational medical equipment manufacturers arranged among themselves who would win contracts by paying a 13 percent commission on those contracts to Iskin,"" said the public prosecutor.
Iskin executives would then ""serve as a link between public health authorities and the cartel's companies"" to steer contracts away from ""competitors who weren't part of the cartel.""
General Electric issued a statement asserting that the accusations against Speranzini referred to ""a period when he was leading another company.""
Speranzini only became GE's Latin America chief executive in January, having previously held the position of regional health department president from 2014 to 2017.
He was the Philips Medical Systems chief for Brazil from 2004 to 2010.
Philips said it was ""cooperating with the authorities to shed light on the accusations that are several years old,"" according to news website G1.
Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices Brazil told AFP it ""rigorously follows the laws"" of the country and is collaborating with the investigation.",www.pulse.ng,2018-07-04 23:55:00,12,239551
"Roger Federer extended his flawless winning streak at Wimbledon to 26 consecutive sets as the defending champion crushed Lukas Lacko, while Venus Williams battled back to beat Alexandra Dulgheru in Wednesday's second round action. Federer delivered a Centre Court masterclass lasting 89 minutes as the Swiss star hit 48 winners and 16 aces in his 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 victory. The 36-year-old is now on his joint second longest streak of sets won at Wimbledon -- his best was 34 between the third round in 2005 to the 2006 final.
Next up for Federer is a third round tie against 39-year-old Croatian Ivo Karlovic or German world number 64 Jan-Lennard Struff.
In his 20th Wimbledon appearance, top seed Federer, a 20-time major winner, is bidding to become only the second player to claim nine singles titles at the All England Club after Martina Navratilova.
On the evidence of his ruthless demolition of Slovakian world number 73 Lacko, it will take something special to stop Federer making more Wimbledon history.
""I played very well. I felt good out there, less nerves than in the first round,"" Federer said.
""I'm happy how I am hitting the ball, good concentration on my service games and able to mix it up with some slices.
""Of course, you sometimes play the percentages, but if you do that too much it becomes boring, so I like to mix it up.
""I clearly enjoy the path more where it comes easier, not wasting too much energy is always nice.""
Five-time champion Venus Williams battled into the third round with a 4-6, 6-0, 6-1 win over Romanian qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru.
Venus reached her ninth Wimbledon final last year, but the American star was denied a sixth title by Garbine Muguruza.
She returned to the All England Club stuck in a rut after losing in the first round of both the Australian and French Opens this year.
Making her 21st Wimbledon appearance, 38-year-old Venus is the oldest woman in this year's tournament.
But she didn't look her age in making it 89 career match wins at Wimbledon by demolishing Dulgheru in the final two sets.
Asked if her wealth of Wimbledon experience was a key factor, Venus said: ""I'd love to have that extra advantage. If that's working for me I'm all for it.
""It's just about winning the match. If that's your best or not doesn't matter.""
Venus next faces Dutch 20th seed Kiki Bertens, who beat Russian world number 107 Anna Blinkova 6-4, 6-0.
Milos Raonic slammed 34 aces as the 2016 Wimbledon finalist won 7-6 (7/4, 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/4) against Australia's John Millman.
The Canadian 13th seed will play Austrian qualifier Dennis Novak, who beat French 17th seed Lucas Pouille 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (8/10), 3-6, 6-2.
Sam Querrey, the 11th seed, stepped up his bid to emulate last year's run to the semi-finals with a 7-6 (7/4), 6-3, 6-3 win against Ukraine's Sergiy Stakhovsky.
Querrey's fellow American Madison Keys, seeded 10th, celebrated US Independence Day with a 6-4, 6-3 win against Thailand's Luksika Kumkhum.
Croatian world number 55 Donna Vekic followed up her shock success against fourth seed Sloane Stephens with a 7-5, 6-4 victory against Sweden's Rebecca Peterson.
Romanian 29th seed Mihaela Buzarnescu thrashed British teenager Katie Swan, 6-0, 6-3 to extend her remarkable renaissance.
A year ago, Buzarnescu was ranked 213 and lost in Wimbledon qualifying -- yet now she will face Czech seventh seed Karolina Pliskova for a place in the last 16.
Former world number one Pliskova has finally made it to the third round on her seventh visit to Wimbledon after seeing off two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka 6-3, 6-3.
Former Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwanska lost 7-5, 6-4 to Czech world number 66 Lucie Safarova.
Bidding to win her first Grand Slam title since becoming a mother in September, seven-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams faces Bulgarian qualifier Viktoriya Tomova later on Wednesday.
The former world number one's serve wasn't working at full capacity in her first round win over Arantxa Rus after a pectoral injury forced her out of last month's French Open.
But Serena was still able to extend her winning run at Wimbledon to 15 matches -- a streak that encompasses her 2015 and 2016 titles.
While Williams made her Wimbledon debut 20 years ago and has reached nine All England Club finals, world number 35 Tomova is playing the main draw for the first time.",sports.ndtv.com,2018-07-04 23:53:27,34,552090
"Modicare, touted as the world’s largest health insurance scheme, aims to provide free health insurance of ₹5 lakh per family to nearly 40% of the population, or more than 100 million poor and vulnerable families.
New Delhi: Moving a step closer to launching the Ayushman Bharat-National Health Protection Mission (NHPM), popularly known as “Modicare”, the union health ministry on Wednesday started the process of empanelling public and private hospitals for the scheme.
State health agencies (SHAs) through state empanelment committees (SECs) will start empanelling private and public healthcare service providers and facilities in states and union territories (UTs) according to the given guidelines, said the National Health Agency (NHA), the apex body to launch Modicare.
District, sub-district and block level workshops will be held to brief hospitals about the empanelment criteria, packages, and processes and address any queries. “We have invited all private and super-speciality hospitals across India for empanelment as they play a critical and indispensable role in this mission. We are also trying to ensure that the empanelment process is conducted in a transparent, time-bound and non-partisan manner based on specific criteria, eligibility and guidelines,” said Dinesh Arora, deputy chief executive officer, Ayushman Bharat.
“Under Ayushman Bharat, both public and private healthcare systems will get strengthened and work in partnership to provide accessible and equitable healthcare services to all entitled beneficiaries,” he said.
The SHAs shall ensure empanelment within stipulated timelines for quick implementation if the applicants meet the essential criteria as defined for general or specialty care facilities. Facilities undertaking defined specialty packages are required to fulfil additional eligibility requirements. Specific criteria are outlined for cardiology and cardio-thoracic vascular services, cancer care, neurosurgery, burns, plastic and reconstructive surgery, neonatal/paediatric surgery, polytrauma, nephrology and urology surgery.
“The aim is to provide financial protection to 10.74 crore deprived rural families and identified occupational categories of urban workers’ families according to the latest Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) data,” said Arora.
Modicare, touted as the world’s largest health insurance scheme, aims to provide free health insurance of ₹5 lakh per family to nearly 40% of the population, or more than 100 million poor and vulnerable families.

The renegotiation of the NAFTA trade agreement is still on track and could ""accelerate"" after the US mid-term elections in November, Mexico's next finance minister, Carlos Urzua, said Wednesday.
Urzua, a respected academic tapped by president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to head his economic team, said he was optimistic on the talks, dismissing speculation that Mexico's newly elected leftist president would throw a wrench in the works.
""We are confident that after the (US mid-term) elections in November, things could accelerate very quickly,"" Urzua told Mexican TV network Televisa, adding that a deal was possible by the end of the year.
""President Tump just has to give the go-ahead,"" he said.
Lopez Obrador, an anti-establishment firebrand, was elected in a landslide victory Sunday, promising to bring ""profound change"" to Mexico. He takes office on December 1, the first leftist president in recent history.
A free-trade skeptic, he has raised new doubts about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Mexico and Canada. The deal is already under attack by US President Donald Trump, who has insisted on overhauling it.
Trump said over the weekend that he would delay signing a new version of the deal until after the November 6 elections, in which his Republican party is battling to maintain control of Congress.
The three countries have been renegotiating the deal since August, but the talks have stalled over a series of issues, including the Trump administration's demands for increased American content in cars and a five-year ""sunset clause.""
Trump's decision to impose steep steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada -- met with retaliatory tariffs by both countries -- only added to the strain.
Urzua said the incoming Mexican government would collaborate closely on NAFTA with the country's current negotiating team.
NAFTA is vital for Mexico, which sends 80 percent of its exports to the United States.
Lopez Obrador clashed with the business sector during the campaign, but has since gone to great lengths to insist his presidency will be business-friendly.
He reiterated a soothing message to Mexico's business community after meeting top officials from the influential Business Coordinating Council (CCE).
""We won't act in high-handed fashion. Nothing will be imposed from above,"" he said after what he called a ""respectful"" meeting.
CCE chief Juan Pablo Castanon said the president-elect had agreed to meet with the group every three months.
""We established working mechanisms for the transition period, which for us will generate a lot of confidence and an opening where it will be possible to work with (Lopez Obrador's) team,"" he told a press conference.",www.pulse.ng,2018-07-04 23:53:00,19,240118

""European markets have struggled ... hit by further China worries,"" noted analyst Chris Beauchamp at trading firm IG.
In Asia, Shanghai stocks twisted lower before US President Donald Trump's new tariffs kick in on Friday.
The US is due to begin enforcing tariffs on more than US$30 billion (€25.8 billion) in Chinese imports as retribution for what Washington describes as Beijing's theft of American technology and other unfair trade practices.

Beijing has vowed to respond with its own tariffs immediately, which Trump has said will invite far steeper US counter-measures, potentially covering another US$400 billion in Chinese goods.
""There remain worries about the impact of a possible US-China trade war on both the Chinese economy with potential fall out across the wider Asian region,"" said City Index analyst Fiona Cincotta.
US authorities have meanwhile blocked a seven-year application from China Mobile to enter the domestic market, citing national security concerns.
However, in a contrasting development, Washington has temporarily allowed Chinese telecoms company ZTE to resume some activities.

Concerns remain for the Shanghai stock market, which is down more than 20 per cent from its January high on concerns about a slowing Chinese economy.
The yuan is also under pressure, though it levelled after a rally on comments from central bank chief Yi Gang, who pledged to keep the exchange rate stable and avoid using the currency as a weapon in any trade war.
Oil prices diverged, after earlier climbing on the prospect of tumbling Iranian crude exports in the face of new US sanctions.
Saudi Arabia has said it is prepared to boost supply to balance the market, but traders are also weighing factors like Libyan supply disruption and rising UD demand.

"TEHRAN (Sputnik) - The Iranian Foreign Ministry has lodged a protest with France and Germany over the detention of its diplomat as part of the Belgian-led investigation into a foiled plot of a terrorist attack in the Paris outskirts of Villepinte, Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said Wednesday.
""Deputy Foreign Minister [for Political Affairs] Abbas Araghchi lodged a protest with the French ambassador and the charge d'affaires of the German Embassy over the detention of the Iranian diplomat,"" Qassemi said.
According to Qassemi, the two diplomats were summoned to the Iranian ministry.
The French ambassador also faced a protest over the annual gathering of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MKO) in Paris, which is designated as a terrorist organization by Tehran and accused by the Iranian authorities of involvement in the whole story around the detained diplomat, with the aim to harm the country’s relations with Europe. MKO is part of the NCRI, whose gathering was supposed to be a target of the alleged terrorist plot.
Qassemi added that the ministry had also summoned the Belgian ambassador and lodged a protest over Brussels’ request for Germany to extradite the Iranian diplomat to Belgium.
The Iranian diplomat from the embassy in Vienna was arrested in Germany on Saturday on suspicion of complicity in plotting a bomb attack on a rally of an exiled Iranian opposition organization, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), which was held in Villepinte the same day and attended by almost 25,000 people.

He is one of four suspects of Iranian origin, one of whom has been detained in France, and two others in Belgium. Iran has strongly refuted the suspicions against its diplomat as groundless.
Following the reports about the incident with the diplomat, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that Tehran was ready to cooperate with all the involved parties on the issue to discover the truth behind what he called ""a sinister false flag ploy.""
The situation around the Iranian diplomat comes amid Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s official visit to Vienna, where he held talks with Austrian counterpart Alexander Van der Bellen earlier on Wednesday.",sputniknews.com,2018-07-04 23:51:00,11,129105

In 2018, four journalists were killed in the country in the first six months,"" RSF said.""In addition, there has been a sharp increase in online abuse and harassment, and in the self-censorship which looms over the environment in which journalists carry out their work in 'the world's largest democracy'.""RSF issued an ""Incident Report"", an alert to warn about the deterioration of press freedom, the first time the organisation has done so for any country.It also warned India that it risked falling even further down its World Press Freedom Index from its current place of 138th out of 180.The latest murder of a journalist was that of Shujaat Bukhari, editor of an English language daily in the disputed region of Kashmir, gunned down outside the paper's office on June 14.More than 40 journalists have been killed in India since 1992, according to the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists.Reporters in India often face harassment and intimidation by police, politicians, bureaucrats and criminal gangs.RSF also took the Indian government to task over online hate campaigns and harassment by ""armies of trolls"" associated with Hindu nationalists loyal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi It cited the case of journalist Rana Ayyub being subjected to a ""hellish nightmare"" of online hate messages, sexist insults, faked pornographic videos and calls for her to be gang-raped and murdered.Ayyub's recent book ""Gujarat Files: Anatomy of a Cover Up"" alleges government complicity in anti-Muslim violence during the 2002 riots in the western state of Gujarat when Modi was its chief minister.Ayyub's ordeal has also earned the Indian government criticism from the United Nations special rapporteurs.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,2018-07-04 23:51:00,5,635534
"The proposed policies are meant to deal with the increasing digital colonization of India, said the people cited above. Photo: Bloomberg
Bengaluru: The government is preparing a policy framework to regulate foreign investments more closely in internet and smartphone businesses, especially in view of the increasing Chinese presence in these sectors, said three people familiar with the matter.
Government agencies including the defence ministry, information technology ministry and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), besides the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), are working on new policies, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.
The proposed policies are meant to deal with the increasing digital colonization of India, said the people cited above. The aim is not to stop or restrict foreign investments but to install safeguards that will ensure India’s security is not compromised, they said. This assumes significance as Chinese and American companies either directly control large parts of the internet business or have tremendous influence as investors in local start-ups, even in strategically important areas such as financial services and content.
Over the past 18 months, after Japan’s SoftBank Group, Chinese companies led by Alibaba Group, Tencent Holdings and Xiaomi Inc. have become the most influential investors in the start-up ecosystem. Xiaomi is also currently the highest-selling smartphone brand in India.
Given that Chinese smartphone brands control a majority of the Indian smartphone market, regulators have identified three key threats related to Indian consumers—addiction, surveillance and manipulation. The threats have been categorized under the acronym of ASM, two of the three people said.
“The deeper concern is around national security, while the whole thing is around colonization. China is at the heart of this entire debate, especially from a national security perspective,” said one among the two.
Some of these policies have already been implemented. In April, RBI issued a policy on the storage of payments system data, which requires digital payments providers to store data in India.
“To ensure better monitoring, it is important to have unfettered supervisory access to data stored with these system providers as also with their service providers/intermediaries/third-party vendors and other entities in the payment ecosystem,” RBI had said in April.
More policies on localization of data are expected to be announced.
The debate around data colonization has already alarmed sections of the Indian start-up ecosystem and there is a broader consensus emerging on the need to have proper policies in place to prevent a complete Chinese and American takeover of the start-up ecosystem, said a top India-based venture capitalist on condition of anonymity.
However, it will be tricky for India to regulate Chinese and other foreign investments in a strict manner. As a group, Chinese firms have become the most important investors in the internet business that most Indian institutional investors and companies have shied away from. Additionally, high quality, low-cost smartphones made by Chinese companies have allowed tens of millions of Indians to use the internet.
“Chinese companies are here to stay. They have become an essential part of the smartphone and internet ecosystem. The government cannot afford to turn away Chinese capital; so, any regulation will have to be light,” said the venture capitalist quoted above.",www.livemint.com,2018-07-04 23:50:42,23,158834
"US President Donald Trump repeatedly raised the idea of invading a neighboring South American country last year, despite the objections of his aides, a new report says.
In August 2017, Trump had a meeting in the Oval Office to discuss new sanctions against Venezuela and toward the end of the discussion the US president shocked his aides by asking why the US cannot simply invade the country.
Trump proposed a military intervention on the pretext that Venezuela's political and economic crises presented a threat to the region. The aim of the invasion would have been the forced removal of Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro.
According to an Associated Press report, both National Security Adviser HR McMaster and then-US-Secretary-of-State Rex Tillerson were stunned by the suggestion. After the initial shock, the two aides went out of their way to explain to POTUS that this would be a very bad idea.
They argued that a military intervention would alienate other Latin American nations who have long worked together to punish and ostracize Maduro.
The aides did not convince Trump at the time, according to the report, as 45 pointed out that US invasions of Panama and Grenada during the 1980s were what the president considered to be big successes.
The next day, Trump publicly announced — without first consulting his cabinet — that a military option for Venezuela was on the table.
""We're all over the world and we have troops all over the world in places that are very very far away, Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering and dying. We have many options for Venezuela including a possible military option if necessary,"" he said, speaking from his New Jersey golf course at Bedminster.
Caracas reacted by calling Trump's idea ""supreme extremism"" and ""an act of craziness.""
© REUTERS / Andres Martinez Casares EXCLUSIVE: Why Everything the Western Media Tells You About Venezuela is Lies
Later, Trump discussed the idea with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos in private. And later in September, Trump openly proposed the idea of invasion to a meeting of several Latin American leaders — Santos included — after a UN General Assembly summit.
""My staff told me not to say this,"" Trump remarked, before asking the South American leaders if they are sure that military operation was unnecessary. Everyone at the table affirmed that they were sure that the United States should not invade Venezuela.
The NSA's McMaster convinced Trump to let go of the idea, and 45's interest in it has now reportedly subsided.
Both McMaster and Tillerson later left the president's cabinet.
Between 1898 and 1994 the US has militarily intervened in Latin America at least 41 times, including direct interventions in Cuba, Guatemala and Panama, as well as providing indirect support for dictators in Chile and El Salvador, ThinkProgress notes.
Unlike Panama and Grenada, if Trump had been allowed to attack Venezuela, he would have been faced with a country with a population roughly equal to that of Iraq; the former two countries combined comprise only 13 percent of Venezuela's total number.",sputniknews.com,2018-07-04 23:49:07,20,128835
"SINGAPORE: The Moments of Life initiative, which bundles services and information for citizens when they need it, represents a ""fundamental shift"" in the public service's mindset, Minister-in-charge of the Public Service Chan Chun Sing said on Wednesday (Jul 4).
The initiative, which was first announced last year as one of five Smart Nation strategic national projects, was one of the examples cited by Mr Chan on how the public service has continuously sought to improve its services to citizens.

""All these projects show a gradual but definite shift in the public service - that today, increasingly so, as we organise ourselves, our mindset is not how we serve our organisational needs, but how we serve the people,"" Mr Chan said during the Public Sector Transformation Awards ceremony.

""The people are at the centre of all that we do. This is the mindset that encourages me a lot when I see the public service in action because it tells us that we have the correct people with the correct values.”
ADOPTING NEW SKILL SETS

Addressing a crowd of about 900 attendees, including public service officers, Mr Chan highlighted the importance of continuously adopting new skill sets. These include building digital capabilities, designing policies and services from the people’s perspective, and coming up with whole-of-Government solutions.
Mr Chan said new programmes to help upgrade the digital literacy of public servants will be rolled out over time.
""Increasingly, the types of problems we face will be inter-disciplinary and inter-agency,"" said Mr Chan, who cited the example of the Housing and Development Board (HDB). ""Today, when HDB designs towns, it is not just designing flats and precincts for housing needs. HDB also looks at it from a social perspective – how do we design our towns to enable and enhance interaction and mixing? How do we design our estates such that today’s need for privacy do not lead to social isolation when people grow old?”

Mr Chan also emphasised the importance of collaboration both within and across agencies, as well as with society: ""Collaboration starts from the basic premise that we have the humility to admit and accept that we can’t do it alone, and we do not always have the best ideas within our agencies.”
""It may sound daunting that we have all these new things to do, but we do not need to be afraid,"" said Mr Chan. ""If we can do these things progressively, module by module, and expose our officers to these new skills, I’m quite confident that we will continue to remain at the forefront.”
""We have reached a high level and are respected throughout the world for many of the things we do, but we are never satisfied just because of where we are. We know that many other cities are trying to copy what we do, and perhaps even overtake us. And this is why we can never be complacent about being the best.”

During the ceremony, 400 awards were given out to individuals and teams in recognition of their excellent service and innovation. One of them was Mr George Lim, operations manager at CHIJ Kellock, who was honoured for his innovations at his workplace.
The 56-year-old had redesigned a trolley used to move tables and chairs to include an extra wheel and foot pedal, for the benefit of his team of operations support officers - many of whom are aged between 60 and 80.
""We saw a lot of staff moving tables and chairs using a simple trolley. And they have to literally manhandle the trolley itself – lifting it by muscle and pushing it from point A to B,"" said Mr Lim.
""Each time they carry heavy tables and chairs – I’m talking about 40 to 50kg of weight. And every time they carry about 400-500 tables and chairs.
""At the end of an hour, they will be so tired (with) muscle back pain. This cannot carry on, so we had to think of something that can make it easy for them to transport all these equipment from point to point without injuring themselves,"" he said.
For his innovation, Mr Lim was awarded with a distinguished star service award, which recognises public officers with high standards of service excellence.",www.channelnewsasia.com,2018-07-04 23:49:00,26,204815
"MCA had overall received a very lukewarm response for the coach’s job. (Express File Photo) MCA had overall received a very lukewarm response for the coach’s job. (Express File Photo)
FORMER INDIA wicket-keeper Ajay Ratra has thrown his hat in the ring for the Mumbai Ranji team coach’s job. The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) had invited applications from candidates for Mumbai’s senior and under-19 teams, the deadline for which ended on Tuesday. Ratra is one of three former first-class cricketers, off-spinner Ramesh Powar and Mumbai wicket-keeper Vinayak Samant, to have applied for the senior team coach’s role.
Former players including Maharashtra’d Nandan Phadnis, Vidarbha off-spinner Pritam Gandhe and former Mumbai under-19 coach Vinod Raghvan are learnt to have applied for both jobs.
Ratra was coach of the Punjab Ranji Trophy team till last year. “I’m still to get clarity from Punjab whether they want me to continue or not. I checked with the association but they said there is some case date which is scheduled in the coming days. When Mumbai’s invitation came out, I straight away applied for it. It’s a big team and I felt I could contribute more. I can share my experience and get the best from the players there,” 36-year-old Ratra told The Indian Express.
MCA had overall received a very lukewarm response for the coach’s job to replace Sameer Dighe, who stepped down after only one year in office. Mumbai had a disappointing domestic season last year, failing to make a mark in any of the competitions.
Ratra played 6 Tests and 12 ODIs, all in 2002, and remained a mainstay for Haryana behind the wickets for nearly 15 years before calling it quits from first-class cricket following the 2012-13 season. Powar, who has played the role of spin consultant in the past, has expressed his desire to coach the Mumbai team, whom he represented with great success for many years, on numerous occasions in the past. His long-standing former teammate Samant, meanwhile, has coached the Mumbai under-23 team earlier.
Former off-spinner Gandhe has been a national junior selector while also having been involved in camps organised by the Zonal Cricket Academy.
Meanwhile,the MCA has received eight applications for the under-19 coach’s role. They include Suresh Shetty, Vikrant Gonnade, Usman Malvi, Pradeep Kasliwal, Kiran Powar, Sandeep Dahad, Santosh Saxena and Manoj Joglekar.

"New Delhi: Celebrated Indian wrestler Sushil Kumar lost his first bout in more than four years while competing at Tbilisi Grand Prix in Georgia even as his compatriot Bajrang Punia progressed to the semi-finals.
Sushil lost 4-8 to Polish grappler Andrzej Piotr Sokalski in the 74 kg category. This was not an ideal result for Sushil in the build-up to the Asian Games. The WFI had exempted him from trials held last month.
The 35-year-old was handed exemption, given his past result and form as he had won his third CWG gold in Gold Coast.

“Some people say how can people eat their words, for me, I will eat my words if it is nutritious enough and if that is what I have to do to have peace in the family,” Oshiomhole said.
He expressed appreciation to members of the party for his election and for entrusting with him, the responsibility to pilot the party’s affairs at this time.
He acknowledged that he new of the party’s challenges before accepting the task, saying that it was a huge opportunity for him and other newly elected executives of the party to make a difference.

He also said that everybody in the party matters, adding that he would run an inclusive party.
“I pray for wisdom and courage and I believe that we have it and we will deploy it for peace within the APC family,Oshiomhole said.
Senator Ali Ndume, in a separate interview dismissed the new group.
He said the threat by the R-APC and nPDP to leave the APC would never spell doom for it, but only God and time would tell.
The Senator who admitted that politics is all about interest, said there was however, nothing wrong if an aggrieved group voices out its displeasure.
He added that movement from one political party to another is normal in politics.
“What is happening is part of politics, especially now in our political days, all of us are Nigerians and we know what is happening.
“So, politics is about interest and if somebody feels that his or her interest will be more protected by voicing out his dissent, it is Ok.
“This party is a party of time, decided by Nigerian masses and it is only God that can decide the time of a political party: God and Nigerians know that APC government is the light at the end of the tunnel,”the Senator said.

"Erdogan will have the authority to appoint and sack ministers, judges and other state officials (AFP)
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will on Monday be sworn in for a second mandate as Turkey's head of state after his election triumph last month, assuming sweeping powers granted under a new constitution, a presidential source said.
Erdogan, who has dominated Turkey first as premier from 2003 then president from 2014, scored an outright victory in the first round of the June 24 elections with 52.6 percent of the vote.
Those elections were particularly crucial as it is only after the polls that the new presidential system, which was agreed in a 2017 referendum and opponents fear will lead to one man rule, comes into force.
Erdogan will be sworn at the parliament, a presidential source, who asked not to be named, told AFP. State media reports said the oath ceremony would be at 1300 GMT.
Two hours later a ""transition ceremony"" marking the shift to the new system will take place at his vast presidential palace on the outskirts of Ankara, Anadolu news agency reported.
The Turkish leader is expected to deliver a speech during the ceremony to be attended by leading figures from the business, art and sports as well as foreign heads of state, according to the Hurriyet daily.
The ceremony will be followed by a dinner and then Erdogan is due to announce his new cabinet, it said.
Under the new system, Erdogan will enjoy greater powers with the authority to appoint and sack ministers, judges and other state officials.
The post of prime minister, currently held by Erdogan's ally Binali Yildirim, is to be scrapped as of Monday, leaving the president in full and sole charge of the government.
A decree published in the Official Gazette on Wednesday formalised the transfer of some duties and authorities of the cabinet to the president.
Also, the references in certain laws like ""cabinet"" and ""prime ministry"" have been changed to say ""president"" and the ""presidency,"" according to the decree.
The new regulations will come into force on the day the president is sworn in, Anadolu said.
The new parliament is meanwhile expected to be sworn in two days earlier on Saturday.
Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has failed to secure a majority in the 600-seat parliament on its own in the June elections.

"All existing industrial units and commercial establishments who are currently using fuels that are not approved under the notification have been asked to switch over to approved fuels within 90 days. (Reuters)
The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has issued a notification with a list of fuels permissible for industrial use within the NCT of Delhi, a move which has been hailed by the Centre for Science and Environment.
All existing industrial units and commercial establishments who are currently using fuels that are not approved under the notification have been asked to switch over to approved fuels within 90 days.
“All other fuels will deemed unapproved and so disallowed for use in NCT of Delhi,” the notification read.
Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy, CSE, said, “Dust particles in the air get coated with toxic substances from combustion and can go deep into the lungs. Cleaner fuels for combustion are an important step forward to reduce the toxicity of emissions.
“Clean fuels not only improve the efficiency of emissions control systems, but also reduce emissions of toxic compounds and lower the risk to human health. CSE has been advocating for this notification for some time now.”
The new notification has permitted the fuels including Bharat Stage VI compliant petrol and diesel with 10 ppm sulphur, Liquid Petroleum Gas, Natural gas/Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Aviation turbine fuel, Firewood for crematoriums and for other religious purposes, Wood charcoal for Tandoors and grilles of hotels/restaurants/banquet halls/eateries having emission channelization/control systems and Biogas.
According to the notification, coal with low sulphur (less than 0.4 per cent) will be permitted for use only in thermal power plants.
“This notification, thus, virtually eliminates the use of coal from everything except in power plants, where coal with less than 0.4 per cent sulphur will be permitted. But Delhi has also taken the decision to shut down its coal power plants, including the Badarpur plant.
“With coal and other dirty fuels like petcoke and furnace oil banned, industrial units will have to shift to cleaner alternatives such as piped natural gas, electricity or BS-VI diesel. It is encouraging to note that use of natural gas by industries has expanded now in Delhi,” Roychowdhury said.
This new notification is an amendment of the original list of approved fuels notified by the Delhi government on August 27, 1996, a decision which was precipitated by the widespread use of dirty domestic and industrial fuels in the city.",www.financialexpress.com,2018-07-04 23:46:01,14,244475
"KAZAN, Russia (AP) — Four years after Brazil's humiliation at its home World Cup, Thiago Silva is back to his best in Russia, a country where his then-burgeoning career was almost tragically cut short years ago.
The 33-year-old Brazil center back — who is nicknamed ""O Monstro"" for his exceptional physical abilities — is probably playing in his final World Cup, and he has been enjoying a perfect tournament so far.
While forward Neymar attracted negative comments for his antics on the field, Silva has been irreproachable. The captain arguably has been the best center back of the tournament, alongside Uruguay captain Diego Godin.
Like Uruguay, Brazil has conceded only one goal in Russia so far, from a set piece in its opening 1-1 draw with Switzerland . And the Selecao's rivals have managed only five shots on target in their four matches against the five-time champions.
Silva has been playing a key role in helping Brazil achieve those impressive statistics, anchoring the defense with authority and class. During the 2-0 win against Mexico that guaranteed Brazil advanced to the quarterfinals for the seventh consecutive time, Silva was decisive both in the air and on the ground, blocked several shots and made two clearances.
""It's a huge joy to be doing an excellent cup and to be growing with every game,"" Silva said. ""I'm happy about my performance, and the performance of the team.""
Happiness and joy have been hard to come by during some stretches of Silva's career.
The native of Rio de Janeiro went through hard times after Brazil's 7-1 loss to Germany at the last World Cup. Silva did not play in that game because he was suspended, but he was harshly criticized and branded a cry baby for his emotional outbursts as he was pictured in tears before a penalty shootout against Chile in the round of 16.
After the tournament, he was stripped of the team's captaincy by new coach Dunga, then left off the regular roster after the 2015 Copa America. He returned from exile in September 2016 for World Cup qualifiers after being called up by Dunga's successor, Tite.
Those professional ups and downs are nothing compared to the ordeal Silva went through back in 2005, when he spent about six months in a Moscow hospital after he contracted tuberculosis. Regarded at the time as one of the world's most promising defenders, Silva had been sent on loan from Porto to Dynamo Moscow alongside several teammates.
""It was probably the worst episode of my life,"" Silva said.
It was during a training camp in Portugal that doctor Yuri Vassilkov, who had traveled along with the team, noticed that Silva had a persistent cough.
""He had temperature and we thought it was a simple cold,"" Vassilkov said in an interview with L'Equipe newspaper this week. ""I gave him some medication but he did not improve. I was a bit worried and I sent him for exams at the British hospital in Lisbon. The diagnosis was terrible: tuberculosis. It was a shock.""
Vassilkov believes that the diagnosis was so late that Silva was weeks away from dying.
Silva was brought back to Moscow, where he was hospitalized in a center specializing in tuberculosis treatment. At the time, Silva did not speak English or Russian and went through a bout of depression.
""The cold, the lack of natural light, the fact that I could not speak to anybody ... All this was very difficult to handle,"" Silva remembered in an interview with Belgian Sport/Foot magazine.
After Russian doctors at one point considered removing part of his lungs, Silva survived and fully recovered. He never played a game for Dynamo, and these painful events are just bad memories now.
""That would have ended my career. I needed guardian angels to take me away,"" Silva said. ""I was a bit overwhelmed in a friendly we played against Russia this year. It is different for me to play there. I hope I can erase that by lifting the World Cup trophy.""

"NEW DELHI: Several Opposition parties have begun work on stitching up state-wise pre-poll alliances against the BJP for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections to supplement their electoral strength and minimise BJP gains. Leaders involved in the exercise have said that prospects of state-wide alliances have brightened in seven states where the BJP and allies made impressive gains in 2014.States where Opposition parties are working for separate anti-BJP pre-poll alliances are Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu and Jammu and Kashmir. They account for 255 Lok Sabha seats, almost half the strength of the House. The BJP alone won nearly 150 seats in 2014, while its allies added another dozen-odd seats here.Apart from the ‘Modi wave’, the division among anti-BJP parties helped the saffron surge in in 2014, except Tamil Nadu. Though BJP won just one seat in TN, the AIADMK which won 37 of the 39 seats has been an informal BJP ally inside and outside Parliament. Sources familiar with the exercise said though announcements of alliances and seat-sharing formula will come about only after there is clarity on the Lok Sabha poll schedule, concerned parties have converged on the need for pooling their votes.It will be a kind of realistic re-adaption of anti-BJP alliance in 2004 before the UPA secured the support of Left and other parties after polls. Even in 2004, the alliance never projected a prime ministerial candidate.“The focus is again in working towards maximum possible statewise alliances, leaving the rest with the scope for likely post-poll coming together against BJP,” a senior Opposition leader said. The shared urgency to checkmate BJP in its electoral reservoirs means individual parties agreeing to show pragmatism in seat adjustments to avoid split of anti-BJP votes. While SP-BSP combine will take the lion’s share in UP, where BJP won 71 of the 80 LS seats, the Congress leadership, posturing notwithstanding, would settle along with RLD as minor partners. In the forthcoming Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, the Congress is likely to accommodate the SP and BSP in a limited number of seats. If this alliance works out, it could be replicated in the Lok Sabha polls in MP.In Bihar, where BJP and allies won 31 out of 40 LS seats, RJD, Congress, NCP and outfits of Sharad Yadav and Jitan Manjhi could come together. These parties will respect sentiments of coalition leader RJD which has rubbished the possibility of JDU’s ‘ghar wapsi’. In Jharkhand, where BJP won 12 of 14 LS seats, efforts are on for a JMM-Congress-RJD-Marandi alliance. Notwithstanding hiccups the Kumaraswamy government faces in Karnataka, where BJP won 14 of 28 LS seats, JDSCongress hope to fight LS polls together and accommodate BSP too. Tamil Nadu could see revival of the DMK-Congress alliance, where some other parties including Kamal Haasan’s outfit would be included.In Maharashtra, where BJP won 23 and Shiv Sena 18 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats, Congress-NCP have in principle agreed to have an alliance while accommodating smaller anti-BJP parties such as RPI (Gavai), Raju Shetty’s Swabhimani Paksha, Bahujan Vikas Agadhi, CPM, SP and RPI (Ambedkar) if the demands for seats from minor partners remain realistic. After the recent Rahul Gandhi-Sharad Pawar talks, state leaders will work on the nitty-gritty of the alliance and AICC general secretary Mallikarjun Kharge is scheduled to visit Mumbai on Sunday.With the break-up of BJP-PDP alliance, which won all six LS seats in J&K, the Opposition feels the electoral prospects of the Congress-NC has brightened. West Bengal remains the only big state where the Congress preference is not clear. National Opposition parties calculate that BJP in any case will not be able to match its hype on the ground in West Bengal.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,2018-07-04 23:44:00,18,635158
"London: Venus Williams praised Wimbledon chiefs after the tournament's much-maligned schedule-makers finally gave female stars top billing on Wednesday.
For the first time in 25 years, there were more women's matches than men's on Wimbledon's six show courts in a single day of play.
There were 11 women's ties scheduled compared to 10 for men as Venus and her sister Serena Williams, along with World No 2 Caroline Wozniacki and former US Open finalist Karolina Pliskova, were given the spotlight.
On Centre Court and Court One, Wimbledon's two biggest stadiums, two women's singles matches, including Venus and seven-time winner Serena, entertained the sell-out crowd in each prestigious arena, alongside only one men's match in each.
After years of being criticised for prioritising male stars like Roger Federer and Andy Murray, Wimbledon bosses have bowed to pressure and Venus, a five-time champion at the grass-court Grand Slam, was quick to salute the move.
""I was really overjoyed when I saw the schedule for today. We have a lot of equal play on the main courts in the other three Grand Slams,"" Venus said after her second-round win over Alexandra Dulgheru on Court One.
""It was just fantastic to see Wimbledon also follow suit. It's wonderful to hopefully have that continue, to have equal for the men and the women.""
Wimbledon chief executive Richard Lewis had defended their match selection policy earlier this week, saying the ""marquee"" matches were given top priority regardless of the sex of the competitors.
Whether women continue to get equal playing time on Centre and Court One remains to be seen.
Former Wimbledon champion Chris Evert suggested the men's and women's finals could alternate between the final Saturday and Sunday of the tournament.
Since 1969, the men's final has been played the day after the women's final, and Lewis has already quashed any suggestion of that changing.
Milestone
For now, Venus, 38, settled for acknowledging a welcome milestone for her peers, one that followed her own campaigning in previous years to try to secure equal prize money for both men and women at Grand Slams.
""I haven't thought about the pride level. I think it's just about being able to be a part of something bigger than yourself. Tennis will go on long after I'm done,"" the World No 9 said.
""I just want to see the sport rise, not just women or men, but just tennis in general.""
""It's wonderful to see women rise, and I'd like to see these tournaments just get bigger and better.""
Hinting that she could take a role in shaping the future of tennis herself, Venus added, ""I believe in tennis we can market our players, we can try to find a way to market our players better because that grows the sport.
""I think that would probably be one of the biggest changes. I happen to love branding, not like research marketing, leave that for someone else.""
""But perhaps I see myself in that sort of position after I'm done, or even now I think is a good time to maybe put into practice what I've learned from my businesses into tennis.""",www.firstpost.com,2018-07-04 23:42:38,23,196203

"TNPL is scheduled to be held from July 11 to August 12. TNPL is scheduled to be held from July 11 to August 12.
ON WEDNESDAY, the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) announced that they would be including outstation players in the forthcoming edition of the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL). This comes only a few days after the Supreme Court appointed CoA had issued guidelines to all state associations to restrict player participation in local T20 leagues to only those registered by them.
The TNCA’s decision to have an exclusive outstation player draft for this year’s TNPL, scheduled to be held from July 11 to August 12, was revealed in a press release. In it, joint secretary RI Palani stated that 112 players from 13 different state associations had registered for the draft, out of which 16 will eventually feature in the tournament. The registered players come from Baroda, Karnataka, Kerala, Hyderabad, Andhra, Goa, Saurashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir.
The TNCA’s decision to bring in outstation players for their league was taken on the back of a resolution passed during the BCCI’s special general body meeting (SGM) on June 22, which allowed players who appeared only “briefly” in the IPL to make themselves available for outstation T20 leagues. The SGM and the decisions taken there were of course deemed null and void by the CoA, who did not recognize the meeting. The BCCI members though have remained firm that the SGM was supreme and that the decisions taken there were unanimous.
According to the TNCA press release, meanwhile, the criteria for outstation players keen on playing in the TNPL was for them to be uncapped and not having featured at all in IPL 2018. These players are required to have a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from their respective state associations. Former India under 19 captain Unmukt Chan and a host of domestic cricket regulars including Kedar Devdhar, Sheldon Jackson, Dharmendra Jadeja, Shorab Dhaliwal, Amit Verma, Raiphi Vincent Gomez, Salman Nizar and Shaurya Sanandia are expected to feature in the league.
“Allowing up to two outstation players for each franchise is bound to increase the quality of cricket and the level of competition,” said TNCA joint secretary RI Palani further adding, “Playing alongside and against outstation players will further sharpen the skills of our players, and that was the thought behind the move.”
The Indian Express however understands that while the TNCA might have gone ahead and opened the doors for outstation players, the CoA will be issuing a directive to all state associations to not allow their respective players to play in any league outside their jurisdiction.
Earlier, in their guidelines, the CoA had put an eligibility of participants for these leagues. It read, “(i) Players: The participation of players shall be restricted to only those players who are registered with the Staging Association and qualify to represent the said Staging Association for the purpose of BCCI Domestic Tournaments. It is clarified that players registered with the Staging Association and/or with the clubs/districts within the territorial jurisdiction of the Staging Association for the sake of playing local matches/Tournament, but who represent another State Association in the BCCI Domestic Tournaments are not eligible to participate in the Tournament. For avoidance of doubt, it is emphasised that players outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Staging Association are not eligible to participate in the Tournament and that players can represent only one state association in a particular cricket season.”
It is not the first time TNCA have been at loggerheads with the board over having outstation players in their league. They wanted to go ahead with it in 2017 as well but couldn’t do so owing to the BCCI’s stand back then over barring outstation players from taking part in local T20 leagues. The BCCI’s change of heart on the matter during the SGM last month though has let the TNCA have their way.

"The amendment is also aimed at preventing the sexual exploitation of women at workplaces. (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational) The amendment is also aimed at preventing the sexual exploitation of women at workplaces. (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational)
In the wake of complaints on the problems being faced by women working in shops and commercial establishments in Kerala, the state government on Wednesday decided to amend a relevant act, aimed at ensuring a secure environment for them. The amendment is also aimed at preventing the sexual exploitation of women at workplaces. Various commercial establishments, including shops, hotels and restaurants, will come under the purview of the amended act.
With the new initiative, women working in night shifts across the state will get a more secure environment. The bill will have necessary rules to ensure protection for women working between 9 PM and 6 AM. Certain restrictions will be imposed on deploying women on night shifts. The decision to amend the Kerala Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1960, was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.
A government press release said that it was decided in the meeting to accord sanction to draft a bill for the purpose. This will be a big relief to women working in shops, hotels and commercial establishments. The proposed bill will also have various women-friendly initiatives such as providing sitting arrangement for women during work. This has been a long pending demand from women, especially from those employed in textile showrooms as they were not allowed to sit for nearly 8 to 9 hours while on duty. They had also staged protests, demanding the right to sit while on duty.
For women working in night shifts, among a group of five members, there will be at least two working women and the employer will have to keep in mind their dignity, pride and safety, the press release said. The women should also be provided transport for being dropped back at their residences, the release added.
As per the existing law, women should not be employed in these establishments between 7 PM and 6 AM.— Inputs from PTI

"In my articles released on Jan. 2 and Feb. 25, I tried to explain the interrelationship between U.S. President Donald Trump's unilateral policies along with other parameters and the turbulent developments in Iran. ""People are at the center of the protests and that makes the atmosphere in Iran very sensitive and provocative – governments pay serious attention if people are the main force behind a movement or uprising – it is more powerful in the sense that people can be both devastating for and/or influence the country's development,"" I had emphasized.
In addition, we can find no point in the history of the engagement and interference of the U.S. and the West, in Iran's domestic affairs, that resulted in better conditions for Iran. Rather, their interference through double-standard diplomacy and military threats under any cover have always had devastating outcomes for Iran. In this opinion article, however, I tried to answer some questions asked frequently these days as to why Iran is not taking necessary action; why Iranian authorities do not develop proper responses and where Iran is heading.
Since the beginning of the nuclear talks, the people of the country and officials have hoped the talks would lead to better living conditions in Iran. It would have been an opportunity for Iran to restore its image, damaged as the result of internal and external factors. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was a golden opportunity for not only the officials but also for traders and other economic actors both within and outside Iran, although there were still waves of distrust toward the U.S.' decision to sit around the negotiation table. Likewise, Trump's one-sided withdrawal from the JCPOA has broken down that hope. Fortunately, the EU is well aware of Trump's distorted approaches and policies and consequently declared its firm support of the JCPOA. Notwithstanding, we need more time to see to what extent the EU is willing to stand against U.S. policies, and whether the EU can fulfill the economic commitment of the JCPOA without a joint international multilateral decision.
But, what is going on in Iran? What we are currently witnessing in Iran is not solely the outcome of the U.S. unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear deal but the result of a series of phenomena that have generated consequential economic, psychological and political hardships; a climate of uncertainty hanging heavy over Iran in almost every area, with the effect of both internal and external factors, such as mismanagement, corruption, sanctions, threats of war and regional insecurity which have caused Iran to hemorrhage billions of dollars in an effort to save its economy and preserve its security within and outside its borders.
Social media affiliated with the West has carefully used this and provoked tension, sparking sporadic protests in various parts of Iran; although, some of the protests are unrelated to the current climate.
This has brought huge social, economic and psychological consequences and a climate of mistrust towards the government and the whole system. Mass media and social media in the Islamic republic have so far played little or no significant roles in defusing the provocation mechanism.
A small number of people in Iran no longer believe in the need for Iran's engagement in regional affairs in support of the oppressed and preserving its security and sovereignty. However, the fact is that this small group has little or no knowledge of who is who and what is what in security and strategic issues and tend to be misguided in these sensitive matters.Unsustainable financing practices, the limitation of governmental power and misguided government policies along with the lack of transparency in various areas have ultimately intensified the rial's devaluation, even superseding the value of the rial in 2012. As the result, the bleak economic situation has maximized confusion in society.
The lack of domestic unity and cohesion among various sections in the system of government have provided grounds for the current U.S. government to reach its ultimate goals without resorting to war. By targeting Iran's economic structures, Trump has used economic pressure as the ""Achilles heel"" of Iran.
Some of the political factions and fronts in the Islamic republic have unfortunately bowed down to international pressure and underestimated the historic achievement of the nuclear deal, totally oblivious that it is not the JCPOA, but Trump himself who is the source of all the problems since he pulled the U.S. out of other international agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Paris Accord, etc. This disunity and lack of coordination among the sectors in the system has forced the current government into a corner and prevented it from properly deciding on and developing proper responses.
Facing the challenges to come
The ongoing situation indicates that the whole society is in a state of limbo. Like the experiences of other systems of governments around the world, just a little more hesitance at responding to the demands of the people in Iran will provide the chance for the internal political and economic manipulators, along with the outside forces, to deliver the final blow. To avoid facing further challenges, more power and authority should be delegated to the current government; the whole system in Iran should become more transparent in its expenditures and budgets and, as the top priority, pay careful attention to the people's social and moral rights and welfare. It is no secret that ""a hungry man is an angry man.""
And finally, the nature of the developments and the direction Iran is being pushed is by no means comparable to its previous experiences. Nevertheless, it does not mean that the so-called external support, including the U.S. support recently discussed by U.S. congressmen Dana Rohrabacher and Doug Lamborn, will by no means deliver Iranians better living conditions or prosperity. No instance of U.S. and Western interference and engagement in Iran's domestic affairs has ever resulted in better conditions for Iranians. Rather, their interference has always led to devastating results for Iran in the long run. U.S. officials are continuously expressing their concern for Iranians' well-being under the Islamic republic; the same as they also did during the rule of Iran's last shah, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. However, U.S. officials should always remember ""people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.""

"JAL was told to deposit ₹1,000 crore with its registry by 15 June to avert liquidation of Jaypee Infratech Ltd. Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday suggested Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL), the parent of debt-ridden Jaypee Infratech Ltd (JIL), submit ₹650 crore to prove it is bona fide before the court, after it failed to deposit ₹1,000 crore as directed on 16 May.
However, no formal order was passed to this effect and the apex court asked JAL to seek instructions on the issue.
A bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud was hearing an application moved by JAL seeking a direction to the National Company Law Tribunal, Allahabad bench, to proceed with its plea on the approval to its master-restructuring agreement (MRA).
The application was part of a batch of public interest petitions filed by homebuyers in various Jaypee Infratech Ltd projects, seeking recovery of their payment made to JIL or delivery of flats.
JAL has signed MRAs with 33 lenders, the apex court was informed.
JAL also sought constitution of a committee under the aegis of a retired Supreme Court judge and comprising lenders of JIL and the amicus curiae for homebuyers.
JAL said in its application that the approval of its revival plan for JIL by this committee would “enable infusion of funds not only for complying with the order of this court, but also for construction of homes and early delivery of the same to the homebuyers who are interested in taking possession of their homes” within 42 months from the date of approval.
The Supreme Court on 16 May had directed JAL to deposit ₹1,000 crore with its registry by 15 June to avert liquidation of its subsidiary, Jaypee Infratech Ltd.
On an earlier occasion, the court directed JAL to deposit ₹2,000 crore to protect the interest of homebuyers. Out of this, only ₹750 crore has been deposited so far.
The case would be next heard on 13 July.",www.livemint.com,2018-07-04 23:37:48,11,158870
"Hong Kong lawmakers on Wednesday questioned the logic behind a government proposal to spend HK$8.7 billion (US$1.2 billion) subsidising residents’ electricity bills over the next five years rather than using public money to upgrade the city’s “smart energy” energy infrastructure.
Wu Chi-wai, chairman of the opposition Democratic Party, said the money could be used to pay for two major projects that the city’s two power suppliers are undertaking in the next few years, lessening the need for the firms to increase electricity tariffs in the first place.
His suggestion came at a meeting of the Legislative Council economic development panel to discuss five-year development plans submitted by the two power firms which were approved by the Executive Council on Tuesday.
The two power firms – CLP Power and HK Electric – told the government on Wednesday that to meet the city’s emissions targets and use cleaner but more expensive natural gas in power generation, users would have to pay about 3.5 per cent and 2.8 per cent more in net tariffs, excluding rebates, up to 2023.
CLP and HKE will be forking out HK$52.9 billion and HK$26.6 billion in capital expenditure over the next five years.
One project involves spending HK$2 billion to replace electricity meters with smart, digital ones that give users instant data on consumption. Another is to jointly invest in an estimated HK$6 billion offshore liquefied natural gas terminal that would enable the city to access more LNG from international markets at more competitive prices.
Currently, Hong Kong relies on a limited pipeline supply from mainland China.
“Has the government calculated the maths of using the HK$8.7 billion to fund the smart metering project and the offshore LNG terminal, thereby taking these two assets off the two firms’ balance sheets?” Wu asked. “This is an issue of making better use of public money.”
According to the regulatory framework – or “scheme of control” – the two monopoly suppliers are permitted to earn no more than 9.99 per cent of their net fixed assets. This means the firm can, in theory, make more if they build more.
The figure is to be revised down to 8 per cent beginning in October and January under a renewed scheme.
Wu said his suggestion was akin to investing HK$8.7 billion in capital works projects and allowing the city to reap the 8 per cent returns, rather than the power companies. “This could alleviate the public’s pressures over annual tariff increases and the benefits will last more than five years.”
He said the government should be investing in basic smart city infrastructure such as smart electricity and water meters, rather than pushing them onto private utilities and making residents foot the bill through higher tariffs.
Michael Tien Puk-sun of the political party Roundtable, said the government should instead study long-term subsidies to the public to keep electricity tariffs from rising above 2 per cent annually, beyond the five year time frame.
“The government will have to think of how to cover that difference in the long-run,” he said. “To do this, you’ll have to intervene and closely monitor the two firms’ fuel contracts. If not, their commercial decisions will directly affect resident’s power bills.”
Secretary for the Environment Wong Kam-sing called Wu’s idea “new thinking” but stressed that the subsidies were needed to help residents, especially low low-income households, shoulder the burden of tariff increases over the next five years. Tien’s suggestion was complex and needed to be further looked into, Wong added.
In response, Wu said: “Looking at opportunity cost is not a new form of thinking”.
According to the subsidy proposal the government will grant relief of HK$3,000 over 60 months – HK$50 per month – to each household. Wong claimed it would help offset most of the tariff increases for the five year period.
But neither Wong nor his deputies have been able to explain to how the figure was derived.
“Why not HK$100 or HK$200? There is too little information and they have provided not more than 100 words to approve an HK$8.7 billion proposal,” said Prentice Koo Wai-muk, of green group 350 Hong Kong on a radio programme yesterday.

"At least half of the world’s population does not have full coverage of essential health services, and about 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty every year because they have to pay for healthcare.
New Delhi: Providing healthcare services free of cost does not ensure equal access to women, revealed an analysis of data on over 19 million Indian households by the University of Oxford and George Institute for Global Health.
A smaller proportion of women than men received hospital care for gender neutral conditions across age groups and most disease categories, despite a state-sponsored insurance scheme in Andhra Pradesh providing access to free hospital care for poor households, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal.
The study analysed data on hospitalisation between 2008 and 2012 from the largest state-funded health insurance scheme in India, in undivided Andhra Pradesh.
It found that despite comparable proportions of women and men in the population, women had a lower share than men of hospitalisations (42%), bed-days (45%) and hospital costs (39%) for gender-neutral conditions. These findings were observed across 14 out of 18 disease categories and all age groups, but especially for the oldest and youngest women.
“India has one of the highest levels of gender inequality in the world, and as the benefits of this insurance scheme are shared within households, it could be that the healthcare needs of girls and women—particularly those not of reproductive age—are considered less important than those of their brothers, fathers and husbands,” said Vivekanand Jha, executive director of The George Institute for Global Health in India.
At least half of the world’s population does not have full coverage of essential health services, and about 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty every year because they have to pay for healthcare. As women are the majority of the world’s poor and, therefore, less able to afford healthcare than men, universal healthcare coverage is seen as a strategy to improve gender equality.
“Our findings have urgent implications for the current drive towards achieving universal healthcare coverage around the world, which we would expect to be of huge benefit for women,” said Sanne Peters, research fellow in epidemiology at The George Institute, Oxford.
“It seems that ensuring that everyone can access essential healthcare services without incurring financial hardship is not enough on its own to ensure equal access by women and men. We need to consider other barriers that women might face in accessing healthcare, which may include families prioritising the healthcare needs of men over those of women,” Peters said.",www.livemint.com,2018-07-04 23:37:15,12,159374

"In 2013, the Supreme Court clubbed the Sheikh and Prajapati encounter cases.
Three prosecution witnesses in the Sohrabuddin Shaikh and Tulsiram Prajapati alleged fake encounter cases turned hostile today, taking the number of such witnesses in the case to 77.
Four ‘panch witnesses’ (those present during police procedures) from Gujarat deposed before CBI judge S J Sharma here and three of them were declared hostile.
According to one of these witnesses Jitendra Mehta’s earlier statement to the CBI, he had been shown the spot where Prajapati was killed in the alleged fake encounter at Chapri, close to Gujarat-Rajasthan border, on December 28, 2006. He had signed a statement to this effect.
However, in the court Mehta denied visiting the spot and said he had signed the statement at the local police station. The prosecution then declared him hostile.
Jaspal Purohit and Jayanatilal Joshi had said in their statements that they were shown Prajapati’s body at a hospital at Ambaji, and also his blood-stained clothes.
They then signed the panchnama (crime scene inspection report).
However, Joshi told the special CBI court here today that he never went to the hospital, and police took his signature on the panchnama at his shop.
Purohit too denied visiting the hospital and said he had signed the paper at Ambaji police station as asked by officials.
The CBI lawyer declared both of them hostile.
The central probe agency has so far examined 129 witnesses, of which 77 have turned hostile.
Sheikh and his wife Kausar Bi were allegedly abducted by the Gujarat police’s Anti-Terrorism Squad from Hyderabad on their way to Sangli in Maharashtra in November 2005. According to the prosecution, Sheikh was allegedly killed in a fake encounter. Kausar Bi was also allegedly killed later.
Tulsi Prajapati, an aide of Sheikh and who was said to be a witness to the encounter, was allegedly killed by police at Chapri village in Gujarat’s Banaskantha district in December 2006
The fake encounter case was transferred to Mumbai in September 2012 on the request of the CBI for ensuring a fair trial.

"LOS FRESNOS, Texas (AP) — Gabriel Canas, a bus driver from El Salvador who fled his homeland after members of MS-13 stormed his bus, did an initial screening interview for asylum under the worst circumstances.
He hadn't spoken to his 9-year-old daughter since the Border Patrol separated them two weeks earlier. And in that time, he had been moved repeatedly from one detention facility to another.
""The day I had my interview, I wasn't well because they'd taken my daughter away. I was worried sick. I didn't know where she was. I hadn't spoken to her,"" Canas told a judge at the Port Isabel Detention Center in Texas, where parents of many of the more than 2,000 children who were separated under the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy await their fate.
His case illustrates an overlooked effect of the separations: Some immigrants complain that they stumbled through their first asylum interviews when they were deeply distraught over losing their children. The interviews can have life-changing consequences because they are critical to establishing why families cannot return home safely.
Not until a day after the interview did Canas learn through a lawyer what happened to his child. The asylum officer who conducted the interview issued a deportation order. On Monday, an immigration judge upheld it.
The judge cited new Justice Department guidelines that gang violence is not sufficient grounds for asylum. But Canas blames his poor interview and plans to seek another one.
Volunteer lawyers say parents are distressed about losing their children and having no firm date for when they will reunite, putting them at a big disadvantage when they meet with asylum officers from the Citizenship and Immigration Service.
The so-called credible-fear interviews at Port Isabel take place by phone within two to four weeks of a parent's arrest and last 45 to 90 minutes each, according to immigration attorney Jodi Goodwin. Getting an answer can take a week.
To clear the initial hurdle, asylum seekers must demonstrate a ""significant possibility"" that they can prove that they have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or political opinion if they are returned home.
They are judged partially on the consistency of their statements to border inspectors at the time of arrest. Attorneys say many asylum seekers, usually speaking through translators, fumble their interviews by holding back on details that may help their cases.
The risks of the interviews don't trouble immigration hard-liners. Many of them see the asylum process as a joke, saying it invites fraud by migrants who exaggerate claims and exploit loopholes to get into the U.S. When legal groups talk about flubbed interviews or asylum seekers who need to be coached through the process, hard-liners see evidence that migrants are rehearsing from a script.
Harlingen immigration attorney Norma Sepulveda is representing a dozen parents detained at Port Isabel, including Canas.
""The first thing he said to the asylum officer was: Do you know where my daughter is?"" said Sepulveda, who found the girl in Arizona after she was transferred there from Chicago.
After President Donald Trump ordered an end to the separations on June 20, border authorities generally stopped splitting up families for prosecution. But many at Port Isabel were arrested before Trump reversed course and are still separated. A federal judge in San Diego ruled last week that families must be reunited in 30 days, or 14 days if the children are younger than 5 years old.
Many of the parents have already been interviewed. Goodwin, who spearheads a network of volunteer lawyers, estimates that her attorneys had counseled about 210 separated parents at Port Isabel by the end of June. Most of them — about 150 — had already been through initial interviews.
Among those parents, more than half had talked to their children by phone. But they typically knew only that the children were in a government shelter and maybe the state or city where it was.
More than 3 out of 4 asylum seekers passed the screening from October to January, according to the latest published statistics. That approval rate may fall after Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to declare that domestic and gang violence are generally not sufficient grounds for asylum.
In Canas' case, the immigration judge cited the June 11 order from Sessions.
""It's not that I think that your fear is illegitimate,"" Judge Morris Onyewuchi said. ""But the cops I must follow have ruled that gang extortion, gang recruitment are not grounds for asylum.""
Citizenship and Immigration Services said it asks every asylum seeker if they feel comfortable proceeding and, if not, the interview is rescheduled.
""All applicants are asked about their health, to include their mental health and have the opportunity to discuss that issue as well as any issue that might impact their case with the interviewing officer. Our supervisors are directed to reschedule cases pending concerns that the applicant might have,"" the agency said in a statement.
The advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense sent volunteer attorneys to Port Isabel this week with the goal of counseling parents before their initial screening.
""We are talking to people who are distraught because they don't know where their children are and they're facing a complex, potentially life-or-death interview,"" said Wendy Young, president of the group. ""To have to face a complicated legal proceeding when you're so focused on the safety of your child, I can't imagine what that feels like.""
Canas, who was separated from his daughter at the Texas border, hopes to be reunited with her and to join his legal-resident parents and U.S. citizen sister in the U.S. His chances are poor, Sepulveda said, but he will seek a fresh asylum review.
""The purpose of coming here was to save my life and my daughter's life,"" he said. ""That's all.""

"NEW DELHI: Union home ministry has decided to constitute a panel under a joint secretary to periodically monitor cybercrimes and ensure compliance of complaints by social media platforms that are used to spread offensive content which could precipitate law and order issues, a senior official said.The panel under joint secretary, cyber and information security (CIS), would periodically monitor objectionable cyber content and push for better coordination among law enforcement agencies and state police to block, remove or take action against objectionable information, the home ministry official told ET on condition of anonymity. Information collated by the panel would be reviewed by home secretary Rajiv Gauba to take a call on whether any issue requires intervention for seeking cooperation of social media platforms in criminal investigations, the person said.The initiative comes at a time when rumours circulated through social media have led to lynching of several innocent people in the country. Last week, five people were lynched in Maharashtra’s Dhule district and two others in Tripura on suspicion — triggered by rumours spread mainly through WhatsApp — that they were child-lifters. Last month, Gauba had chaired meeting with representatives of social media platforms such as Google, Facebook and Twitter to discuss measures required to filter malicious content — such as hate speech and video linked to terror, child pornography and fake news — from appearing on social media.Officials have told the social media platforms to ensure compliance and also take voluntary action to adhere to the law of the land here as they do in other countries. In that meeting, officials showed a chart of number of cases taken up with social media instruments and action taken by them since last two years.If social networks are used to peddle information that contravenes Sections 69 and 79 of the IT Act, it has to be addressed in a time bound manner, the networks were told, according to ministry officials.

Dr Anthonia Ekpa, Director of Road Transport and Mass Transit Administration, Federal Ministry of Transport, said that the ministry would inaugurate 10 Truck Transit Parks (TTP) across the country in 2019 to reduce truck accidents.
Ekpa disclosed this at a news conference at the sidelines of the Annual General Meeting of the Sub-Sahara Africa Transport Policy Programme (SSATP) held in Abuja.
According to her, for government to resolve the issue of trucking, we are working to ensure that trucks are put in a particular location called the transit parks.
She said that the initiative will reduce the number of accidents involving trucks, as drivers of articulated vehicles will have a place to rest properly before entering the road.
The director said that apart from accidents that occur due to tiredness, many truck drivers go against the law to convey certain products at wrong hours.
He said that more enforcement is required to tackle the reckless of truck drivers.
Ekpa explained that the vision is to build transit parks in all the 36 states of the federation, starting with one in each of the six geo-political zone and areas that trucks usually transit from like, Lagos, Lokoja etc.
She said that the Federal Government was partnering with state government and private investors to build the parks.
She said the strategy to address the menace of truck congestion at the seaports and highways would help in moving agricultural commodities and solid mineral resources from the hinterland to other ports as well as haulage.

"Shot putter Inderjeet Singh has been awarded a four-year sanction by the Anti-Doping Disciplinary Panel (ADDP) of the National Anti Doping Agency (NADA) nearly two years after he was provisionally suspended for testing positive for banned substances, Androsterone and Etiocholanone, weeks before the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The ADDP had reserved its order upon completion of the hearing on 17 March. In the order passed on Wednesday, the panel held Inderjeet guilty of a rule violation for samples collected in an out-of-competition test in Bhiwani on 22 June 2016 and in the National Inter-State Championship in Hyderabad on 29 June 2016.
Inderjeet, who was provisionally suspended on 26 July 2016, will serve the four-year sanction from that date. It remains to be seen if the 29-year-old shot putter, a World University Games champion and an Asian Games 2014 bronze medallist, will prefer an appeal in the complex case.
The burly shot putter’s case is the last of the four high-profile athletes who tested positive in the run-up to the Olympic Games. Wrestler Narsingh Yadav, sprinter Dharambir and quarter-miler Priyanka Panwar have all been sanctioned.
Since Dharambir and Priyanka flunked the tests a second time, they are now serving eight-year bans. The Court for Arbitration of Sport handed Narsingh a four-year suspension in Rio after the NADA ADDP declared him not guilty of a rule violation.
Inderjeet’s case aroused much interest since the National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) had first declared a sample negative and then reversed its finding. The shot-putter’s lawyer Anish Dayal drew the panel’s focus on the procedural lapses but the ADDP was not convinced that any of these had led to the samples testing positive.
The twists and turns in the case included the refusal of the Dope Control Officer and a Junior Analyst at the National Dope Testing Laboratory (NTDL) to depose before the ADDP. The failure of a laboratory equipment during the test meant that the sample being tested had to be stored as an aliquot for nearly a fortnight.
The case was heard by an ADDP from January 2017, but it was unable to arrive at a conclusion before its tenure ended in November last year. The NADA panel, chaired by Manik Dogra, resumed hearing the complex case in December last and reserved its order in the third week of March.
The panel believed that the two main questions for consideration were whether there were material departures from the international standards during the collection and analysis of the samples, and whether such departures, if any, would result in vitiating the entire testing procedure. While the panel answered the first question in Inderjeet’s favour, it ruled against him in the second.
The panel, which included Dr Rana Chengappa and former India hockey captain Jagbir Singh, did not ignore the fact that there were “serious departures” from WADA guidelines during testing. It has suggested that NDTL improve its Standard Operation Procedures so that such lapses do not occur in the future.
However, despite such departures from the guidelines, ADDP said that the onus of proving that the deviations have vitiated the testing procedure to such an extent that the result of the tests could be annulled lay with the athlete. A special witness that Inderjeet secured to testify in his favour – a former employee of the NDTL – was unable to swing the arguments his way.
Interestingly, the panel included an observation that can become a beacon for the anti-doping proponents and as a lesson for those who keep arguing that an athlete has been tested several times in the past and held a clean record.
“The fact that the athlete has previously tested negative for a prohibited substance is not a valid consideration for evaluating the adverse analytical finding (AAF) in the current test. His intent, negligence or otherwise, is secondary and it is for the athlete to disprove the findings of an AAF. Unless the athlete disproves the findings, the presumption is against the athlete,” the order stated.
Along with a recent order in discus thrower Arjun Yadav’s case which indicated that NDTL’s testing did not find traces of a banned substance in his sample but the tests in a laboratory in Cologne reported it positive, it can be reckoned that NDTL will come under some pressure from WADA sooner than later to tighten up its procedures and avert any lapses.",www.firstpost.com,2018-07-04 23:31:00,26,195662
"BRUSSELS: Trying to create the shortest supply chain possible, a supermarket in Brussels is selling produce grown on its own roof only hours after being harvested.
Delhaize, a Belgian supermarket chain part of Ahold Delhaize, said it launched the ""Urban Farm"" project to satisfy the growing number of consumers who are concerned about where their food is sourced and eating healthy.

""The products are harvested in the morning at 8 o'clock and an hour later they're in the store,"" store employee Marie Delvaulx said.
The garden on the 360-square-metre roof also generates its energy sustainably with solar panels and by recuperating heat from the store building.
The farm - which this year produced tomatoes, lettuces and strawberries - operates year round and can withstand the cold months thanks to a greenhouse.
Creating a farm in a roof on city comes with some challenges. The produce can easily be destroyed because the farm lacks biodiversity to mitigate the damage from insects, and there also is the question of the weight constraints.

"Indian cricketers left for England without their contracts. Indian cricketers left for England without their contracts.
The Indian team cricketers left for their tour of Ireland and England without a contract, the ninth status report submitted by the Committee of Administrators (CoA) before the Supreme Court on July 2 has mentioned. The report cited the BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary’s refusal to sign the new player contracts, saying it didn’t have the general body’s approval, as the reason for the impasse. The status report also spoke about “recent attempts” by the cricket board office-bearers “to hamper the effective functioning” of the court-appointed Committee. The next court hearing in the Lodha reforms case is scheduled on Thursday.
“… It is only when the Finance Committee failed to provide its views (on new player contracts) till the end of February 2018 that the Committee of Administrators was, keeping in mind the best interests of the players, constrained to announce a new remuneration structure for international and domestic players in the first week of March 2018.
“Even after the above decision, the Acting Secretary did not sign the player contracts on the pretext that they have to be approved by the General Body. As a result, the players had to leave for their tour of Ireland and England without a signed contract,” the status report said, adding: “The Committee of Administrators has been informed that the Acting Secretary has finally signed the player contracts only after the meeting (SGM) held on June 22, 2018, i.e. over 8 months after the earlier contracts had expired.”
The status report also took strong exception to the fact the June 22 BCCI Special General Meeting (SGM) went ahead despite the Committee’s non-approval. It also explained why the decisions taken at the SGM had been declared null and void. The status report described the general body meeting as an act of “undermining” the CoA’s authority.
Reiterating that the SGM notice issued by the BCCI acting secretary was in “violation” of the CoA’s direction issued on March 15 this year, as it didn’t seek prior approval from the CoA, the status report said why it debarred the cricket board employees to be part of the general body meeting. And then citing the acting secretary’s response, it said: “The Acting Secretary’s response dated June 8, 2018 provided further indications that the real purpose of holding a General Body meeting was to undermine the Committee of Administrators since the said email contained assertions inter alia to the effect the Committee of Administrators is not authorized to take ‘decisions of a policy nature’.”
It further mentioned that despite the CoA’s objection, the SGM took place, which was why it directed the BCCI office-bearers/committee members/employee/consultant/retainer/service provider not to implement the resolutions passed at the general body meeting. The status report described the acting secretary’s emails with regard to the SGM as an attempt to “bypass/circumvent/ disregard decisions taken by the Committee of Administrators by calling a meeting of the General Body and characterizing it as ‘supreme’”.
The status report cited the Supreme Court orders to point out that the BCCI office-bearers are to function “under the supervision and control” of the CoA and that the Committee “has been empowered to issue necessary directions”. Aiming a dig at the office-bearers, it said: “… almost every decision of the Committee of Administrators which is not palatable to the office bearers (and other like-minded persons) is being characterized as a ‘matter of policy’ which (according to them) can only be taken by the General Body.”
Providing examples, the status report mentioned how the general body resolutions sought to exclude Puducherry, Uttarakhand and Mizoram from participating in the Ranji Trophy and the other BCCI tournaments despite the CoA nod, which “carried out” the directions of the court. It added that the SGM took the decision to extend the tenure of the erstwhile Anti-Corruption Unit head, notwithstanding the fact that he had attained the retirement age and the CoA already appointed his successor.
Asked about this, a BCCI official, demanding anonymity, said: “Whatever I have seen, the status report might not have represented the facts correctly. Certain emails will prove that.”
Meanwhile, the status report concluded that the BCCI office-bearers and those who attended the June 22 SGM are “attempting to subvert” the court orders. It sought directions from the court with regard to different issues including the finalisation of the new BCCI constitutions and elections in all state associations as per their respective amended constitutions after inducting all former players from the state as voting members.

"Police in Turkey has warned parents to be careful after the news of two missing children and the discovery of their bodies instilled fear in the public.
The Turkish National Police's social media accounts listed a series of simple steps for parents to better monitor their children and warned against contacts with strangers. The warning comes two days after the body of four-year-old Leyla Aydemir, who went missing last month, was found in the eastern city of Ağrı and a week after the body of eight-year-old Eylül Yağlıkara was found with marks of torture in the capital Ankara. The manhunt to find four other missing children in four cities is still underway.
Police have instructed parents to not allow children to ""have physical contact with people they do not know and keep a distance."" They also urged parents to teach their children how to react when a complete stranger touches them.
Internet use also poses a danger for children as it exposes minors to a wider world of strangers. Police said parents should reconsider using their children's names on online posts and minimize sharing their photos online. Parents were also urged to make children memorize emergency numbers, like 155 and 156 for police and gendarme and 112 for medical emergency services. ""Teach your child to stay away from strangers' cars and run the opposite direction against any possible danger. Teach him or her that they need to seek help from security forces if they get lost,"" the warning read. Children should also be taught code words against strangers. ""Devise a family code word that the child can ask a stranger or teach them that they should ask a stranger approaching them if that person knows the names of his/her mother and father,"" police said.
Children should shout, ""I don't know him/her"" if the child feels in danger while approached by a stranger. They should also not take elevators with complete strangers. Parents were encouraged to use mobile tracking apps developed for child safety and use GPS services to locate them.",www.dailysabah.com,2018-07-04 23:29:23,16,198027
"""The line of investigation is focused on the role of Lalit and his wife,"" said police.
The family that was found hanging in their north Delhi house on June 30 began preparations at least 10 days before its alleged ""mass suicide"", police said. As per a video footage obtained from a premises opposite the family house, the family bought goods used in rituals, five tables and bandage from shops close to their Burari home.
The Crime Branch officials on Wednesday visited the house in Sant Nagar and conducted another search.
Police said Crime Branch investigators believe that one of the dead couples -- Lalit Bhatia and his wife Tina -- tied the hands and legs of other family members before all of the them hung themselves from an iron grill on a ceiling of a corridor during a ritual prayer.
""In another video clipping, Bhavnesh's wife Savita and Tina were seen purchasing five stools at 10 p.m. on June 30. After some time, their teenage children Dhruv and Shivam were seen carrying electric wire, which was used in hanging by some of the family members.
""The line of investigation is focused on the role of Lalit and his wife,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police Joy N Tirkey said.
""The Crime Branch, which is examining the CCTV footage of the last two months, has found couple involved in suspicious activities. The couple was seen carrying goods used in ritual prayers from June 23 to 30. In one of the footage of June 27, Lalit was seen carrying a polybag containing items connected to Vastu Shastra,"" a senior police officer connected to the probe said on the condition of anonymity.
""Lalit daily recalled the previous day's chores and listed activities in his registers and made lists of things on which he had instructed other family members to follow. He used to research on death and mysteries of soul. As per his mobile phone details, he often watched paranormal and ghost shows on 'You Tube' and other Internet platforms,"" he added.
""It was found in investigation that generally the family used to send one of their servants to purchase household goods,"" the officer said.
""An employee at a nearby restaurant said he delivered 20 loaves as ordered by Lalit Bhatia on July 30 night. The food packet was received by Lalit Bhatia who took money from his brother Bhavnesh to pay up,"" the officer added.
""Lalit Bhatia was last seen entering the house on the night of the incident. He was seen walking in the street with family pet dog which was chained in a room on the second floor during the ritual prayer. Their neighbour said that the family generally unleashed the dog during night hours and the pet was seen barking loudly on the fateful night,"" he said.
""Like his late father Gopaldass, who was in the Indian Army, Lalit gave all family members training in discipline, code of conduct, rehearsals of dos and don'ts during ritual practices. As per an entry in one of the registers seized from the house, he also instructed family members often to stand to position like soldiers after morning prayers for increasing mental strength,"" the officer added.
The police officer said visera reports were expected within 10 to 15 days, which will tell if the family's food was laced with sedatives before their deaths.
""We will take help of psychology and paranormal experts as prima facie we suspect it to be a case of shared psychotic disorder,"" he said.

Seventh seed Karolina Pliskova won a battle of former world number ones as she beat Victoria Azarenka 6-3 6-3 to reach the third round at Wimbledon for the first time on Wednesday. Big-serving Czech Pliskova reached the top of the rankings a year ago at Wimbledon despite losing in the second round — the fifth year in succession she had lasted only two matches.
From the moment Azarenka dropped serve with a loose error in the third game, Pliskova always looked likely to break that sequence against the Belarussian who is still trying to rediscover her past form after returning from having a baby.
Azarenka tried to fire herself up when she resisted some pressure to hold serve at the start of the second set. But Pliskova broke for a 5-3 lead and was then helped by two Azarenka double faults that brought groans from the sedate crowd who had been hoping for something more exciting.
“I think I was pretty solid today, I think I was really strong on my serve which was really important,” the 26-year-old Pliskova said after walking off court. “Very happy with my victory as it is the first time I am in the third round here. The last few years I was waiting for a good result and it still didn’t come, maybe this year is the time; I am feeling great.” She will play Romanian 28th seed Mihaela Buzarnescu next.

"Centre may file a review petition challenging certain paragraphs of the Supreme Court's verdict on the tussle of power between the L-G and elected government of Delhi.

Centre may file a review petition challenging certain paragraphs of the Supreme Court's verdict on the tussle of power between the L-G and elected government of Delhi.
After the Supreme Court delivered a landmark verdict on the tussle of power between the L-G and elected government of Delhi, Centre contested the AAP’s claim of victory and may file a review petition according to a report on Hindustan Times.
According to a senior government functionary quoted in the report, today the Supreme Court merely reiterated the special status of Delhi and the fact that L-G was not like any other governors of other states but has special powers.
As per the senior functionary, the AAP’s contention that Delhi is like any other state and the governor like any other governors has been rejected by the Supreme Court.
Supreme Court upheld,”Delhi’s special status as a territory and that it is not a state in the conventional sense. The LG still has the right to reserve decisions (taken by the Delhi government) for consideration by the President,” the official was quoted as saying.
According to the official, the L-G will not be able to refer Delhi government’s decision without giving reasons but he can stall the decisions referring them to the President.
Law and order, police and land are stated by the Supreme Court to be outside the purview of the Delhi government underlining the fact that Delhi cannot be a full state.
After the judgement, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that Centre will study the verdict and then react. According to the officials quoted by Hindustan Times, MHA is yet to take a decision on whether to approach the court against the decision as certain paragraphs in the decision are contentious and could be challenged.
As per the officials, the Supreme Court only interpreted Article 239 AA which deals with the National Capital Territory, but this Article has to be read in tandem with the General Clauses Act which defines a union territory with or without a legislature.
After today’s judgement, there are a total of 9 petitions before it, 7 filed by the AAP and 2 by the L-G, which will be dealt with by regular benches.

"Trouble brewing at Gor Mahia
207 Wednesday, July 4th 2018 at 23:27 GMT +3 | Wednesday, July 4th 2018 at 23:27 GMT +3 | Football By Rodgers Eshitemi:
[PHOTO: COURTESY]
As much as Gor Mahia officials may want to deny it, their house is not in order.
There is some unhappiness in the team's dressing room over unpaid bonuses ahead of today's must-win final group B Cecafa Kagame Cup match against AS Ports of Djibouti at the National Stadium, Dar es Salaam.
Gor Mahia's congested fixtures and unfulfilled match bonus reward promises seem to have began taking toll on the player's performance here.
Gor endured a busy schedule in the run up to the regional tournament that saw them play three SportPesa Premier League matches in less than one week and with the players claiming they are yet to receive their last year's league and CAF Confederations Cup bonuses, has led to a luckster performance.
K'Ogalo received Sh4.5million for winning the 2017 SPL title and have so far received Sh13m from CAF for their Confederations Cup Group stages preparations.
However, the record Kenyan champions are yet to live up to their favourites' tag after surviving scares in their identical 2-2 draws against Rayon Sports (Rwanda) and Lydia Ludic (Burundi).

And the discontent at Gor was made clear on Tuesday when captain Harun Shakava claimed the players were unhappy with the way the management is treating them after their lethargic display against Ludic at Chamazi Stadium.
""As many people expect Gor Mahia to beat teams, it is somehow difficult for us. We have played many more games (Confederations Cup, SportPesa Super Cup, the Shield and the league) than any other team here,"" said Shakava.
""But I think there is something wrong in the dressing home. I hope the officials will sort it out,"" said Shakava.
""At the moment, I can't share with the press what is troubling us in the dressing room. The officials are in a better position to answer this.
""The group is still wide open, so if we win on Thursday (Today) we will be through.""
Gor coach Dylan Kerr was disappointed with his team's performance that he publicly 'disowned' his own players.
""I would rather have 11 of the Ludic players that played today than those in my team. That wasn't my team today. My team played on Sunday. We can't really have excuses because I asked each of the players if they were ready for the match. We are missing that atmosphere in the dressing room and on the field,"" said Kerr.
However, when contacted, an agitated Gor Mahia CEO Lordvick Aduda denied owing the players any money.
""There is no problem with the management. Which bonuses are the players talking about? We pay bonuses with salaries. We are in Tanzania and their bank accounts are in Nairobi. So, which bonuses are you people talking about?,"" asked Aduda.
""I don't know what is the problem. I am not the coach and everybody was playing on the pitch. There is nothing like motivation. Let's stop insinuating things that are not there. If the team has drawn, how do you want to insinuate that there is a go slow?
""The Kenyan media is part and parcel of putting this nonsense into players' heads. How much do we owe the players in terms of salaries? Caf sent part of the money for preparation of the matches and that is not an income. We have already explained this to the players.""",www.standardmedia.co.ke,2018-07-04 23:27:16,37,502993
"NEWBURY, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul 4, 2018--Kahootz, a UK based cloud collaboration service provider, is pleased to announce the signing this month of two G-Cloud contracts, one with the Department of Health & Social Care (DHSC) and the other with NHS England (NHSE). Both agreements allow these organisations, and all their Arm’s-length Bodies (ALBs), to call-off Kahootz Enterprise user licenses using preferential discounted partnership terms.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180704005237/en/

Following a review of their requirements and competing services available via the UK Government’s Digital Marketplace, DHSC have decided to re-sign with Kahootz for a third G-Cloud contract term. Under their previous agreements, Kahootz collaboration sites have been deployed by the NHS Business Services Authority, NHS Digital, NHS Improvement, Public Health England, the Health Research Authority and NHS England. With assistance from these organisations, over 42,000 users across the UK health sector are already in Kahootz with each other, and this number is likely to double this year.
“When we initially short-listed, and subsequently contracted, Kahootz in 2014 we specifically requested an option for all of our ALBs to benefit from shared terms.” said Bob Armstrong, DHSC’s Head of Technology Services. “I’m very pleased to see the impressive adoption rates and popularity of the Kahootz collaboration service throughout our partner agencies. It’s certainly helping to empower our staff and stakeholders to find new ways to work together across the UK health sector.” Bob added, “We are also delighted to hear NHS England are keen to make the service more widely available across their ALBs to improve team working and knowledge sharing, locally, regionally and nationally.”
The new NHS England contract builds on the successful roll-out of Kahootz to support team-working, across geographies and organisations, on all of the Prime Minister’s Challenge Fund and NHS Vanguard projects. With an increasing number of requests from other NHSE project areas, an independent audit by Agile Elephant of the futureNHS collaboration platform (powered by Kahootz) was commissioned last year which calculated a first-year net operating benefit of £1.5m, rising to £8.9m in Year 2. The evaluation report provided a strong evidence base for the need for a collaboration platform in health and social care.
“The futureNHS platform is a secure, cloud-based collaboration platform that was initially intended to support the NHS new care models programme but is being used for much more and further programmes now,” stated Agile Elephant founder and CXO David Terrar.
“It gives them a single platform that spans boundaries and siloes in NHS, local government and third sector organisations, bringing people together to help deliver integrated care. It provides a new way of sharing learning and developing policy collaboratively, giving them intelligent knowledge management where stakeholders can work more effectively together in one place.”
Speaking on behalf of Kahootz, John Glover, their Sales & Marketing Director, commented “With these two call-off contracts in place Kahootz are now in a great position to help collaborations and service transformation right across the health sector and beyond by making it quicker, easier and more cost effective for NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care to involve their suppliers, partner agencies and key stakeholders. We look forward to working with them to achieve these goals.”

"A man and woman left critically ill in Amesbury were exposed to novichok, the Metropolitan Police's counter-terror chief has confirmed.
Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday evening, Assistant Commissioner for Counter-Terrorism Neil Basu said there had been a ""significant development"" after officers declared a ""major incident"" earlier in the day.
The development comes after officers were called to a home in Muggleton Road, Amesbury, on Saturday when the woman - named locally as 44-year-old Dawn Sturgess - collapsed and were called back later that day when the man - named locally as 45-year-old Charlie Rowley - also fell ill.
2:03 Video: Novichok victim loaded into ambulance
Police initially believed the pair became unwell after using heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs.
""This evening we have received test results from Porton Down that show the two people have been exposed to the nerve agent novichok,"" said Mr Basu.
The incident took place roughly eight miles (13km) from Salisbury, where former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were targeted with the nerve agent novichok in March.
Due to concerns over Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess's symptoms, samples from the pair were sent to the government's chemical weapons facility in Porton Down on Monday.
""Following the detailed analysis of these samples, we can confirm that the man and woman have been exposed to the nerve agent novichok, which has been identified as the same nerve agent that contaminated both Yulia and Sergei Skripal,"" said the police chief, who has 100 Scotland Yard detectives working with officers in Wiltshire.
""The latest update we have from the hospital is that both patients remain in a critical condition. Both are British nationals and are local to the area. Officers are still working to identify their next of kin.""
Image: Police activity outside a block of flats on Muggleton Road in Amesbury
Mr Basu warned of an ""increased police presence"" and officers wearing protective clothing as a ""precaution"" at several cordoned off sites in Amesbury and Salisbury.
He added: ""I must say that we are not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to. The possibility that these two investigations might be linked is clearly a line of enquiry for us.
""It is important, however, that the investigation is led by the evidence available and the facts alone and we don't make any assumptions.""
When asked if the pair were deliberately targeted, Mr Basu said: ""That is a theory but it's speculation at the moment. We don't have any intelligence or evidence that they were targeted in any way. There is nothing in their background to suggest that at all.""
Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, said that risk to the public ""remains low"" and said anyone exposed at the same time would have by now witnessed symptoms.
She issued ""highly precautionary"" advice to those concerned and said: ""As before, my advice is to wash your clothes and wipe down any personal items, shoes and bags, with cleansing or baby wipes before disposing of them in the usual way.
""You do not need to seek advice from a health professional unless you are experiencing symptoms, as any individual who had been significantly exposed at the same time would by now have symptoms.""
Downing Street has since confirmed Home Secretary Sajid Javid will chair a Cobra meeting on Thursday.
The developments come as video obtained by Sky News showed the paramedics who took Mr Rowley away on Saturday were wearing hazardous material protective suits.
0:33 Video: Substance victim 'foaming at mouth'
In the footage, the paramedics are wearing breathing masks over their mouths and noses, with visors covering their faces.
Mr Rowley is strapped to a stretcher wearing a breathing mask and with breathing apparatus on his chest.
Sam Hobson, a friend of the pair, said he visited them on Saturday and said Mr Rowley was ""in another world"" and ""hallucinating"" after Ms Sturgess was taken away by paramedics.
He told Sky News: ""I came around Charlie's house in the morning and there was loads of ambulances outside and his girlfriend was getting taken away and he said she was complaining of a headache in the morning.
""She went into the bathroom to have a bath and he heard a thump and she was in there having a fit, foam coming out of her mouth.""
He added: ""He [Mr Rowley] was sweating loads dribbling and you couldn't speak to him. He was making funny noises and he was rocking backwards and forwards. There was no response for me, he didn't even know I was there, he was in another world - he was hallucinating.""",news.sky.com,2018-07-04 23:27:00,30,379580

"Rentickle is today among the top five-six rental companies, which offer a range of products on rent to youngsters, who are not keen to invest in buying them
A few years ago when Vineet Chawla went to Kenya, he wanted to rent a DSLR for photography during his holiday. He was unable to procure one on rent and ended up spending ₹1 lakh on buying a Canon. So, when he set up Rentickle, the company that offers furniture and consumer goods on rent, Chawla decided to include cameras in it as well. Rentickle is today among the top five-six rental companies, which offer a range of products on rent to youngsters, who are not keen to invest in buying them. These include furniture such as beds, sofas, dining sets, tables, as well as consumer durables and appliances, including refrigerators, washing machines, air coolers and microwave ovens.
Rentickle is just one among such companies (there’s Fabrento, Furlenco and RentoMojo, among others) that are mushrooming to cater to the needs of young consumers. Rentickle’s Chawla says that it is a booming business, with a handful of strong brands already serving the market. “Consumer awareness about this business is still low and the upside is huge,” he says.
Currently, a majority of Rentickle’s clients are young IT professionals in places such as Gurugram, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Chawla’s target consumer is between 22 and 30 years. He/she is typically someone who is moving cities for work. The company also counts newly married couples among its customers.
Sidhant Lamba, founder of Fabrento, another Delhi-based company in a similar business, agrees: it is the young that are driving this business. The company has a presence in Delhi, Faridabad, Gurugram, Mumbai, Thane, Chandigarh and Mohali. Fabrento is part of the Continental Group, which has been making furniture for the past 50 years.
Clearly, the furniture rental companies are catering to millennials. According to Pew Research, millennials are the people born between 1981 and 1996 (aged 22 to 37 in 2018). Increasingly, marketers are looking for ideas that cater to their needs. An earlier Morgan Stanley report (April 2017) said India will have 410 million millennials, who will spend $330 billion annually, by 2020. That’s more than the population of the US, and more than the number of millennials (400 million) that China has today, said a Mint report.
Fabrento and Rentickle promoters describe their consumer as typically someone who comes to the big city to work. These people do not know how long they will stick to their job. So, they do not want to get stuck with furniture and other stuff as they may be mobile. Interestingly, another report says millennials have a tendency to quit their jobs within two years of joining. In fact, a lot of them also prefer to be part of the gig economy rather than getting stuck with a 9-5 routine. “I am 28. I don’t know whether I will settle in Delhi, Pune or Chicago. This is how the millennials think,” says Chawla.
So they’re getting beds and living room furniture and are happy to pay the monthly rent. Lamba’s average ticket price is between ₹1,600 and ₹2,500 a month, which these youngsters find easy to shell out.
The renting companies say the arrangement suits the youngsters “because when they feel they cannot pay, they merely cancel the subscription. It is not like they are defaulting on an EMI”, explains Lamba.
Marketing experts say the term “millennial” is not an age group, it is a state of mind. And Chawla understands this. “Millennials are clear on what they want. As consumers, they are very smart. They do not want an asset-heavy life.” In an earlier interview to Mint, a 26-year-old woman had admitted that she was in no hurry to buy a house and was sharing a flat with a friend. She had no intention to buy a car either as she was happy to use Ola and Uber to travel. Says Fabrento’s Lamba: “We are living in the times of a shared economy. The times to hoard are over.” Millennials do not want to buy real estate or automobiles as they do not want to get stuck with things. Besides, they may move frequently between cities. They do not want to be tied down to a location.
With changing consumer habits, both Rentickle and Fabrento see a big potential in the renting business. While Rentickle is eyeing Kolkata, Mohali, Kochi and Jaipur in the future, Fabrento is gearing up to launch in Bengaluru. “The millennials’ mindset is to spend on entertainment, gadgets, travel and experiences rather than on assets. They are value-for-money conscious but not tied to assets,” says Chawla.

"LONDON: On a tennis court in London, former British number one Tim Henman is training a somewhat unusual group of candidates to become ball boys and girls for a tournament in December: dogs.
The canines try to catch tennis balls as well as sit still as Henman lists the traits they need to succeed at the tryout to become ""ball dogs"": ""Lightning speed, endless endurance and good concentration"".

The dogs are being trained for the Dec. 6-9 Champions Tennis event held each year at London's Royal Albert Hall with a host of veteran tennis names.
""Fingers crossed they will all be good enough to make the final cut and appear at this year's Champions Tennis event,"" Henman said.
""I'd love to play alongside them in December. The dogs' enthusiasm and desire to fetch would certainly make it even more of a fantastic spectacle and no doubt they'd get more attention than the players.""
""Ball dogs"" are not a novelty in tennis, with them already having appeared on court at the Brazil Open.

Just how to ensure Kylian Mbappe gets a plentiful supply in his efforts to prise open a notoriously stingy Uruguay defence will be France coach Didier Deschamps' main preoccupation before Friday's World Cup quarter-final.
NIZHNY NOVGOROD, Russia: Just how to ensure Kylian Mbappe gets a plentiful supply in his efforts to prise open a notoriously stingy Uruguay defence will be France coach Didier Deschamps' main preoccupation before Friday's World Cup quarter-final.
The teenager is already being compared to Pele as he emerges as the X-factor for the French but will need to be afforded every available opportunity if he is to make an impact in the match at the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium.

The best way to utilise the 19-year-old's incredible pace and finishing acumen - so vividly displayed with two goals in the 4-3 win over Argentina in the round of 16 - has been the subject of much debate in the build-up to the World Cup but certainly a pleasurable problem for the coach.
""I cannot complain that I have players who can take up several offensive positions,"" Deschamps said earlier this year.
""But I can make sure that they are used in their best position.""
While many pundits insist Mbappe is best used in a classic centre forward role, Deschamps is likely to play him on the right of the attack on Friday, making place for Olivier Giroud to join Antoine Griezmann in what will be a trio of forwards.

France will need all the attacking flair they can muster, because breaking down Uruguay will be like a jackhammer trying to tear open a tar road.
The South Americans have kept a clean sheet in six of previous seven games with club mates Diego Godin and Jose Gimenez a veritable wall.
Uruguay's game plan will be familiar. Make it as hard as possible for the opposition and when you get the ball give it to Edinson Cavani or Luis Suarez.
Except, those plans could be severely disrupted if Cavani does not recover from a calf injury and misses out on Friday.
Uruguay did practice earlier this week for the possibility, with Cristhian Stuani likely to be brought into the side in and Cristian Rodriguez asked to offer more support to Suarez, who has tried to play down Cavani's possible absence.
""Things don't depend on just one player. Uruguay have shown we depend on collective work on the pitch,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.

"Turkey's top glass maker Şişecam is planning to invest more in India, where it is considering producing windshields for the country's booming auto industry.
General Manager Ahmet Kırman announced on Monday that the company is also seeking new investment opportunities in Mexico and Europe.
India is one of the most attractive markets in the world in terms of growth potential, Kırman explained in an interview in Istanbul.
""India is a very good market, especially in terms of sheet glass. We plan to rapidly increase our capabilities regarding product diversification, opening new (glass) furnaces... We will be more efficient in India by expanding our product range,"" he said.
He noted that Indian automotive market was also experiencing a very serious growth trend.
""We do not have an automotive glass production there right now. A new factory for automobile glass production is necessary. We will be making an assessment on that as well,"" he added.
Meanwhile, Kırman declined to provide an amount for the planned investments.
He said the company was also looking at opportunities in Mexico but U.S. President Donald Trump's recent protectionist measures had clouded the outlook. ""We have very interesting offers (in Mexico)... But we will see where we could grow smartly and take action accordingly,"" he said.
He noted that they are thinking of a possible investment in Mexico in the glass packaging area.
In March, Trump decided to impose import duties on steel and aluminum, drawing criticism from other countries for heightening the risk of a global trade war. The U.S. tariffs have been imposed on Europe, Canada and Mexico since June 1, after their temporary exemptions expired.
As for their main business areas, Kırman said they were carrying out market research and feasibility studies for automotive glass in India and glass packaging in Mexico.
However, he said, investment decisions in the upcoming period will be determined by the global protectionist policies and the flow of potential trade wars in the world.
India is making more cars than ever as its economy develops and domestic passenger vehicle sales rose by 20 percent in May from last year, data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers shows. Şişecam, the third largest producer of glassware in the world and fifth largest in glass packaging and flat glass, made 4.8 million tons of glass in 2017 at 43 sites in 13 countries. The Istanbul-based company, which competes with NSG Pilkington, Asahi Glass Co, Saint Gobain and Guardian Glass in float glass production, has grown in India through acquisitions in recent months.
Its Trakya Cam subsidiary produces float glass, which and mirrors at a 600 ton per day capacity plant in India and last month it bought 49.8 percent of India's HNG Float Glass, where it was a 50 percent shareholder, for $85.4 million.
Şişecam also expanded in Europe and became Italy's second largest producer of float glass when it bought a factory from Italy's Sangalli for 15.7 million euros ($18.32 million).
When asked whether or not they think of new investment in Italy, Kırman said they will most probably plan it.
""We can plan a development in terms of a factory in the north, we are t
hinking about it,"" he said.
He noted that they were also assessing investment opportunities in other European countries, indicating that investing in Western European countries does not seem very attractive because of high costs.
Kirman said Şişecam was also looking to invest in start-ups in Turkey and abroad to diversify from its core business.",www.dailysabah.com,2018-07-04 23:25:24,27,198106
"Low-cost carrier AirAsia India is offering tickets for as low as ₹1,299 on key routes connecting key cities such as New Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Jaipur and Chennai.
Mumbai: Airlines are offering flash sales and discounted ticket prices during the traditionally lean monsoon season, despite rising oil prices and the falling rupee as they hope to attract more passengers and make as many advance bookings as possible to feed the capacity that has been added by them in the past couple of months.
The Ajay Singh-led no-frills carrier, SpiceJet, on Wednesday said it would offer tickets on domestic routes starting at ₹999 for bookings made between 4 July and 8 July for travel between July and October. Low-cost carrier AirAsia India is offering tickets for as low as ₹1,299 on key routes connecting key cities such as New Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Jaipur and Chennai. The airline is also offering international travel to Kaula Lampur from cities such as Bhubaneswar, Chennai and Hyderabad at fares as low as ₹3,999 and to international destinations such as Bangkok, Phuket, Pattaya and Krabi at ₹4,299.
“As the demand has dropped during the lean monsoon season, airlines are incentivizing people to travel during the season by offering discounts,” said Sharat Dhall, chief operating officer (B2C) of travel portal Yatra.com.
“Despite the rise in fuel prices and fall in rupee (against the dollar), ticket prices this quarter are similar to the same quarter of the previous year,” Dhall said. This, he added, is because of the capacity additions made by Indian airlines.
Indian airlines have added several new planes and leased aircraft to their fleet this year to take advantage of the growth the market has to offer. With about 170 planes in its fleet, market leader IndiGo is preparing to add another 400 or so aircraft, including A320s and ATRs, to its fleet during the next seven-eight years.
SpiceJet would add 107 B737-800s and 50 Bombardier Q400s during the 2018-2023 period. Budget carrier, GoAir, which is yet to take off on overseas routes, would induct 119 A320 aircraft during the period 2018-2022, while AirAsia India would induct 60 planes in the next five years.
India’s largest airline by market share, IndiGo, last week offered fares as low as ₹1,200 for domestic bookings till the end of June.
While Jet Airways had slashed domestic fares by up to 25% and international ticket prices by up to 30%. Wadia Group-owned no-frills airline GoAir too offered domestic fares as low as ₹1,199 during a flash sale last week.
“In comparison to 2017, we have observed a spike in bookings to all of these (popular holiday) destinations. This can be attributed to the fact that most airlines are tapping the increase in demand because of the holiday season, by using big discounts and offers to attract travellers,” said Aloke Bajpai, chief executive and co-founder of online travel portal Ixigo.
One of the fastest growing aviation markets, the domestic passenger demand in India is the highest among the major aviation markets, according to the International Air Transport Association. The Indian domestic market grew at 22.9% during the January-March 2018 period, as compared to that of the previous year",www.livemint.com,2018-07-04 23:25:03,19,159023
"Turkey has taken another important step to improve its economic relations with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). The Turkish Union of Chambers of Commerce (TOBB) and the Turkish Cypriot Chamber of Commerce (KTTO) signed a protocol on Tuesday to establish the Turkey-TRNC Chamber of Commerce Forum.
The protocol to establish the joint forum was signed by TOBB President Rıfat Hisarcıklıoğlu and KKTO President Turgay Deniz after the Turkey-TRNC Economic Affairs meeting in Lefkoşa.
The joint chamber of commerce forum aims to improve dialogue on commercial and economic issues of common interest.
Delivering a speech during the meeting, TOBB President Hisarcıklıoğlu said the Turkish business world as always would continue to stand by Turkish Cypriots.
""Economy, trade, tourism, education and investment are of course very important, but our brotherly ties are more important, and you are our brothers and our partners in every area,"" he said. He also noted that they recognize the potential that would strengthen the economic ties between the two countries, adding that the Turkish business world wants Turkish Cypriots to become wealthier and that they were well aware of the unfair isolation that is slowing it down.
The island of Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when a Greek Cypriot coup took place after decades of violence against the island's Turkish community and Ankara's intervention as a guarantor power.

"England ends penalty jinx
2 SHARES Share Tweet
MOSCOW (AFP) – England held its nerve against Colombia to win its first ever penalty shootout in a World Cup and reach the quarterfinals in dramatic fashion on Tuesday.
Eric Dier scored the decisive spot-kick to win the shootout 4-3 and send Gareth Southgate’s young team through to a meeting with Sweden, who earlier beat Switzerland, 1-0.
A bad-tempered match at Moscow’s Spartak Stadium that featured eight yellow cards – six for Colombian players – ended 1-1 after 30 tense minutes of extra-time, meaning the game had to be decided by penalties.
The South American side, without injured forward James Rodriguez, appeared on the edge of reaching their second consecutive World Cup quarterfinal when Jordan Henderson’s effort was saved by Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina, keeping the score at 3-2.
But Mateus Uribe then rattled the crossbar and after Kieran Trippier levelled at 3-3, England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford saved from Carlos Bacca, extending his left arm to stop the ball as he dived to his right.
That gave England match point and Eric Dier made no mistake, beating the despairing dive of Ospina before he was mobbed by his teammates.
It is the first time England have won a shootout at a World Cup – and comes after six failures in seven attempts at major tournaments before Russia.
Southgate’s team were minutes away from victory during normal time but Yerry Mina rose to head home an equaliser from a corner and cancel out captain Harry Kane’s 57th-minute penalty.
The late, late goal deflated England and the momentum shifted visibly towards the South Americans, who started extra-time with a spring in their step.
GIVES US BELIEF
England, for so long under-achievers on the international stage, are the only former winners left in the bottom half of the draw and, with Sweden up next, will fancy their chances of reaching the semi-finals for just the third time in their history.
Pickford is the first England goalkeeper to save a penalty in a shootout at a major tournament since David Seaman at the 1998 World Cup against Argentina.
“It gives us belief to go into the Sweden game.”
Kane’s penalty in the first half made him the tournament’s top scorer with six goals, two clear of Belgium’s Romelu Lukaku.
With Spain already ejected, England faceS Sweden in Samara on Saturday, with Russia and Croatia potential semifinal opponents.
Brazil and France lurk in the top half of the draw but Lionel Messi’s Argentina and Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal are out.
Even Prince William got caught up in the emotion, tweeting: “I couldn’t be prouder of @England – a victory in a penalty shootout! You have well and truly earned your place in the final eight of the #worldcup.’’
FORSBERG SHINES
In the early game on Tuesday, RB Leipzig striker Emil Forsberg’s deflected 66th-minute shot took Sweden through to their first World Cup quarterfinal since 1994, with the Swiss unable to respond in Saint Petersburg.

Four men allegedly raped a 19-year-old woman, who was lured on the pretext of being provided a job, in a forest here, police said today.
A man and a woman, who had called the victim to Dewas promising her a job, were arrested, Kotwali police station in-charge M S Parmar said.
The victim, who hailed from Khargone district, reached Dewas on Monday around 9.30 pm and called the accused woman who sent Manoj alias Sunny Gurjar to pick her up, he said.
However, Gurjar drove the victim, on his motorcycle, to a deserted place outside the city where three men joined him, he said.
The four accused tied the victim to a tree and allegedly raped her. On seeing flashlights of a vehicle in the area, the accused fled the spot leaving the victim there, Mr Parmar said.
He said the victim somehow managed to untie herself and after asking for help from passersby, she reached the police station and filed a complaint against the accused.
The police filed an FIR yesterday against the four men and the woman under relevant IPC sections, he said.
Gurjar and Shruti alias Rashmi were subsequently arrested while a search was on for the other three accused, Mr Parmar said.

"Recent test shots of the Teber Laser Guidance Kit developed in national facilities were successful. The system's delivery to the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) begins this month.
Developed by one of the leading Turkish defense contractors, ROKETSAN, and attached to MK-81 (250lb) and MK-82 (500lb) general-purpose bombs, the Teber Guidance Kit converts bombs into precision smart weapons.
Test shots were conducted in Karapınar, Konya, on June 21-22 with Mk-82 bombs fitted with the Teber Guidance Kit, consisting of a laser seeker, guiding kit - inertial navigation unit, global positioning system, missile computer - and a tail kit system.
In the tests, while the jet was climbing 30 degrees, moving target and live warhead shots were successful, resulting in effective hits.
The delivery of the Teber Guidance Kit, which has successfully completed its integration into F-16 jets and certification activities, begins this month. Afterwards, ammunition with the Teber Guidance Kit can be used in operations by attaching to the F-16 platform.
Thus, ammunition manufactured in domestic and national facilities will replace ammunition previously supplied from abroad.
The Teber can be integrated into the bomb very quickly by the user in the field.
Body Strakes mounted on the bombshell supply additional lift and stability and increase weapon maneuver capability.
The Teber's modular design offers affordable and innovative options. An add-on Laser Seeker located on the front section allows precise hit capability for moving targets. The Laser Seeker may be equipped with or without an approximate censor.
The Teber tail section can identify bombs it is integrated onto, providing a logistics advantage for the user.",www.dailysabah.com,2018-07-04 23:24:37,14,198017
"Caroline Wozniacki suffered fresh Wimbledon woe as the world number two suffered a shock 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 defeat against Ekaterina Makarova in the second round on Wednesday. Wozniacki, plagued by an invasion of flying ants during the Court One clash, saved five match points but has now failed to get past the last 16 in 12 visits to the All England Club. It was a bitter defeat for the 27-year-old Dane, who was expected to challenge for the Wimbledon title after winning her maiden Grand Slam crown at the Australian Open in January. Wozniacki's frustration was only increased by the unwanted infestation that landed at Wimbledon during her match.
With flying ants stuck in Wozniacki's hair and dive-bombing her throughout the match, the former world number one asked the umpire if there was something that could be sprayed to keep the bugs away.
""They're in my mouth and in my hair and everywhere -- we need to do something. Is there a spray?"" she said.
""I want to be here to focus on tennis, not eating bugs.""
Wozniacki arrived in south-west London in good form on grass following her victory at the Wimbledon warm-up event in Eastbourne last week.
But once again she exits Wimbledon in embarrassing style, leaving the grass-court Grand Slam as the only one of the four majors at which she has never reached the quarter-finals.
Russian world number 35 Makarova faces Czech world number 66 Lucie Safarova in the third round.
""I couldn't win with a lot of match points, but I kept fighting and playing an aggressive game and finally it worked,"" Makarova said.
""I was really nervous, because you need to win this point.
""When it was 5-5 I started thinking about those match points on my serve at 40-0.
""But I told myself 'no, you are not going to lose this match'. I forgot it and started over.""
Makarova, who had lost seven of her previous eight meetings with Wozniacki, is hoping to emulate her run to the Wimbledon quarter-finals four years ago.

"The Fourth of July is a good day to meet your friends and family for a barbecue party or a cookout. But, nothing ruins a Fourth of July cookout like food poisoning.
According to CDC, each year 76 million people get sick, more than 300,000 are hospitalised, and 5,000 die as a result of foodborne illnesses.
You know that a salad sitting out all day in the sun is not good to eat, but what about that meat burger or a hot dog left on the barbecue grill for a few hours?
Nope, not a good option either!
Food experts say how it is very easy to ruin a cookout. So, follow these simple measures and enjoy your Fourth of July weekend.
Wash your hands - that's important!
More than 70 percent of foodborne infections are due to improper hand washing. Make sure you wash your hands with soap before you cook or handle any food items to avoid contamination. Especially if you touch any raw meat, poultry or eggs, washing your hands before touching food is very important. Bacteria like E coli, listeria, salmonella spread easily from raw meat.
It is very common to forget to wash your hands before eating especially when you are at a party. Be doubly sure to head into the house and wash your hands for a good 20 seconds with soap.
Wash and store your food - that's important too!
Planning to make an awesome salad with potatoes for your guests? Want to keep your veggies cut and ready to cook for an evening party? Keep all the produce properly cut and refrigerated right away. Keeping it out for many hours after cutting is not safe. Fruits, berries, and melons should be thrown away if kept out after cutting for more than two hours.
Always wash your vegetables in running water before cooking. Do not use any harsh detergents or soap to wash veggies. Scrub firmly with a clean washing brush, throw away any damaged veggies before cutting.
Bruised fruits are the breeding ground for bacteria. If you are pregnant you need to be extra careful before eating any raw salad and sprouts. So, proper washing and storing your produce won't hurt.
Make sure to keep your food hot
If you are thinking of burger or hot dogs on the menu, make sure you keep them hot and maintain the right temperature. According to USDA, bacteria can grow rapidly in temperatures between 40F and 140F and double up in twenty minutes.
Don't let your guests make a face when they find the food is not very hot. If you are planning to use the leftovers - reheat them properly, especially if it is steak, meat, or burgers.
Bacteria love cold food too. Reheating insufficiently or cooled too slowly will end up in foodborne illness.
A thermometer will come handy
Using a meat thermometer while cooking is very essential to measure the temperature and check if they are cooked through. Undercooked food is one of the reasons for food poisoning. When you are cooking meat, seafood, or poultry, it should be cooked to the recommended internal temperature. Make sure the food that you eat in the cookout party is cooked through and say no to undercooked meat.
Just colour and texture of the meat is not enough to say if it is cooked well through or not. A thermometer is an accurate way to say if you have reached the safe internal temperature. Always stick to CDC recommended cooking temperature to avoid any bacterial contamination.
Well, when you adhere to some rules before partying, you can keep the foodborne illness at bay!",www.ibtimes.co.in,2018-07-04 23:23:14,40,624638
"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) approved an up to 500 million euro loan yesterday for the construction of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), the bank said in a statement.
The 878-kilometer pipeline will start at the Turkish-Greek border, cross Albania and, after passing under the Adriatic Sea, end in southern Italy. It constitutes the final leg of the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC) and will transport gas from the Caspian region to Europe.
The 4.5 billion euro TAP project is the final leg of the $40 billion SGC set to transport gas from central Asia to Western Europe by 2020.
""With an initial annual capacity of 10 billion cubic meters - equivalent to the energy consumption of approximately 7 million households in Europe - the pipeline will make a significant contribution to the diversification of Europe's energy supply,"" the statement read.
The European investment bank's board earlier this year approved TAP's eligibility for a 1.5 billion euro loan, and further contributions from the export credit agencies of France, Germany and Italy are currently under consideration, the statement added. At the start point in Turkey, TAP will connect to the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP), for which the EBRD approved a 500 million euro loan last October. At the endpoint in Italy, TAP will connect to the Italian natural gas network and from there with wider European networks. The bank said the SGC value chain has a total estimated cost of $40 billion and includes gas infrastructure investments in a 3,500-kilometer network of pipelines crossing six countries. ""The key components are the Shah Deniz offshore gas field in Azerbaijan, the Southern Caucasus Pipeline in Azerbaijan and Georgia, TANAP in Turkey and TAP,"" it added.

""He's going to be a good leader,"" Winnipeg coach Waqar Younis was quoted as saying by BBC. ""He's a team man. He's up front and he likes to give whatever his knowledge is. He's always there."" Previously, Warner has skippered the Australian T20I team and Indian Premier League side Sunrisers Hyderabad. The dashing southpaw helped Sunrisers win the 2016 edition of the IPL.

David along with former Australian skipper Steve Smith returned to competitive cricket after a gap of three months.
29-year-old Smith eased his way back by scoring 61 off 41 balls for the Toronto Nationals in a six-wicket victory over the Vancouver Knights at King City last week while Warner got out cheaply for one run in his comeback match against Montreal Tigers.
Steve Smith and David Warner were banned for 12 months while 25-year-old Cameron Bancroft was slapped with a 9-month ban by Cricket Australia in March for their involvement in ball-tampering controversy during the Cape Town Test against South Africa.

"Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar. (PTI)
Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar today termed the Centre’s decision to increase the MSP for kharif crops a “historic step”, while state Agriculture Minister O P Dhankar said a major recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission has been implemented.
Addressing a group of farmers at his official residence here, Khattar said the BJP government at the Centre has fulfilled its promise of hiking the minimum support price to 1.5 times the production cost of farmers.
Dhankar had accompanied the farmers to the chief minister’s residence.
While dancing to the beats of drums at his residence, Dhankar hailed the MSP hike as historic.
The chief minister said, “The decision taken by the Union Cabinet will help boost farmers’ income, mitigate rural distress and administer the farm sector a booster dose. It is for the first time since Independence that such massive hike in MSP has been effected by any government.”
Khattar said while several recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission’s report had already been implemented, its key recommendation to give farmers 50 per cent more rate than their cost of production too has been fulfilled now.
“Today is a golden day for farmers,” Khattar said.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) at its meeting today approved the MSP of 14 Kharif (summer-sown) crops. MSP for paddy was hiked by a steep Rs 200 per quintal.
Dhankar said, “What is more satisfying is that now a formula has been adopted as per which farmers will get at least 50 per cent more rate than their cost of production.”
“With this decision, the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission have been fully implemented. This decision is historic. It will come as a big boost for farmers,” he told here.
Haryana’s main opposition INLD’s state president Ashok Arora, however, condemned the “meagre increase” of the MSP and termed it “betrayal of the farmers”",www.financialexpress.com,2018-07-04 23:22:14,14,245241

"DAMASCUS (Sputnik) - Members of illegal militant groups in the city of Busra al-Sham (Bosra) in the southern Syrian Daraa province have started surrendering heavy weapons and hardware to the government forces, a military source told Sputnik on Wednesday.
""Thanks to the efforts of Russian officers, which were mediating the talks between militants in Bosra [officially known as Busra al-Sham] and the Syrian army, the militants today handed over a tank, an infantry fighting vehicle and an artillery gun to the government. Before that, they handed over two other IFVs,"" the source said.
Busra al-Sham is one of the most strategically important strongholds of militants in the south of Syria. The city is located between the capitals of Daraa and Suwayda provinces, some 12 miles from the border with Jordan.

On Tuesday, the Russian center for Syrian reconciliation said that, over the week, 27 Syrian settlements had voluntarily joined the ceasefire regime in the provinces of Quneitra, As-Suwayda and Daraa.
The situation in the south of Syria has escalated in recent weeks, with terrorists shelling the cities of Daraa and Suwayda and government troops responding by launching an offensive to oust the militants refusing to join the ceasefire.
Moscow has been assisting Damascus both through supporting the struggle against terrorist groups and providing humanitarian aid to the residents of the crisis-torn country.",sputniknews.com,2018-07-04 23:21:00,8,128396

Belgium's quarter-final battle with Brazil will be a classic encounter between an unstoppable force and an immovable object when the tournament's joint best defence comes up against its most free-scoring attack in Kazan on Friday.
SOCHI, Russia: Belgium's quarter-final battle with Brazil will be a classic encounter between an unstoppable force and an immovable object when the tournament's joint best defence comes up against its most free-scoring attack in Kazan on Friday.
Brazil have conceded only one goal in this World Cup, the equal most stingy rearguard along with Uruguay, and allowed only five shots on target in four games, the fewest of any side.

Belgium, meanwhile, are the tournament's top scorers, banging in 12 goals in their four games so far.
Eight of those goals came against Tunisia and Panama, and slim wins against England and Japan have cast some doubt on whether they can impose themselves against better teams.
The much-lauded midfield struggled in the Round of 16 tie against a Japan side who never gave them time on the ball and it was only when Marouane Fellaini came on in the second half to provide some muscle that Belgium took control of the contest.
The Belgians may want to adopt that more robust approach from the start against Brazil in order to give midfield maestros Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne time to make decisive passes.

""We will need power,"" Belgium's coach Roberto Martinez said in what could be a hint towards his intentions. ""We have to defend as well as we can and then cause them pain when we have the ball.""
Brazil will likely start with Fernandinho in place of the suspended Casemiro, a change that gives them their own added muscle, but the South Americans could miss the Real Madrid midfielder's drive going forward.
The match, however, may be won at the other end of the field.
Belgium's three central defenders are all imposing figures but two of them, Vincent Kompany and Jan Vertonghen, are the wrong side of 30.
With Kompany still finding his feet after his latest period out through injury, Brazil's swarming attacks could prove productive against the ageing Belgian backline.
On the flanks, Willian and Philippe Coutinho can stretch defences, and fire in shots and crosses, while Neymar and Gabriel Jesus can also pull defences apart from more central positions.
Belgium will need their wing backs to be operating at full tilt if they are to get back and assist.
Marcelo is fit again for Brazil and could return in place of Filipe Luis at left back, while winger Douglas Costa is back from injury and will be on the bench.

"Iran will help shed light on the case of one of its Vienna-based diplomats who was arrested in Germany over a suspected plot to carry out a bomb attack on an exiled Iranian opposition group, Austria said on Wednesday.
VIENNA: Iran will help shed light on the case of one of its Vienna-based diplomats who was arrested in Germany over a suspected plot to carry out a bomb attack on an exiled Iranian opposition group, Austria said on Wednesday.
The case cast a shadow over Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's visit to Austria on Wednesday at which both sides discussed issues including salvaging the Iran nuclear deal after the U.S. decision to withdraw and reinstate sanctions on Tehran.

""We expect full clarification in connection with this and I thank you, Mr President, for assuring us that you will support this clarification,"" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a statement to reporters after meeting Rouhani.
Rouhani did not mention the diplomat in his remarks and the two leaders took no questions.
Austria summoned Iran's ambassador over the case on Monday and said it was stripping the arrested Iranian of his diplomatic status.
Belgian authorities identified the diplomat as 46-year-old Assadollah A and said he is suspected of having been in contact with two people arrested in Belgium with 500 grams of the homemade explosive TATP and a detonation device in their car.

Their alleged target was a rally near Paris last weekend of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) - an umbrella organisation of opposition groups in exile that seek an end to Shi'ite Muslim clerical rule in Iran.
Belgium also issued a European arrest warrant for a man of Iranian origin being held in France suspected of being involved in the alleged plot, a French judicial source said.
U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani as well as former European and Arab ministers attended the NCRI meeting.
The NCRI held a small protest against Rouhani's visit on the edge of the area of central Vienna that police sealed off.
Foreign ministers from the remaining signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal - Iran, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China - meet in Vienna on Friday to discuss salvaging the accord.
European powers are putting together an economic package aimed at safeguarding the deal by shielding Iran from some of the impact of U.S. sanctions resuming. Rouhani has said Iran will stay in the accord if its interests are preserved.
An Iranian official said Rouhani was also due to meet the head of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is policing the restrictions the deal places on Iran's atomic activities in exchange for sanctions relief.
Rouhani's one-day visit to Austria followed a longer trip that was planned two years ago but which he cancelled at the last minute on unspecified security grounds.

"India's government says it has asked WhatsApp to take ""immediate action"" to prevent the social media platform from being misused to spread rumors and irresponsible statements like those blamed for recent deadly mob attacks in the country. At least 20 people have been killed in mostly rural villages in several Indian states in attacks by mobs that had been inflamed by social media. Victims were accused in the viral messages of belonging to gangs trying to abduct children. The brutal attacks, which began in early May, have also left dozens of people injured. Although Indian authorities have clarified that there was no truth to the rumors and the targeted people were innocent, the deadly and brutal attacks, often captured on cellphones and shared on social media, have spread across the country.
India's ministry of electronics and information technology said in a statement late Tuesday that the lynchings were tied to ""irresponsible and explosive messages"" circulated on WhatsApp. It wasn't specific on the preventative measures it expected to be taken by WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook. WhatsApp said in a blog post that it would institute awards for research on ""spread of misinformation"" on its platform. The Indian Express, an English-language daily newspaper, quoted a WhatsApp spokesman as saying, ""The situation is a public health problem which will require solutions from outside the company as well, including the government.""
The official said that the ""responsibility is beyond any one technology company"" and ""requires partners,"" according to the paper. ""I think it's up to the Indian government to decide what is the right mechanism to address the spate of killing that is occurring. It is going to have to be a collaboration,"" the official said.",www.dailysabah.com,2018-07-04 23:20:12,12,197851
"Inderjeet Singh was provisionally suspended on July 26, 2016. (Source: Express file photo) Inderjeet Singh was provisionally suspended on July 26, 2016. (Source: Express file photo)
Shot putter Inderjeet Singh has been banned for four years for testing positive for anabolic steroids but the anti-doping disciplinary panel pulled up the National Anti-Doping Agency and the National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) for departures from standard protocol with regard to collection and analysis of samples.
“In respect of testing and analysis of samples, we are in agreement of submission give by the athlete,” the panel headed by chairman Manik Dogra said. “The purpose of having established procedures is to safeguard the integrity of the procedures as a whole, be it an issue of chain of custody, rectification/calibration of testing machines, any serious deviation in the process does raise uncomfortable questions on the quality of the testing process and the authenticity of its findings and results. The validity of transparency of the adverse analytical finding must be in our view beyond reproach,” the panel stated in its order.
Among issues the athlete raised through his lawyer Anish Dayal was the fact that the doping control officer (DCO) took the sample home and stored it in a regular refrigerator before taking it to the NADA office when it should have been handed over to the laboratory. Moreover, the athlete’s lawyer argued that there was no mention in the chain of custody form on how the DCO secured the ‘integrity’ and ‘identity’ of the samples during a 15-hour time lag in extreme temperature from the athlete’s home in Bhiwani to New Delhi. The fact that there were discrepancies in the volume when the sample was collected and sealed and when it reached the laboratory was also brought to the notice of the panel.
Inderjeet was one of the first athletes to qualify for the Rio Games, but was provisionally suspended on July 26, 2016 after he tested positive for banned substances — androsterone and etiocholanolone.
The three-member panel concluded that he has violated article 2.1 of anti-doping code. The panel, however, admitted that NADA and NDTL didn’t follow well known and established procedures. “We unfortunately conclude that there were departures in the analysis and collection of samples. We note neither NADA nor NDTL have owned up to the departures and forcefully contested these allegations. Without going into specifics of each deviation, we do not agree with submission of NADA. The procedure clearly deviated from WADA guidelines,” the panel stated.

"Police talk to a woman who climbed to the base of the Statue of Liberty in New York on July 4, 2018
The Statue of Liberty, a powerful symbol of US freedom and long a beacon to immigrants, was shut down Wednesday on Independence Day as a woman refused to leave its base in a lengthy standoff with police.
New York police said they were assisting US Park Police to remove the woman from the monument.

But Rise and Resist NYC, which organized the protest, said the woman was not affiliated with the group.

The Chelsea attacker has been a mainstay in Tite's starting line-up so far in the tournament and is set for a fifth consecutive start against Belgium in the quarter-finals on Friday.
Despite his impressive performances on the international stage, it is his club future that has come under the microscope in recent days.
Willian insists talk over a move to Barcelona will not distract him from Brazil's World Cup
Chelsea turned down a £50million offer from Barcelona for Willian last week. Despite winning the league and cup double last season, the Catalan giants have concerns that their squad still lacks greater quality in depth and attacking flair.
The Spanish side see the skillful 29-year-old as a playmaker who can add an extra dimension to their attack following the departure of Andres Iniesta and want him to link up with compatriot Philippe Coutinho.
When asked about linking up with Coutinho and Paulinho at the Nou Camp, Willian said: 'Well, they are excellent players with a lot of quality. In addition to great players, they are very good friends.
'People speculate a lot. We see a lot of things on the internet, but this is not the time to talk about this. I've not received any information about that. I'm trying to focus on my performance, playing for Brazil.'

Cavani hit a brace in Uruguay's last-16 success over Portugal but his evening ended early as he was substituted with a hamstring problem.

'I had the same kind of injury and it took time, I tried to defy medical science, and it wasn't easy. So if he plays against us, he'll have destroyed science, so stop making us believe that he'll play against us.'
Cavani has three goals at the World Cup so far and has been a hugely important figure in Uruguay's progression to the last eight.

Real Madrid has denied reaching an agreement to sign France forward Kylian Mbappe from Paris Saint-Germain. The Spanish club released a statement Wednesday calling reports of an agreement between Madrid and PSG “completely false.”
Madrid says it “has not made any offer to PSG or the player and condemns the spreading of this type of information that has not been proven by the parties concerned.”
The denial comes two days after Madrid dismissed a report that it had offered to buy Neymar from PSG for a world record transfer of 310 million euros ($360 million). It said the report by Spanish public broadcaster TVE was “absolutely untrue.”
PSG is under pressure from UEFA to raise cash from selling players. The French club needs to comply with “Financial Fair Play” rules which monitor overspending on transfers and wages. PSG spent a record 222 million euros ($260 million) last year to buy Neymar from Barcelona.
UEFA warned the French champions three weeks ago they will “remain under close scrutiny” when they submit accounts for the financial year, which ended last Saturday.

"HC prohibited the authorities from cutting down or taking away trees till July 26, next date of hearing on plea against felling of trees.
Court asked why everyone needs to be given space in the Lutyens' Delhi when the peripherals of the national capital have so much of vacant land, and added 'the mantra is decongestion'. (Photo: File | PTI)
New Delhi: How could a sapling replace a grown-up tree, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked while observing that felling over 16,500 trees to build multi-storey accommodation for proposed redevelopment of six South Delhi colonies was akin to leaving the city to die.
The high court prohibited the authorities from cutting down or taking away trees till July 26, the next date of hearing on a plea against felling of trees for housing projects and asked whether any environment impact assessment was carried out before initiating the work.
""If Delhi needs that they (buildings) be dismantled, they will be dismantled. You can't leave the city to die like this,"" a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said.
It also asked why everyone needs to be given space in the Lutyens' Delhi when the peripherals of the national capital have so much of vacant land, and added ""the mantra is decongestion"".
The court said the authorities should develop colonies like Narela. Taking note of a submission that Delhi was running out of ground water, the court asked the Centre and the city government how they propose to water the saplings which are going to replace fully grown trees under the compensatory afforestation policy.
""Delhi government shall explain how a fully grown tree could be equated with 10 saplings? How long a sapling will take to grow as a tree. Delhi was earlier known for its bird population,"" the bench said. It also questioned the Centre on its redevelopment scheme, asking how permission was given to change a two-storeyed building, meant for two families, into an eight-storeyed building.
""What do you mean by redevelopment. This is your scheme. Replacing a two-storeyed building with an eight-floor building, this is what you call redevelopment,"" the bench said. ""From where do you get water for such eight-floor buildings? What amount of garbage will be generated? Where is parking and what about air pollution? You don't apply you mind to planning,"" the bench said.
The counsel, appearing for the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC), tasked with redeveloping half a dozen south Delhi colonies, claimed that no garbage was going out of the construction site.
The court was also of the opinion that the construction was an impediment for ambulances and patients in reaching the two super speciality hospitals -- AIIMS and Safdarjung -- in the area.
""There will be traffic jam at the main gate of the colonies. Two major hospitals are at the intersection. How will people reach AIIMS and Safdarjung hospital? You must have done an Environment Impact Assessment. Show it to us,"" it said.
It also sought to know the density of the area and said that after laying infrastructure including road, water, electricity, garbage system, macro-level planning is done.
""How can you amend the master plan retrospectively after developing a colony,"" the bench said. The court asked the DDA to place before it all the schemes of redevelopment. It said why everyone needs to be given space in the Lutyens' Delhi when the peripherals of Delhi have so much of vacant land and added ""the mantra is decongestion"".
The court granted time to Ministries of Environment and Forest and Housing, the Delhi government, NBCC, DDA, Delhi Jal Board, NDMC and other authorities to file their response on the petition which has sought setting aside of the terms of reference (ToR) and Environmental Clearance (EC) granted to the housing project by the Environment Ministry, claiming it would lead to felling of over 16,500 trees.
The bench also sought details as to how much space has been given for commercial activities. The court said there was a need for the presence of experts related to these issues and appointed environmentalist MC Mehta as amicus curiae in the matter. Delhi government standing counsel told the court that the government has started the process of revoking and reviewing the permission granted to cut trees for the projects. The court was hearing a PIL by orthopaedic surgeon Dr Kaushal Kant Mishra against felling of trees for housing projects in six south Delhi colonies -- Sarojini Nagar, Naoroji Nagar, Netaji Nagar, Thyagaraja Nagar, Mohammadpur and Kasturba Nagar. A similar issue is also pending before the National Green Tribunal (NGT).
The petition has claimed that planting of saplings in another location as compensatory afforestation would not reduce the burden which would be put on the environment due to the large-scale felling of trees.
It has claimed that saplings would be a ""poor substitute"" for the fully grown trees that would be felled for the housing projects.
The court also sought response of the authorities on a contempt plea filed by environmentalist Vimlendu Jha alleging that there was deliberate and wilful default of June 25 undertaking given to the court by the NBCC not to cut trees till July 4 for housing projects in New Delhi.",www.asianage.com,2018-07-04 23:15:00,40,236519

New Delhi: The union government’s common services centres (CSCs) across the country will operate as business correspondents (BCs) of HDFC Bank. An agreement between the two aims to create last-mile access points for financial services across the country.
There are approximately 300,000 CSCs in the country—access points with basic computing infrastructure run and operated by a local entrepreneur who lives in the same community.
It is an integral part of the ‘Digital India’ initiative of the government to foster financial inclusion in the country.
A business correspondent is an approved bank agent providing basic banking service using a micro-ATM.
“This agreement is expected to be a game changer as it would significantly contribute to government’s objectives of enabling Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of various schemes,” said a statement from the union IT ministry.
Women, senior citizens and persons with disability are expected to benefit significantly through this initiative. This will facilitate withdrawal and deposit of government entitlements such as payments under MGNREGA as well as various social welfare schemes like widow pension, handicapped and old age pension, etc, the statement added.

"With its dystopian story of racial exploitation behind the veneer of modern America, ""Sorry to Bother You,"" the first movie by the rapper Boots Riley, is showing the fresh vitality in African American cinema.
The movie, which hits US theaters on Friday, comes a year after the runaway success of ""Get Out,"" the first feature film by Jordan Peele about a town of wealthy white people who conspire to implant themselves into African American bodies. ""Sorry to Bother You,"" also made on a small budget, marks a new outlet for the militant voice of Riley, best known as the frontman of The Coup, the politically engaged and critically praised hip-hop group. With echoes of science-fiction classic ""Metropolis,"" the film focuses on exploitation at a telemarketing firm, whose workers are crammed into the basement as executives work on floors above them in vast rooms bathed in light.
Separating them is an elevator, which becomes the setting for several comical scenes. The hero Cassius - played by Lakeith Stanfield, who also starred in ""Get Out"" - can only ascend in the elevator, and the symbolic social ladder, as he switches into a ""white voice.""
New settings for race
Much like ""Get Out,"" set in a placid town where the villain is said to have voted for Barack Obama, ""Sorry to Bother You"" shines a light not on police brutality or other more obvious issues in Donald Trump's America but instead looks at racism in ostensibly safe confines. In ""Sorry to Bother You,"" the CEO of fictitious corporation WorryFree reflects the worst traits of a Silicon Valley executive, a visionary who dreams of uber-workers who are half-human, half-horse.
Riley - the son of Chicago labor activists who has spent his life on the fringes of Silicon Valley in Oakland, California - searched for several years to find an audience for his screenplay. He first turned ""Sorry to Bother You"" into a 2012 album by The Coup which merged rap delivery with live orchestration.
The 47-year-old first-time director said it was an uphill battle to be taken seriously in film. It's ""as difficult as it would be if your favorite saxophone player said he wanted to build your house. You are a musician with a script -- who wants to read that?"" he told Agence France-Presse (AFP).
The film pays tribute to several social movements of recent years including Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street, in which Riley was active.
It is too early to tell if ""Sorry to Bother You,"" which won acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival in January, will see the same success as ""Get Out"" - let alone ""Black Panther,"" the much-larger budget film from Marvel about an African super-hero that has quickly become one of the highest-grossing movies of all time.
But cast members are saluting the rise of such films as proof that, some 30 years after the breakthrough of Spike Lee's racial drama ""Do the Right Thing,"" African American cinema is dynamic, original and nuanced.
Tessa Thompson, who plays Cassius' girlfriend Detroit in ""Sorry to Bother You,"" voiced hope that more movies would follow, saying that black cinema's problem had never been a lack of talent.
""It really has to do with a lack of opportunity and a perceived lack of an audience. What you see with 'Get Out' is that there is an audience for it - and the audience, by the way, is not just black,"" said Thompson, whose previous films have included 2014's historical saga ""Selma"" and last year's action flick ""Thor: Ragnarok.""
Stanfield said that African American films were showing they can be ""imaginative and crazy"" - and also simply fun.
""You don't have to come see us talk about our place in America and cry all the time,"" he said. ""You can leave the theater feeling hopeful, like this film makes me feel, and still talk about the deep things that affect us every day.""",www.dailysabah.com,2018-07-04 23:13:28,23,197999

"A couple are fighting for their lives in hospital after being exposed to remnants of the nerve agent that nearly killed a former Russian spy and his daughter.
Dawn Sturgess, 44, and Charles Rowley, 45, fell desperately ill within hours of visiting Salisbury – the site of the attempted assassination of Sergei and Yulia Skripal.
Police confirmed they were exposed to Novichok, which is one of the most toxic substances known to man - even a pinprick can kill.
They visited a park near where the Skripals were found collapsed in March and Ms Sturgess lives 300 yards from where Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia ate on the day they were poisoned four months ago.
Dawn Sturgess, 44, and Charles Rowley, 45, are fighting for their lives in hospital after being exposed to remnants of the nerve agent that nearly killed a former Russian spy and his daughter
The couple are thought to have stumbled across a discarded container or syringe used to carry the nerve agent in the attempted assassination.
Confirmation of the poisoning came hours after dramatic video emerged of one of the victims being loaded into an ambulance by a paramedic wearing hazmat gear.
Mr Rowley, a registered heroin addict, was lying on his back in a stretcher as the paramedic in a white protective suit pushed it inside as two police officers watched on.
Assistant Commissioner of Specialist Operations Neil Basu said blood samples were tested at the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down and confirmed to be Novichok.
'Following the detailed analysis of these samples, we can confirm that the man and woman have been exposed to the nerve agent Novichok, which has been identified as the same nerve agent that contaminated both Yulia and Sergei Skripal,' he said.
'The latest update we have from the hospital is that both patients remain in a critical condition. Both are British nationals and are local to the area. Officers are still working to identify their next of kin.
'The priority for the investigation team now, is to establish how these two people have come into contact with this nerve agent.'
Assistant Commissioner of Specialist Operations Neil Basu, pictured right alongside England's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies, confirmed the substance was Novichok nerve agent
Several places the couple visited or may have visited after they were exposed were locked down by police, including a church and Boots store. Ms Sturgess lives just 300 yards from Zizzi's where the Skripals ate the day they were poisoned
ASCO Basu said no-one else had presented with the same symptoms so far.
He said about 100 detectives from the Counter Terrorism Policing Network were investigating along with local Wiltshire Police, and had already locked down areas they were believed to have been.
They included a public rubbish bin in the corner of Rollestone Street just yards from the John Baker House homeless shelter where Ms Sturgess lives.
A Boots where Mr Rowley picked up his prescription after his exposure, the Amesbury Baptist Church, and the Queen Elizabeth Gardens, a popular family park on the outskirts of Salisbury, were also locked down by police.
It was believed the couple may have attended a village fete on Saturday, run by the church, on Raleigh Crescent.
'I do want to reassure the public, however, that there is no evidence that either the man or woman recently visited any of the sites that were decontaminated following the attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal,' ASCO Basu said.
Dramatic video has emerged of a poisoning victim being loaded into an ambulance by a paramedic wearing hazmat gear
Initially police believed the pair, understood to be recreational drug users, had come into contact with a contaminated batch of Class A drugs.
But on Wednesday a major incident was declared after it emerged the substance could be poison - with Scotland Yard and the Ministry of Defence drafted in to help investigate.
Wiltshire Police said it was 'open-minded' about the cause and said it was not clear whether a crime had been committed.
ASCO Basu said police prescence would be beefed up in Salisbury and Amsebury similar to how it was when the Skripals were attacked.
Officers would be wearing protective clothing and testing various sites - likely the ones already cordoned off - but this was just a precaution.
'This is a precautionary, but necessary measure that allows officers to safely carry out meticulous and systematic searches for evidence to support the investigation,' he said.
'This must be done with great care as you will appreciate, to ensure there is no outstanding risk to both those brave officers and the public.'

What is the Novichok nerve agent used against the Skripals? The Novichok nerve agent used against former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia is among the most deadly poisons ever created. They were secretly developed by the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold war in the 1970s and 1980s. Communist scientists developed the poison so it would not be able to be detected by Nato's chemical detection equipment. They come in the form of a ultra-fine powder, Novichok is up to eight times more potent than the deadly VX gas. Victims who are poisoned by the powder suffer muscle spasms, breathing problems and then cardiac arrest. There is a known antidote to the nerve agent - atropine can block the poison. But doctors find it very tricky to administer the antidote because the dose would have to be so high it could prove fatal for the person. Novichok poisons are highly dangerous to handle, requiring the expertise of skilled scientists in a sophisticated lab. Dr Vil Mirzayanov, former Chief of the Foreign Technical Counterintelligence Department at Russia’s premiere, was among the team of scientists who helped develop the agent. In an article about the lethal weapon, he wrote: 'They are extremely dangerous – most likely lethal – for people who would try to synthesise or manipulate them without the help of highly experienced scientists and engineers in special laboratory installations observing extreme safety measures. 'Without exception, Novichok weapons cannot be used for any reason without specially trained military personnel under medical supervision.'
ASCO Basu said he understood there would be speculation that the two poisonings were linked but the 'complex' investigation into the Skiprals' attempted murders was still ongoing.
'Detectives continue to sift through and assess all the available evidence and are following every possible lead to identify those responsible, for what remains a reckless and barbaric criminal act,' he said.
'We are not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to. The possibility that these two investigations might be linked is clearly a line of enquiry for us.
'It is important, however, that the investigation is led by the evidence available and the facts alone and we don't make any assumptions.'
He said Public Health England said, based on the number of casualties affected, it was not believed that there was a significant health risk to the wider public from either poisoning.
England's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies told residents not to be alarmed, even if they had visited the areas now cordoned off since the couple were exposed.
'My advice for any individual that may have been in any of the areas now cordoned off from 10pm on Friday evening onwards is highly precautionary,' she said.
'As before my advice is to wash your clothes and wipe down any personal items, shoes and bags with cleansing and baby wipes before disposing of them in the usual way.
'This is the same public health advice I gave during the previous incident, but now as a belt and braces approach.
'I should also warn the public to be careful, as always of picking up any unknown or already dangerous objects such as needles and syringes.
'You do not need to seek advice from a health professional unless you are experiencing symptoms as any individual, who had been significantly exposed at the same time, would by now, have symptoms.'
Investigators are urgently retracing the couple's steps to try to identify where the suspected poisoning occurred.
Friends said the couple spent Friday afternoon and evening in Salisbury, where they visited a number of shops, including an off-licence, mobile phone store and chemist.
They also bought food and a blanket from a charity shop so they could relax in the sun in Queen Elizabeth Gardens in the city.
The couple's close friend, mechanic Sam Hobson, 29, said Mrs Sturgess went to hospital first.
He then went to Boots with Mr Rowley to collect a prescription before attending a church fair. When they returned home Mr Rowley began to feel unwell too.

'He started sweating. His T-shirt was soaking wet. He got up and started rocking against the wall,' Mr Hobson recalled.
'His eyes were wide open and red, his pupils were like pinpricks. He began gabbling incoherently and I could tell he was hallucinating. He was making weird noises and acting like a zombie. I phoned an ambulance.
'At first they thought it was drugs but they know now it isn't.'
Mr Hobson said both victims were being held in isolation at Salisbury District Hospital and Ms Sturgess's flat in a hostel in the city centre cordoned off.
In January she moved into John Baker House, a homeless shelter 300 yards from the Zizzi Italian restaurant where the Skripals ate before they collapsed.
Officers have also cordoned off Mr Sturgess's housing association home on a newly-built estate in Amesbury, close to Stonehenge.

Neighbour Amy Ireland, 32, said the estate was packed with firemen, police and paramedics on Saturday. 'There was a huge commotion. Cordons were set up and people were being moved back,' she said. 'People thought it was a gas leak at first.'
Mrs Sturgess's cousin, 31-year-old Ross Hewitt, said she was in an induced coma after suffering a seizure and a heart attack.
'She has never had seizures before. It was out of the blue. Her partner, shortly after the call that she made to the medical services, also suffered a seizure and a heart attack which was a bit weird,' he said.
On Saturday, Amesbury Baptist Church held a family fun day event on the village green of Raleigh Crescent. It is believed the couple could have been among the 200 guests.

Mr Collins said around 200 people attended the community event, including many families and children, but 'nobody else has suffered any ill-effects'.
'There have been no reports of any other incidents,' he added.
'It was a beautiful, sunny day and it was a glorious event, there was nothing going on that was nefarious. This is a real surprise and shock to us - we do continue to keep the couple in our prayers.'

A neighbour who lives in the same block of flats as the couple described how he saw each of them being stretchered from their flat into waiting ambulances.
The man in his 30s, who did not want to be named, said they were 'lovely people'.
Speaking through the window of his ground floor flat, which is inside the police cordon in Muggleton Road, he said: 'It was about 10.30am on Saturday, when I saw Dawn being taken out on a stretcher.
'Then later that evening, Charlie was also taken out and put into an ambulance. There were lots of emergency vehicles about and we were all told to stay in our homes.
'Charlie and Dawn haven't been living at the flat long at all, and I've only met them a coupe of times but they seem like lovely people. They seem decent.'
Residents living near Muggleton Road said they were initially told the evacuation was down to a gas leak.
The town is just seven miles from Salisbury, where Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia (pictured together) were poisoned with a nerve agent in March
Mayor of Amesbury, Councillor Margaret Strange, on Wednesday night visited the estate to 'reassure residents' and read a statement.
'I'm here because I just want to be some kind of reassurance to the residents,' said said outside the flat where the couple collapsed.
'There are quite a number of residents on this estate and many of them are children and rumours go flying around.
'The council just want to reassure them that at the moment it is considered safe to move around and if we all go along as calmly as we can this will hopefully resolve itself quickly.
'I am here because I represent the town and I want us to keep as calm as we can and go about our daily business as best as we can. People should keep as calm as they can and when we know something we will tell them.'
Nerve agent victim Yulia Skripal 'intends to soon return to Russia' despite Putin being blamed for her poisoning By Will Stewart In Moscow for MailOnline Yulia Skripal has sensationally indicated she intends 'soon' to return to Russia, according to a Moscow newspaper. The 34-year-old victim of nerve agent poisoning in Salisbury recently spoke by phone to a friend and a relative in her home country, it was claimed. Her reported desire to return to her homeland - which could not be independently verified - comes despite Theresa May directly blaming Russia for the poisoning. Moscow strenuously denies poisoning Yulia and her ex-spy father Sergei Skripal four months ago. Yulia Skripal (pictured in May) left hospital in April and gave her first interview last month, outlining her desire to return to Russia in the future despite the poisoning Yulia called a woman named only as Diana who is renovating her flat in Moscow and told her 'she was doing well and that she was due to come to Russia soon', Moskovsky Komsomolets (MK) newspaper reported. She also 'gave a special order' not to allow her own cousin Viktoria Skripal, 45, access to her flat, the woman was quoted as saying. The report further claimed Yulia met a close Russian friend called Gulnara in London. Gulnara was interviewed and exonerated by Scotland Yard after she brought a package of buckwheat from Russia to London around the time the Skripals were poisoned. She has been 'in constant touch' with Stepan Vikeev, 30, Yulia's mysterious boyfriend who has vanished since the poisoning, MK claimed. Vikeev was reported to have had connections to the FSB security service. It is unclear from MK if Yulia has been in direct contact with Vikeev since the poisoning. The newspaper claimed he initially had a 'mental breakdown' after she was poisoning, and he then disappeared. It stated his 'desire to go below the parapet can mean only one thing, that Stepan holds some information. 'And it is quite possible that Russian special services had used him as a way of monitoring the English life of Sergey Skripal (considered a traitor in his homeland), because quite likely Yulia was sharing certain details about it with Stepan. 'There is also another version, that Stepan is so scared for his reputation that he wants to be as far away as possible from the scandalous family.' The report further claimed Yulia met in London a close Russian friend called Gulnara, was interviewed and exonerated by Scotland Yard after she brought a package of buckwheat from Russia to London around the time the Skripals were poisoned Sergei Skripal (pictured) and his daughter were poisoned with chemical agent Novichok and found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury on March 4 Vikeev's mother Tatiana - also reportedly with links to the FSB - took her son to Sochi to recuperate for three weeks, and later he stayed out of sight with a business trip to the Arctic, it was claimed. Meanwhile, the newspaper reported Yulia called her cousin Viktoria 'several days ago' and demanded she stop interfering in her life. Viktoria has led a campaign with support of other family members to visit Yulia and Sergei in Britain, and to demand the UK authorities give more information about their health and the conditions in which they are living in a reported 'safe house'. Britain has repeatedly refused to issue Viktoria a visa. The paper quotes Yulia in an extraordinary telephone blast at her cousin. 'This is Yulia Skripal, if you remember me,' she is reported to have said. 'I am calling to say that you acted in a disgusting way. We did not allow you to meddle into this situation. 'Neither my flat, nor my car, or my dog have anything to do with you. I am assisting my father and working on my own recovery.' Yulia attacked Viktoria for her earlier remarks that the poisoning victim's voice in a video statement suggested she was not speaking freely, and could have been under British influence. 'How is that any of your business what tone I used to speak in my video message?' she said. 'I can't come back now because you go on (Russian) talk shows, and you made all this a public affair. Please stop meddling with this story. Moscow strenuously denies poisoning Yulia and her ex-spy father Sergei Skripal with a novichok nerve agent four months ago Viktoria is devastated by the verbal attack from her cousin, which she tonight confirmed to MailOnline. 'I am shocked and stunned as are the rest of our family,' she said. She had been trying to help Yulia by launching her campaign, and Yulia indicated she was speaking with her father's knowledge, Viktoria said. But Viktoria said she remained 'saddened and upset' as to why Sergei has not contacted his beloved 89 year old mother Yelena, even though his health has reportedly improved since he regained consciousness after the novichok attack. Viktoria is the mother's long-time carer at her home in Yaroslavl. She said Yulia had not asked in their phone conversation about the her grandmother's health. Yulia has rejected help from the Russian embassy in London, according to her public statement.
The investigation comes four months after the chemical weapon attack on the Skripals sparked an international outcry.
The British Government accused the Kremlin of co-ordinating the attempted hit years after Mr Skripal, 67, arrived in the UK in a spy swap.
Investigators believe the Novichok nerve agent was smeared on their front door and the Skripals unwittingly contaminated swathes of Salisbury.

David Ramos Contreras, 27, (pictured) is also wanted for the alleged assault. He was last seen on Saturday with two women at a Walmart in Holland, Ohio
They had been staying at a Days Inn motel in Bowling Green with their mother at the time of the incident.
The girl's mother took them to be examined at a local hospital, where police arrived around 11pm.
Nationwide arrest warrants have since been issued for the three men, according to CNN.
Simon Juan Thomas, 24, (pictured) has been arrested and charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor in the incident
All three have been classified as dangerous, while Thomas is currently being held in Wood County on $50,000 bond.
Police said Contreras was last seen on Saturday with two women in a vehicle at a Walmart in Holland, Ohio.
The two women are believed to have given Contreras a ride.
Authorities believe that the men had been staying at the Days Inn for a week before the alleged assaults.
The victims are also believed to have been living in the motel at the time.
All four suspects were also found to be carrying 'fraudulent paperwork' that documented their status as immigrant workers, according to authorities.

It was discovered that Adiel had a permanent resident ID card from Fellsmere, Florida that was fraudulent.
Authorities revealed that Contreras had previously been deported from the country.
The US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Agency is also involved in the search for the four men.

"(Reuters Health) - Parents can make the most of their time at their child's routine pediatrician visits by preparing for each appointment, according to a new resource published in JAMA Pediatrics.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children see a pediatrician regularly and often during their first three years of life.

""Parents' time is becoming more and more precious, and these appointments are so frequent, that we want to help people make the most of that time,"" said Dr. Maheen Quadri of Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, who co-wrote the one-page primer intended for parents and caregivers.
""One of the most important things we do during these visits is give vaccines,"" Quadri said in a phone interview. ""Before appointments, it's important to know what's up-to-date.""
The freely accessible patient page (https://bit.ly/2MJ6OyI) emphasizes the best ways for parents to prepare children and their medical files before meeting with doctors.
""It's also really valuable to have that one-on-one time with a doctor, especially when we have so many resources online with different medical advice,"" she said. ""Having that connection with a person who has expertise can be a source of support as you go through the new experience of parenting.""

Quadri and co-author Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison first recommend knowing your child's history and family's history to ensure that medical records are accurate and up-to-date. Don't forget to transfer them if seeing a new clinician, and consider taking a folder with your child's records to appointments.
The doctor will ask questions about your child's health, your family's health and your child's development at every visit. It helps to be familiar with developmental milestones, such as crawling, walking, and different phases of talking. The doctor may ask you to fill out development questionnaires to assess how your child's growth is progressing, so pay attention to these milestones between visits.
""Many parents don't realize that yearly health supervision or 'check-up' visits are recommended for children age 3 (years) and up as well,"" said Dr. Jennifer Shu of Children's Medical Group in Atlanta, Georgia, who is also medical editor of HealthyChildren.org.
""When children are younger and making frequent visits to the pediatrician for routine immunizations and the expected toddler illnesses, going to the doctor is top-of-mind,"" she told Reuters Health by email. ""Once kids start elementary school, check-ups can fall out of habit.""
The patient resource also recommends bringing a list of questions about health and development topics to visits. For questions about movements or behaviors, for instance, consider bringing a picture or video. For children who take medicine, including inhalers, it helps to bring the drugs to the visit to confirm current doses and ask any questions.
It's also important to talk to your child before the visit to prepare for it. This can depend on your child's age and maturity, but in general, it is best to be as honest as you can about the visit and what it will involve, including undressing or physical exams. Talk about the possibility of shots and blood tests, and explain that these are normal to do. Try to schedule a fun activity after the visit to reward your child for a job well done, and avoid describing doctor visits or vaccines as punishments or part of behavior negotiations.
For the times when you're waiting at the doctor's office, consider bringing drinks, snacks, books and toys. Think of this as protected time you get to spend with your child.
""I encourage parents to pick a time of year that's convenient and easy to remember so it becomes a yearly routine,"" Shu said. ""For example, some of my patients like to bring all of their kids at the same time while on summer break.""
Shu takes her daughter to the pediatrician every fall on her birthday so she can get a flu vaccine at the same time. Other parents plan annual check-ups when school, sports or camp forms are needed.
""Some families have experiences with the healthcare system that aren't always the most positive, and seeing a doctor often can seem uncomfortable or strange,"" Quadri said. ""We're here to support parents, answer their questions and monitor their child's development over time.""

"Sweden's defensive juggernaut Andreas Granqvist is prepared to miss the birth of his own child in order to play in their World Cup quarter-final against England on Saturday.
The 33-year-old has been the standout performer for Sweden in their shock march to the last eight in Russia, playing in all four games and scoring two goals including the winner against South Korea.
With his wife due to give birth to their second child any day now, Granqvist would be well within his rights to go home to be by her side. However, he says he and his wife were prepared for this situation.
Sweden's defensive juggernaut Andreas Granqvist will not go home for the birth of his child
'I'm planning to stay,' he said. 'My wife is a very strong person and we knew the situation before I came here. Nothing has happened so far.
'If I have the position to fly home quickly then I may do that. But, whatever happens, I do not miss the quarter-final.'
The news comes as Fabian Delph made his return to the England camp following the birth of his third child. The Manchester City midfielder returned back to the UK to be by his wife's side last Friday and missed their shoot-out victory over Colombia.
Delph has been a squad player for Gareth Southgate thus far and his absence from the team was not deemed overly detrimental to their chances of beating the South Americans. Conversely, Granqvist's absence would be a major blow for Sweden.
The towering No 4 has been the standout star in Sweden's organised defence at this World Cup
Fabian Delph sits on a plane as he rejoins the England squad following the birth of his child
Sweden are performing at their highest level at a World Cup since coming third in 1994 despite the fact they chose not to include talismanic striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the 23-man squad.
Granqvist, who admits England are playing better football than when the two nations last met in 2012, believes the lack of big names has actually been beneficial and enabled them to work as a collective unit instead.
He said: 'We play with a very good, compact defence. We lost a lot of big names — we had to start from the beginning and play with 23 players, not one or two.
'We've worked really hard and we've shown that we really work for each other, we fight for each other and we do it as a collective. That's the strength of Sweden at the moment.
'Harry Kane is fantastic,' he said. 'They play more offensively now than they did before, with skilful players like [Raheem] Sterling. But they will find it difficult.",www.dailymail.co.uk,2018-07-04 23:11:37,22,252216
"Anthony Gelling's Warriors contract will last just one season after he signed a Super League deal with Widnes from 2019.
Gelling has penned a two-year contract, taking him back to England where he enjoyed six productive seasons with Wigan.
The 27-year-old centre has struggled to break into the Warriors' first-choice starting line-up, making six appearances.
He made his third start in last week's loss to Cronulla, when he scored his second try for the club.
The Auckland-born Cook Islands international was a prime target for Widnes according to their interim head coach Francis Cummins.
""He has ability to produce something out of nothing,"" Cummins told the club's website.
""Players of his quality are few and far between, and we are excited that he will be representing our club.""

Fleet-footed France will have to find a way past the tournament's joint-meanest defenders Uruguay in the first of two inter-continental World Cup quarter-finals on Friday.
NIZHNY NOVGOROD, Russia: Fleet-footed France will have to find a way past the tournament's joint-meanest defenders Uruguay in the first of two inter-continental World Cup quarter-finals on Friday.
The South Americans kept Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo at bay in their 2-1 last-16 win, and that goal conceded was the only one against them so far in Russia - a defensive feat only matched by Brazil, who play Belgium later on Friday.

But France banged in four goals in their last 16 game against Argentina, and will be hoping their formidable attacking trio of Antoine Griezmann, Olivier Giroud and Kylian Mbappe can turn it on again at the Nizhny Novgorod stadium.
Nineteen-year-old Mbappe scored two goals in the Argentina game, becoming the first teenager since Brazilian great Pele in the 1958 final to score two goals in one World Cup match.
But it was his amazing 70-metre sprint earlier in the match, to win France a penalty, that stunned viewers worldwide.
""I was wondering whether he was riding a scooter,"" joked France midfielder Florian Thauvin of the teenager whom Uruguay's defenders must be having nightmares about.

On the surface, though, Uruguay look relaxed and their experienced central defenders Jose Gimenez and Diego Godin are relishing the chance to foil both Mbappe and their friend and Atletico Madrid team mate Griezmann.
""We want to deny them space, stop them playing, make their strikers uncomfortable - that's our weapon,"" said midfielder Diego Laxalt at the Uruguay camp in a hotel outside Nizhny Novgorod which, oddly, is painted in the colours of Brazil.
With an impressive strike partnership of their own in Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani, the Uruguayans believe they can surpass their most recent best of a semi-final in 2010 - though Cavani is sweating on a calf injury that may keep him out.
'Les Bleus' will be inspired by the two-decade anniversary of their only World Cup win in 1998, while double winners Uruguay's modern generation are desperate to recreate the black-and-white-era glories of their 1930 and 1950 trophies.
The winners will play Brazil or Belgium, who meet in their quarter-final in Kazan on Friday evening, for a place in the July 15 final.

"The company had to shift its production to a new plant at Sanand in Gujarat. (Reuters)
Tata Motors’ small car Nano is inching closer towards the end of its journey with just one unit produced in June, although the company maintained that no decision has been taken yet on stopping its production.
The entry level car, brainchild of Ratan Tata who envisaged giving a safer and affordable alternative to families riding on two-wheelers, sold just three units last month in the domestic market.
In a regulatory filing, Tata Motors said there was no export of Nano in June this year. It had shipped 25 units in the same month last year.
In terms of production, only one unit was produced last month as against 275 units in June 2017.
Domestic sales were at three units in June as against 167 units in the year-ago month.
When contacted for comments on whether the company has taken a decision to stop Nano production, a Tata Motors spokesperson said, “We are well aware that the Nano in its present form cannot continue beyond 2019 and may need fresh investments to survive. No decision has been made yet in this regard.”
The spokesperson further said, “Meanwhile, we continue to produce Nano catering to customer demand in key markets.”
Nano, which was unveiled in January 2008 at the Auto Expo with much expectations of being the people’s car, could not live up to the billing.
The car was launched in the market in March 2009 with an initial price of close to Rs 1 lakh for the basic model despite cost escalations, with Ratan Tata insisting that “a promise is a promise”.
However, from the beginning, Nano courted trouble. It was originally planned to be rolled out from Tata Motors’ proposed plant at Singur in West Bengal, where it faced intense political and farmer protests against land acquisition.
The company had to shift its production to a new plant at Sanand in Gujarat.
Instances of the car catching fire initially after it was launched didn’t help its cause either.
Ratan Tata had admitted that the company made the mistake of promoting the Nano as ‘the cheapest car’.
It become a loss-making model for Tata Motors with ex-Tata Sons chairman Mistry, who was abruptly removed from the post, even went on to claim that the Nano “consistently lost value, peaking at Rs 1,000 crore”.
Mistry also termed the Nano as one of the “legacy hotspots” and there was “no line of sight to profitability for the Nano, any turnaround strategy”.
He had also claimed that Tata Motors did not stop producing the car due to “emotional reasons”.",www.financialexpress.com,2018-07-04 23:10:07,18,244520

"China will ""absolutely not"" fire the first shot in a trade war with the United States and will not be the first to levy tariffs, its finance ministry said on Wednesday.
A person with knowledge of the plan earlier told Reuters China's threatened tariffs on $US34 billion ($A46 billion) of US goods would take effect from the beginning of the day on Friday. Given the 12-hour time difference, that would have put its implementation ahead of Washington's.
But the ministry issued a brief clarification in response.
""The Chinese government's position has been stated many times. We absolutely will not fire the first shot, and will not implement tariff measures ahead of the United States doing so,"" it said, without elaborating.
Washington has said it would implement tariffs on $US34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6, and Beijing has vowed to retaliate in kind on the same day.
Earlier, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China was ready to act, though he did not confirm the start date for Chinese tariffs.
""China has already made preparations,"" Lu told a daily news briefing.
""As long as the United States issues a so-called tariff list, China will take necessary measures to firmly protect its legitimate interests,"" he added, without elaborating.
Chinese state media on Wednesday kept up a steady drumbeat of criticism of the United States.
The official China Daily said the United States was intentionally trying to prevent China from developing to keep it from challenging the former's role in the global economic order.
""The US has maintained hegemony in the military and financial fields for many decades. Now it is pursuing economic hegemony,"" the English-language newspaper said in an editorial.
Widely-read tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, said the increasingly likely trade war would bring chaos to the world.
""Counterstrike is major economies' first reaction to Washington's trade war,"" it said in its editorial.
US President Donald Trump has threatened to escalate the trade conflict with tariffs on as much as $US400 billion in Chinese goods if Beijing retaliates against the US tariffs set to take effect on Friday.

"The multi-million clean up after Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned wasn't enough to stop two others being exposed to the nerve agent.
Nine locations in and around Salisbury were sealed off after the attack four months ago.
But Dawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, are fighting for life after they were exposed to the deadly novichok substance in Amesbury on Saturday.

Paramedics wearing hazmat suits work on Mr Rowley before he is loaded into the ambulance
The clean-up is said to have cost 'tens of millions' but still wasn't enough to prevent what is feared to have been an exposure caused by leftover novichok
Around 190 personnel from the Army and RAF were drafted in to carry out the specialist cleaning of areas in wake of the March posioning.
The work has involved testing for any remaining traces, removing items which may have been contaminated, chemical cleaning and then retesting.
But footage emerged of Mr Rowley being wheeled into an ambulance by paramedics wearing protective white suits after he was exposed just 300 yards from the restaurant were Skripal was eating when he fell ill.

Several places the couple visited or may have visited after they were exposed were locked down by police, including a church and Boots store. Ms Sturgess lives just 300 yards from Zizzi's where the Skripals ate the day they were poisoned
Soldiers cleaned up nine locations in and around the site of the original incident only for two more people to be poisoned
Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess have been named as the couple who were exposed to the substance in Amesbury
The sites targeted in the clean-up included three in Salisbury city centre – were sealed off from the public with secure fencing and protected by patrolling police and security guards.
But it is now feared that this latest exposure to novichok could have been caused by leftovers of the agent from the attack.
The Maltings shopping precinct – near where former Russian spy Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed – was the first sealed off site to reopen on May 21.
The ambulance stations in Salisbury and Amesbury have also since reopened. The Bourne Hill office block, which houses council and police staff, has been decontaminated but is still closed for remedial work.

We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said in a statement.The WTO analysis found that G20 countries introduced 39 new trade restrictions between mid-October last year and mid-May this year, double the rate seen in the previous period, affecting trade in iron and steel, plastics and vehicles.""The marked increase in new trade restrictive measures among G20 economies should be of real concern to the international community,"" Azevedo said, adding that more restrictions had been put in place in the weeks after the period under review ended.The WTO report did not name any particular country, but since the start of the year U.S. President Donald Trump has launched a series of tariffs to punish what he sees as unfair trade, by allies and economic rivals alike.""At a juncture where the global economy is finally beginning to generate sustained economic momentum following the global financial crisis, the uncertainty created by a proliferation of trade restrictive actions could place economic recovery in jeopardy,"" the WTO report said.It added that the world trading system was built to resolve such problems but the escalating tensions were a threat to the system itself, and G20 economies needed to use all means at their disposal to de-escalate the situation and promote further trade recovery.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,2018-07-04 23:07:00,7,634894
"July 4 (Reuters) - Two British citizens are critically ill after they were exposed to the Novichok nerve agent which struck down a former Russian agent and his daughter in March, Britain's top counter-terrorism officer said on Wednesday.
Here is a brief overview of Novichok: * First developed in the former Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s, Novichok, or ""newcomer,"" is a series of highly toxic nerve agents with a slightly different chemical composition than the more commonly known VX and sarin poison gases. * Novichok agents are believed to be five to 10 times more lethal, although there are no known previous uses. Moscow is not believed to have ever declared Novichok or its ingredients to the Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which oversees a treaty banning their use.
* Novichok, the fourth generation of poison gas, was made with agrochemicals so that offensive weapons production could more readily be hidden within a legitimate commercial industry, according to U.S. chemical weapons expert Amy Smithson.
* Publications about development and testing of Novichok in the 1990s led to U.S. suspicions that the then-USSR had a secret weapons program and did not declare all it had in its stockpile when it joined the OPCW. * Russia, along with the United States, once ran one of the largest chemical weapons programs in the world. It completed the destruction of a stockpile declared to the OPCW last year. The United States is in the final stages of destroying its own stockpile.
* Russia was once believed to possess thousands of tonnes of weaponised Novichok varieties and their precursors, according to a 2014 report by the U.S.-based Nuclear Threat Initiative, a non-partisan group working to reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction.
* The chemical ""causes a slowing of the heart and restriction of the airways, leading to death by asphyxiation,"" said Professor Gary Stephens, a pharmacology expert at the University of Reading. ""One of the main reasons these agents are developed is because their component parts are not on the banned list.""
* The weaponisation of any chemical is banned under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, of which Moscow is a signatory.

"A right hip strain is forcing Gleyber Torres to the sideline for an extended stretch.
The Yankees' rookie second baseman came out of New York's game against the Atlanta Braves after the fourth inning Wednesday. Following the game, the team announced that it was placing Torres on the disabled list effective Thursday.
Torres was scratched from the starting lineup Tuesday due to the same ailment, though he wound up appearing as a defensive replacement.
Yankees manager Aaron Boone said pregame Wednesday, ""I was excited about how he came in (Tuesday). I knew he was fine (Tuesday). I didn't hesitate to put him in (Wednesday).""
Torres was 0-for-2 on Wednesday before he was subbed out, with Brandon Drury entering to play third base and Neil Walker moving to second base.
The team was sending Torres for medical tests, so there was no immediate announcement of a timetable for his return.
The 21-year-old Venezuelan is batting .294 with a .350 on-base percentage, a .555 slugging percentage, 15 homers and 42 RBIs in 63 games this year, his first major league season. He made his debut April 22.
Signed by the Cubs as a 16-year-old international free agent in July 2013, Torres came to the Yankees' farm system in the deal that sent closer Aroldis Chapman to Chicago in July 2016.

"Oltmans has been given two years to turn around the fortunes of Pakistan. Oltmans has been given two years to turn around the fortunes of Pakistan.
Under-fire Pakistan hockey coach Roelant Oltmans will continue to remain at the helm despite critics calling for his head in the aftermath of the national team’s last place finish at the just-concluded Champions Trophy in Breda, Netherlands.
The Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) has lend its support to the Dutchman, who is facing severe criticism from former players after Pakistan finished with just a win over Olympic champions Argentina in the final edition of the prestigious six-nation event.
Former international player Zahid Sharif blamed Oltmans for the disappointing performance in the Champions Trophy and even accused him of fixing the round robin match against India.
“He (Oltmans) has been with the Indian hockey team and the federation for a long time and his decision to withdraw the goalkeeper against India was to fix the match and allow the Indians to win,” Sharif alleged.
Former Olympian and captain Samiullah warned that if the performances of Pakistan in the Champions Trophy were a indicator he feared the national team would even find it hard to beat minnows like Thailand and China in the Asian Games in August.
“I see no improvement in this team at all. We just went from bad to worse. The experiment with handing over all charge to Oltmans and his foreign coaches has not worked at all,” he lamented.
The PHF, however, has not bothered to take these allegations seriously. PHF officials have expressed overall satisfaction with the performance of the team although Pakistan won just one out of six matches in the competition.
A PHF official said that Oltmans had been in charge of the team just for four months and in two events and it would be unfair to judge him on that basis.
“There is no going back. Oltmans will remain in charge for the coming Asian Games and World Cup,” the official said.
Veteran Pakistan goalkeeper Imran Butt too backed Oltmans, who has remained back in Netherlands for a few days.
“True we finished last but we put up good showings against top teams and there are visible signs of improvement in our set-up and thinking now,” Butt said.
Pakistan’s caretaker government, however, has taken the team’s poor show very seriously and have asked the PHF for a detailed report and warned that special grants for hockey could be stopped immediately.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani players made a quiet return home from Netherlands last night amidst growing calls for the sacking of Dutch head coach Oltmans and other support staff.

"Some women credit years of hard work for their career success, others say it’s about taking risks or never taking ‘no’ for an answer.
But clothes designer Rachel Riley, whose luxury childrenswear is worn by Prince George no less, roundly points to a factor that’s far closer to home and perhaps less expected — motherhood.
‘I feel very strongly that becoming a mother gives you self-belief, focus, concentration and the ability to be a brilliant multi-tasker,’ she explains. ‘It made me realise what I valued in life.
‘It wasn’t just in a financial sense but I wanted to do something where I could be a good role model for my children.’ She adds: ‘Before I had children, time was more elastic. Although I was fairly business-minded, I didn’t have the same perspective. It was all about me, no one else. After I’d had children, I was so much better at compartmentalising my life. I knew I wanted to “have it all” — a family and a career.’
Designer Rachel Riley (pictured) says that becoming a mother helped her to become a better businesswoman
With her eponymous label, Cambridge graduate and former model Rachel, 55 — who has two sons and a daughter now in their 20s — has showrooms in London, New York, Atlanta and Dallas and her clothing range has a long list of celebrity clients including David Beckham, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jamie Oliver and Beyonce, not to mention the Royal Family.
But until now her belief that motherhood boosts women’s productivity has been at odds with the prevailing wisdom. For decades, study after study concluded that having children is more likely to have a detrimental effect on a woman’s career.
It’s certainly had an impact on women’s earnings. Earlier this year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that by the time a couple’s first child is aged 20, many mothers earn nearly a third less than fathers.
Mothers are more likely to be side-lined for promotion. The problem is so widespread that it’s even got a name — The Motherhood Penalty.
Yet new evidence is emerging to back up the designer’s thesis. It suggests that having children makes you a better employee and that the Motherhood Penalty is actually spectacularly unfair.
Helen Nelson, pictured with her children, agrees, and says that having children has only helped her in her career in the NHS
‘For years we’ve been told women are not as productive once they’ve had children because childcare and household responsibilities tend to fall on the woman — but actually, being a mother may make you more productive,’ says sociologist Dr Heejung Chung of The University of Kent.
One recent study looked at 10,000 economists working in academia. ‘They looked at research papers published. It turned out that those economists who were mothers were more productive than those women without children.
‘Another recent study showed that taking care of children enhanced your capacity to be better managers — not only of your own time but with conflict in the workplace.
‘You only have to think about what it’s like dealing with toddlers to know that you have more flexibility with the way you think.
‘That transfers to dealing with personal issues in the workplace. Mothers are very aware of their time. I know from my own experience that before children, I worked all hours. But once I had the school pick-up looming and deadlines to meet, I became more focused and productive in the time I had.’
Certainly, having a baby no longer has to mean the end of a successful career and while there’s an assumption that women return to the workplace lacking confidence in their abilities, many say the opposite is true.
Serena Williams, currently seeded 25 at Wimbledon after having her daughter, says she believes motherhood has boosted her self-belief. This, despite the fact that she left tennis last year ranked No1 in the world and returned in May, a mother, ranked 453rd.
Rachel says that having a child helped her to compartmentalise her life and plan her future better
Serena is one of a number of elite female athletes to return from maternity leave stronger, faster and — crucially — more determined.
Paula Radcliffe won the New York Marathon less than a year after having her first child. Belgian tennis player Kim Clijsters, another former World No1, won three of her four Grand Slam titles after having her first child.
In celebrity circles, actresses Emilia Fox, Emily Blunt and Maggie Gyllenhaal have credited motherhood with making them better at their jobs. While anecdotal accounts from mothers indicate they are more organised after giving birth, there may well be a biological reason why they are more efficient than women with- out children.
Neuroscientists have discovered that a woman’s brain is changed for at least two years after giving birth. This ‘mummy brain’ phenomenon has always been thought to be damaging — a fogginess and forgetfulness that tired parents will know only too well. Yet there’s also a theory that new mothers are more focused where it matters.
In one study, 25 women who became mothers for the first time had an MRI scan. After completing their pregnancies, they were rescanned alongside women who had never given birth.
The new mothers showed a loss of grey matter in several brain areas associated with social cognition, a form of emotional intelligence.
While this sounds alarming, researchers argue that it may actually be beneficial.
‘Loss of volume does not necessarily translate to loss of function,’ says Elseline Hoekzema, a senior brain scientist at Leiden University in the Netherlands adding, ‘sometimes less is more.’ She suggests that the loss of grey matter could ‘represent a fine-tuning of synapses into more efficient neural networks.’
Helen says that although her career has been interrupted, becoming a mother has only contributed in a positive way to her career
Other studies on mothers’ brains show that they are less likely to show fear in the face of threat — perhaps making them bolder than their childless counterparts.
In one experiment a U.S. psychologist noted that, when exposed to stress, mother rats were less likely to freeze and showed fewer switched-on neurons in the amygdala part of the brain (meaning they were displaying less fear) than childless participants.
Translated into an office environment, this suggests that mothers may be better able to deal with work-stress than non-mothers — perhaps thanks to a greater sense of what’s really important to them.
One high-flying mother who believes this could be the case is Fiona McDonnell, European Director of Beer, Wine and Spirits at Amazon.
‘I’ve found that becoming a mum has helped me a great deal in my career, particularly as it has enabled me to gain a lot of perspective and focus on the important things, like saying “no” more and trusting your gut feeling to make quicker, better decisions.’
Despite this, research suggests that more than 50,000 women a year drop out of the workforce when they have children
Fiona, 47, who lives in London with husband Riemer, a house husband and their two sons aged seven and four, adds: ‘The clarity that stems from having a little baby that depends on you is enlightening.
‘I was surprised how much stuff is suddenly not that important — and that skill stays with you. You quickly develop your own routine and this will help manage colleagues’ expectations of you in the process.
‘When I had my first child, I was the managing director of a Dutch manufacturing firm.
‘At that time, I was working late and wondered how I would ever be able to keep up with the intense demands of the job —especially as I’d decided to still feed the baby myself.
‘Logistically, the first few months were brutally organised to allow for both feeding and work, but it was important to me that I did this for my child. ‘I had no extended family nearby, but my husband and I became a real team — we found a way. What at first sounded impossible soon became routine, and I quickly found I dropped the things that didn’t matter, made different choices and became way more productive as a result.’
Helen says that becoming a mother has helped her to be better organised and she now has better time-management skills
Fiona admits she is lucky to have the flexibility of a husband who stays at home with the children. ‘I couldn’t do this job and enjoy the kids as much as I do without his support.
‘It is tough being a full-time working mum, but I love what I do and I remind myself that it was a choice that we made as a family.’
She says she’s learned from her children, too. ‘There’s many a parent who has learnt a lot from negotiating with a three-year-old or from their child’s ability to simply say things as they are. When I first started at Amazon my kids would tell people:“Mummy works at the toy shop where the man brings everything to the door.” I love their accurate view of the world.
Other studies on mothers’ brains show that they are less likely to show fear in the face of threat
‘I take a lot of inspiration from the time I spend with my kids and use it at work.’
Helen Nelson is currently enjoying her third maternity leave in five years. The 35-year-old senior clinical scientist hopes to take several months off to spend time with her three daughters — six-month-old Kira, Kaiya, five, and Amane, two — at home in Croydon, Surrey.
Husband Anthony, 37, works full-time as a technician for a business consultancy and, as both parents juggle childcare with the help of nursery and family, Helen admits that the demands of a full-time job and young family can be tough.
Many mothers in her position might consider going part-time or even giving up work completely.
In fact, research suggests that more than 50,000 women a year drop out of the workforce — not always by choice — when they have children.
Parenting website Mumsnet found that two-thirds of mothers felt less employable after having a child and three-quarters said it was harder to progress in their careers.
Being a mother may make you more productive says sociologist Dr Heejung Chung of The University of Kent (file photo)
But Helen, who works for the NHS, feels very differently. ‘I’m definitely going back to work full-time and I’d like to apply for another promotion when I return,’ she says.
‘My professional life has obviously been interrupted by having children. But being a mother has only contributed in a positive way to my career.
‘I’ve applied for promotions while I’m pregnant or on maternity leave and I’ve worked my way up the career ladder. I recently applied for and attained my chartered engineer status — the highest accolade in my industry.
There’s many a parent who has learnt a lot from negotiating with a three-year-old
‘Being a mum means I am more organised than I was pre-children. I’m better at time-management. My hours are 8.30am until 4.30pm, with an hour’s commute each way, but I use that time productively and I’m so much better at switching off when I’m at home.
‘I used to bring work home but now I leave it there so I can focus on my children, reading them a bedtime story or giving them a bath without dealing with emails or calls. Motherhood has made me more confident, too.
‘I remember after having my second daughter that it was quite a shock to the system having two young children under three. But if I could cope with that, I could cope with anything. When I returned to work I noticed that I stood up for myself more. I have to manage people older than myself and I’d find that intimidating if I wasn’t a mother. It’s definitely helped my career.’
Helen credits her employer as one of the reasons why she is able to succeed at work.
In one experiment a U.S. psychologist noted that, when exposed to stress, mother rats were less likely to freeze (file photo)
Experts say employers have to think about offering more flexibility if they want women to stay in the workforce. ‘The pay gap is a productivity gap, representing the loss of women’s skills and expertise from the workforce,’ says Sam Smethers, Chief Executive of the Fawcett Society, the UK’s leading charity campaigning for gender equality and women’s rights.
‘Mothers experience a pay gap of 33 per cent after 12 years. This is largely due to the penalty of taking time out from the labour market and working part-time when they return.
‘By failing to offer flexibility at senior levels, and also failing to create good quality part-time work, employers are simply preventing some of the best candidates from applying or being promoted in those roles.
‘It’s a huge waste of talent and a labour market inefficiency.’
With the right support, mothers can — and do — go on to some of the highest paid jobs in the country. Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of FTSE 250 company Virgin Money UK, returned to work only six weeks after having her daughter Amy, now 16.
She admits she found the sacrifice of working while her husband cared for their baby extremely tough, but surprisingly, her work improved.
‘I had Amy late in life, I was nearly 41, and had endless rounds of IVF,’ says Jayne-Anne, 56, who lives with Amy and retired accountant husband Ashok in Edinburgh.
‘I assumed I could just pack her up and fit her into my schedule. I was wrong. I was hit by terrible post-natal depression.
‘My husband Ash had given up work to look after Amy but I wished he hadn’t. I wanted to be the one at home looking after my baby. I’d fallen hook, line and sinker in love with her and I worried if I wasn’t with her all the time all sorts of awful things would happen. It was a difficult and complicated time, but I did eventually go back.’
Crucially, she adds: ‘I was working at RBS at the time and had a male boss and at my appraisal I had my best bonus rating ever.
‘He said my judgment had improved since I had Amy, because I had something to care about outside of work that gave me a better perspective. That has stuck with me.
‘Being a working mother does not mean you do both jobs worse. Actually, it can make you a better all-rounder and do wonders for your confidence.’
It’s a message that any working mother who feels her career has been compromised by having children should take to heart.

"Sebi headquarters in Mumbai. It is pitiful that the markets regulator can’t bring itself to provide formal guidance on matters that have implications for a number of market participants. Photo: Mint.
Apparently, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has found that ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co. (AMC) Ltd bailed out the ICICI Securities Ltd initial public offering (IPO), and short-changed its unitholders in the process.
The IPO would have devolved if the institutional portion of the IPO book wasn’t fully subscribed. And so, according to a leaked communiqué from Sebi, ICICI’s mutual fund arm put in a last-minute bid of ₹240 crore. It had already bid ₹400 crore on the first day of the book building process, which means its total bids amounted to over 55% of the size of the institutional book. Including the anchor book, the size of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund’s bid was about 22% of the total allotment to institutional investors.
Based on all this, some have concluded that Sebi has an open and shut case. But here is the big problem.
There is no way to confirm any of this because Sebi hasn’t communicated this through an order. It has merely written a letter to ICICI Mutual Fund directing it to return the amount it bid on the last day to the schemes from which the funds came, along with an interest of 15% from the date of allotment of shares.
The letter, a so-called ‘advice to comply’, was leaked to a few journalists, and the above sequence of events is from news reports that rely on it.
Has ICICI Mutual Fund been given an opportunity to present its version or explain? Has it been told which regulations or rules it has violated? What lessons does the episode hold for other fund houses?
We don’t have answers to a plethora of questions that arise, because Sebi, in its wisdom, has chosen to give ICICI Mutual Fund merely some ‘advice’.
Mario Puzo’s Godfather famously said, “I’m going to make him an offer he can’t refuse”. Sebi’s ‘advice to comply’ letter almost sounds like “I’m going to give you advice you can’t refuse”.
Mint reported in 2011 that two mutual fund companies were forced to compensate investors, through similar directives.
Thankfully, securities lawyers say ICICI Prudential AMC can make an appeal against the directive with the Securities Appellate Tribunal. Technically, then, it is advice it can refuse.
In fact, this would be the most logical thing to do. To not protest would amount to a tacit admission that it misused funds deposited by its unitholders to bail out a sister company’s IPO, and ultimately its parent company, which raised ₹3,500 crore by selling shares in the IPO.
The day ICICI Prudential AMC received Sebi’s advice, news reports said another fund house, HDFC Mutual Fund, received directions from the regulator asking it to cancel the shares it allotted to certain distributors ahead of its proposed IPO. It wants the fund house to return the money raised from them and pay 12% interest for the period it has access to the funds.
A report by the Press Trust of India states, “According to industry participants, the distributors, who subscribed to the shares of the fund house, may give biased advice because of their equity stake in HDFC Asset Management Company. This has prompted Sebi to ask the fund house to scrap this pre-IPO placement.”
Should we even discuss the merits of this argument without knowing if this is what led to Sebi’s action? That would be naive, to say the least.
It is pitiful that the markets regulator can’t bring itself to provide formal guidance on matters that have implications for a number of market participants. It sends all sorts of worrying signals.
If it indeed found ICICI Mutual Fund to have violated any of its norms, does it not have the resources to go through with a formal investigation before issuing an order? Or does it believe an order would have been challenged, while ‘advice’ will be complied with?
Whatever the reason, it’s safe to say that this behaviour does not behove the premier regulatory body in the country. Also, note that it’s been over 30 years since Sebi came into being, and this column has repeatedly said that Sebi’s main role now is to ensure good enforcement of its various rules and regulations. In this backdrop, this new-found interest in giving advice, as opposed to issuing orders, is troubling.",www.livemint.com,2018-07-04 23:05:43,36,159343

Migrants from Africa and Asia staged their own version of the World Cup in Moscow on Tuesday, playing soccer matches in Red Square in an event held to highlight challenges faced by refugees in Russia.
The games were organised by anti-discrimination network FARE and the Civic Assistance Committee, which helps migrants and refugees.
Players from Syria, Afghanistan and African countries including Ivory Coast, Congo and Nigeria took part in a series of matches in a FIFA-designated Football Park by the Kremlin walls.
Russia has made efforts during the World Cup to show it is open and does not tolerate discrimination or xenophobia. Despite fears the tournament could be tarnished by racism, no major incident has been reported.
Alexei Smertin, the Russian Football Union’s anti-discrimination inspector, attended and played in the first game.
Immigrants in Russia, particularly from Central Asia, can be targeted for spot document checks by police or suffer racial discrimination. It is difficult for asylum-seekers to obtain refugee status, rights workers say.

Jaguar Land Rover has warned that a ""bad"" Brexit deal would hit its profits and threaten its £80bn investment plans.
The UK's biggest carmaker, owned by India's Tata Motors, said its ""heart and soul is in the UK"".
But it said that without frictionless trade its UK investment plans would be in ""jeopardy"".
The warning comes ahead of a cabinet meeting to finalise a Brexit White Paper on Friday.
Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Ralf Speth said: ""A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than £1.2bn profit each year.
""As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile; we have spent around £50bn in the UK in the past five years - with plans for a further £80bn more in the next five.
""This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.""
Mr Speth said the firm ""urgently need[s] greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK"".
The car maker has about 40,000 UK-based employees.
Brexit campaigner Patrick Minford, chair of Economists for Free Trade, said:
""JLR understandably wants tariff-free trade to continue with the EU after Brexit. So does everybody and this would be achieved once we leave the EU by a straightforward Canada-type, CETA, trade deal.
""There is much nonsense talked about non-tariff barriers and border costs under such a deal.
""These would be illegal. Both the UK and the EU must continue under WTO rules to apply current standards in a non-discriminatory way.""
The Jaguar Land Rover warning follows similar statements from BMW and Airbus.
After those warnings in June, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the threats were ""completely inappropriate"".
""We are in an absolutely critical moment in the Brexit discussions and what that means is that we need to get behind Theresa May to deliver the best possible Brexit,"" he said.
""The more that we undermine Theresa May the more likely we are to end up with a fudge, which would be an absolute disaster for everyone.""",www.bbc.co.uk,2018-07-04 23:05:21,18,369314
"ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar has ordered the construction of Bhasha and Mohmand Dams at the earliest.
In a short judgment read by him in Islamabad on Wednesday, the Chief Justice said water is essential for the survival of people and the country and both dams should be constructed on priority basis.
He said Pakistan is facing an acute shortage of water and this crisis will become worse, if not solved now.
The Chief Justice said nation will have to lend support for construction of dams. Chief Justice said Kalabagh dam can also be constructed with consensus of all.
The Supreme Court sought a report from federal government, WAPDA and other institutions in three weeks’ time regarding construction of dams.
The Chief Justice said a bank account will be opened in the name of Registrar Supreme Court where people can deposit donations for the construction of dams.
Mian Saqib Nisar himself gave donation of one million rupees for this cause.
The Apex Court also constituted a committee headed by Chairman WAPDA for the construction of dams.
During the proceedings, the Attorney General (AG) told the apex court that the general public wanted construction of dams in the country and the court will have release clear orders of construction of dams.
He said that the Council of Common Interest (CCI) had also approved construction of Basha Dam which would have the capacity to store 6.4million acre of water, while Kalabagh Dam would have the storage capacity of 6.1million acre of water.
While giving his remarks, the CJP said that the nation wants to play its part for the construction of dams, adding that the general public is contacting them for the construction of dams and rid the country of its loans.—NNI",aaj.tv,2018-07-04 23:05:05,12,148264

Wipro, while elevating Kohli late last month, promoted four other executives to the rank of senior vice-president, according to an executive familiar with the development.
“Wipro Limited can confirm that Rajan Kohli has been promoted as president, digital, with immediate effect. He will continue to be the global head of Wipro Digital and report to chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala,” said a spokesperson for Wipro.
Kohli is one of the eight presidents at the company, all of them reporting to Neemuchwala.
The company’s chief operating officer, Bhanumurthy Ballapuram; chief human resources officer Saurabh Govil; and the recently appointed head of strategic sales, Anand Padmanabhan, are presidents.
Shaji Farooq, the company’s head of banking and financial services unit; N.S. Bala, the head of energy, natural resources and utilities division; Srini Pallia, the head of consumer business unit; and Milan Rao, the head of the communications business, are also presidents.
Kohli, who took over as head of Wipro Digital in March 2015, has steered it to become a $2 billion business for the company, making the growth of the digital business one of the few success stories at the company.
“Rajan has led the efforts to bring Wipro Digital from zero to $2 billion in a quick three years. We have seen him help clients bridge the gap in not only digital technology but also understanding the digital business models required for success,” said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. “This is recognition of not only Rajan’s efforts to grow $2 billion in Digital but also the importance of Digital in the revenue mix for Wipro,” said Wang.
Over the last few years, Wipro, which ended with $8.06 billion in revenue last year, has struggled for growth and lagged behind its rivals. Noida-based HCL Technologies Ltd is poised to surpass Wipro to become India’s third-biggest software services provider in the current quarter, marking the first change in the pecking order of the country’s $167 billion IT outsourcing industry in six years.",www.livemint.com,2018-07-04 23:03:53,15,159128
"Fiber optic cables usually used to carry internet data could also help warn of impending earthquakes, it has been revealed.
Researchers have successfully used an existing fibre-optic communications cable to monitor seismic activity.
It could lead to radical new methods to monitor large areas.
Scroll down for video
The scientists found that the cable in Iceland not only recorded seismic signals, but were also able to detect the surrounding faults and other underground geological structures.
The study was led by Philippe Jousset of the German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam.
Jousset and his team set up an experiment in Iceland, where fiber-optic cables were transformed into a series of sensors to record both natural and man-made seismic waves.
Researchers setting up the experiment: They used 15km of fibre-optic cable that had originally been installed between two geothermal power plants in Iceland in 1994.
They used 15km of fibre-optic cable that had originally been installed between two geothermal power plants in Iceland in 1994.
A laser pulse sent down a single fibre of the cable was sufficient to determine whether there were any disturbances along its length.
When the ground, and the cable, was stretched or compressed, the team were able to record it.
The scientists found that the cables not only recorded seismic signals, but were also able to detect the surrounding faults and other underground geological structures.
IS CALIFORNIA AT RISK OF A DEVASTATING MEGAQUAKE? A recent report from the U.S. Geological Survey has warned the risk of 'the big one' hitting California has increased dramatically. Researchers analysed the latest data from the state's complex system of active geological faults, as well as new methods for translating these data into earthquake likelihoods. The estimate for the likelihood that California will experience a magnitude 8 or larger earthquake in the next 30 years has increased from about 4.7% to about 7.0%, they say. 'We are fortunate that seismic activity in California has been relatively low over the past century,' said Tom Jordan, Director of the Southern California Earthquake Center and a co-author of the study. Shown above is the chance of an earthquake across California over the next 30 years 'But we know that tectonic forces are continually tightening the springs of the San Andreas fault system, making big quakes inevitable.' Seismologist Lucy Jones from the US Geological Survey warned recently that people need to accept the fact catastrophe is imminent, and prepare themselves accordingly. Dr Jones said our decision to not accept it will only mean more people suffer as scientists warn the 'Big One' is now overdue to hit California. Dr Jones, who is from the US Geological Survey said there are three key reasons why the peril is so frightening - it cannot be seen, it is uncertain and it seems unknowable. This means people bury their heads in the sand and pretend it won't happen.
'Our measurements revealed structural features in the underground with unprecedented resolution and yielded signals equaling data points every four meters', says Jousset.
'This is denser than any seismological network worldwide.'
The scientists also found a previously unknown fault, below the ground surface.
They detected local traffic, seismic shaking and even passing pedestrians.
They also picked up a signal from a strong earthquake in Indonesia.
'We suggest that the networks of fibre-optic telecommunication lines worldwide could be used as seismometers opening a new window for Earth hazard assessment and exploration,' they wrote in Nature.
The advantages of the new method are enormous, they say, as there are countless fibre-optic cables spanning the globe in the dense telecommunication network beneath megacities with high seismic hazards, such as San Francisco, Mexico City, Tokyo, or Istanbul.
HOW ARE EARTHQUAKES MEASURED? The magnitude of an earthquake differs from its intensity. The magnitude of an earthquake refers to the measurement of energy released where the earthquake originated. Magnitude is calculated based on measurements on seismographs. The intensity of an earthquake refers to how strong the shaking that is produced by the sensation is. A 5.3 magnitude earthquake hit the Channel Islands off the coast of southern California on Thursday at 10.30am According to the United States Geological Survey, 'intensity is determined from the effects on people, human structures and the natural environment'. Earthquakes originate below the surface of the earth in a region called the hypocenter. During an earthquake, one part of a seismograph remains stationary and one part moves with the earth's surface. The earthquake is then measured by the difference in the positions of the still and moving parts of the seismograph.
They could provide a cost efficient and widely spread addition to existing seismological measuring devices.
'We only need one strand of a modern fibre-optic line', says Charlotte Krawczyk, Director of GFZ's Geophysics Department.
Future studies are planned to investigate whether deep-sea cables can also be used for seismic measurements.
In an article that accompanied the study, U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist Elizabeth S. Cochran wrote that 'a revolution in seismic detection technology is underway, capturing unprecedented observations of earthquakes and their impacts.'
She said these sensors could give real-time ground-shaking observations that could improve emergency response after damaging earthquakes, and could also advance our understanding of the physics of earthquakes.
'I look forward to a time when smoke detectors and smart gas meters, or even perhaps millions of toasters, provide records useful for seismology,' Cochran said.",www.dailymail.co.uk,2018-07-04 23:03:48,43,259369
"It is a plan as crazy as the situation is desperate - towing an iceberg from Antarctica to Cape Town to supply fresh water to a city in the grip of drought.
Earlier this year, Cape Town came within weeks of shutting off all its taps and forcing residents to queue for water rations at public standpipes.
The cut-off was narrowly averted as people scrambled to reduce their water usage and Autumn rains saved the day. But the threat is expected to return to the coastal South African city again next year and beyond.
""The idea sounds crazy,"" admits maverick salvage expert Nick Sloane, the brains behind the tow-an-iceberg scheme. ""But if you look at the fine details, it is not so crazy.""
Sloane suggests wrapping the iceberg in a textile insulation skirt to stop it melting and using a supertanker and two tugboats to drag it 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) towards Cape Town using prevailing ocean currents.
The iceberg, carefully selected by drones and radiography scans, would be about one kilometer in length, 500 meters across and up to 250 meters deep, with a flat, tabletop surface.
Melted water could be gathered each day using collection channels and a milling machine to create ice slurry - producing 150 million liters of usable water every day for a year.
Purest freshwater on earth
Sloane's idea might be dismissed as mere fantasy.
But the 56-year-old Zambian-South African has a reputation for taking on the impossible after he re-floated the giant Costa Concordia cruise ship that capsized in 2012 off the Tuscan island of Giglio, killing 32 people - one of the world's largest and most complex maritime salvage operations.
""Icebergs are made of the purest freshwater on earth,"" the founder of Sloane Marine Ltd said earnestly.
""Thousands break off every year. Mother Nature has been teasing mankind with this for a long time, saying ‘this is here'.""
He estimates it would cost $100 million to haul an iceberg on a journey that could take up to three months, and another $50-60 million to harvest the water for one year as it melts.
Weighing up options
To tackle the drought, Cape Town has enacted measures ranging from building seawater desalination plants to issuing strict instructions to only flush toilets when necessary.
But whether Cape Town authorities will be persuaded to embrace the iceberg project is unclear.
""At this stage it appears to us that in fact the groundwater or desalination options are cheaper or at least equal cost price,"" said Cape Town's deputy mayor, Ian Neilson.
There are also questions on how the water from the iceberg will be channeled into the city's distribution system.
Another problem is that there is no guarantee that by the time the iceberg is hauled to Cape Town, it will still be able to produce the promised volumes of water.
Sloane's plan is to tow the giant iceberg some 150 km further north to South Africa's St. Helena Bay, where the cold Benguela Current keeps water at around zero degrees Celsius.
Difficult project
Once there, the iceberg could be anchored in an old submarine channel, suggests Sloane.
As the iceberg melts, water will be collected each day, pumped into tankers and driven to Cape Town.
""The project is crazy - no question,"" said Olav Orheim, a Norwegian glaciologist with four decades of experience who is working on a similar project for Saudi Arabia.
Never has such a large iceberg been towed - indeed, the towing of ice to supply drinking water would be a first - and it is unknown if it would withstand ocean currents or simply fracture in transit.
But, said Orheim, it was no longer unrealistic ""because we know so much more now than when we started this kind of research 40 years ago.""
""It is a high risk project, but also (one) which may have a very high reward at the end,"" said Orheim.",www.dailysabah.com,2018-07-04 23:03:25,27,198084
"A quick look at Wimbledon:
LOOKAHEAD TO THURSDAY
Rafael Nadal owns 17 Grand Slam titles, including two at Wimbledon. Novak Djokovic has won 12 majors, three at the All England Club. Both are scheduled to play in the second round Thursday against opponents with no such hardware on their resumes. The No. 2-seeded Nadal will open the day's schedule at Centre Court against 77th-ranked Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan, who has been as far as the fourth round at a major exactly once and lost his opening matches at the Australian Open and French Open this year. Nadal has won all three of their previous matchups. Djokovic, a former No. 1 who is seeded 12th, can become only the fifth man in the professional era to collect 60 wins at Wimbledon, by beating 126th-ranked Horacio Zeballos of Argentina on No. 2 Court. Zeballos has only once been past the second round at a Grand Slam tournament, getting to the fourth round at the 2017 French Open. Plus, Djokovic has never lost to someone ranked as low as Zeballos at a major and is 1-0 in their lone head-to-head meeting. Another Grand Slam champion in action on Day 4 is 2009 U.S. Open winner Juan Martin del Potro, facing Feliciano Lopez, who is participating in his record 66th consecutive major.

England will face their toughest World Cup test against Sweden in the quarter-finals, a task more daunting than taking on tournament favourites Brazil, former England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said. England booked their place in the last eight by edging past Colombia in a penalty shootout on Tuesday to raise hopes of a first World Cup title since 1966.
“It would be easier for England to beat Brazil than to beat Sweden in my opinion, Sweden today are a very hard team to break down,” Swede Eriksson, who led England to the 2002 and 2006 World Cup quarter-finals, told Paddy Power News.
“England have a great chance to make a World Cup semi-final. But, if anyone in the squad thinks they have an easy game on Saturday, they’re wrong. It’ll be the most difficult game they have played so far, they can bet on that.”
Sweden reached the World Cup last eight for the first time since finishing third in 1994 after a scrappy 1-0 victory over Switzerland on Tuesday.
“Sweden are so difficult to break down. They are very solid and really tough. If you woke them up in the middle of the night, they would know every position in defending – any possibility in the game, they know what to do.”
He added, “Their strikers are defenders when it’s time to defend and they can defend in their own box as well. During my time with England we met them four times. We lost once, and the others were a draw and, going back before that, Sweden have beaten England in big games. My brain says England, though my heart says Sweden.”
England had never won a penalty shootout at the World Cup before Tuesday and Eriksson believes overcoming that barrier will prove to be a big boost in the latter stages of the tournament. “Everyone gets worried when a game goes to penalties, and with the record England have in competitions, it’s huge in England that they’ve managed to win the shootout here… it’s great for confidence because of England’s history,” he said.

Global nanobiotechnology market: Increasing demand for nanobiotechnology in stem cell therapy
Stem cells have the potential to develop into different cell types during early life and function as internal repair systems that divide to replenish other cells in the human body. Stem cells include embryonic stem cells and non-embryonic adult stem cells that are unspecialized cells. Advances in stem cell research reveal the potential of stem cells that can change the way the diseases are perceived and treated.
“At present, thousands of clinical trials around the world involve some form of stem cell therapy as there is a lack of complete understanding of the fate of the transplanted cells and their distribution after injection. Traditionally, the monitoring of therapies is led by histological analysis that is laborious and invasive and involves multiple tissue biopsies,” says a senior analyst at Technavio for research on health and wellness.

"Image caption Mark Field said he thought the nomination was a scam
An ""inspirational"" nurse who uses boxing to help people overcome mental health problems has won an award.
Mark Field, from Connah's Quay, Flintshire, gave up a career in the sport because of health problems and trained as a psychiatric nurse.
For more than 20 years he has combined his gym skills and mental health training to help young people.
Mr Field received the Royal College of Nursing (RCNi) special recognition award at Park Plaza in London.
He was chosen from more than 700 entries for his work at Buckley Amateur Boxing Club to give young people a secure environment to manage their mental health issues.
'Above and beyond'
Mr Field and his team encourage young people with ADHD, bipolar and depression to use the sport to overcome issues such as low confidence and self-esteem.
Rachel Armitage, managing director at RCNi, described him as ""a magnificent example of a nurse who has gone above and beyond in his specialism"" and said she hopes he inspires others to consider a career in nursing.

While he has been at the club, Mr Field said many of the more than 200 members had found boxing helped them cope with a range of emotional and psychological issues.
He was diagnosed with depression and bipolar himself when he was forced to quit boxing 23 years ago when a cyst was discovered on his brain.
Mr Field went back to university, trained as a psychiatric nurse and now works in adult mental health in Chester.
When he received the award nomination, he said: ""I thought it was a scam.""

"Shriram Transport Finance fell over 19% during the day, before closing 11.83% lower at ₹1,144.85 on Wednesday.
Mumbai: Shares of Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd tanked on Wednesday after its annual report revealed a large corporate guarantee to a group holding company.
Shriram Transport Finance fell over 19% during the day, before closing 11.83% lower at ₹1,144.85.
The company’s 2017-18 annual report showed that it has an outstanding corporate guarantee of ₹870 crore to SVL Ltd, formerly Shriram Industrial Holdings Ltd, the unlisted holding company of non-financial businesses of the Shriram group.
SVL had issued ₹650 crore of zero coupon non-convertible debentures (NCDs) in June 2015, maturing on 28 June 2019. Outstanding guarantee of ₹870 crore as on 18 March includes accrued interest, disclosure around the guarantee. SVL invests in infrastructure, engineering procurement and construction and renewable power.
Analysts said the balance sheet exposure is a potential risk. “With SVL/subsidiaries likely under financial stress, NCD repayment may be an issue. Other group companies could aid in repayment, but if guarantee is invoked and liability devolves on Shriram Transport Finance Ltd, its book value may be hit by 4-5%. Additional provision may be needed under IndAS, but we await clarity,” said Jefferies in a note on 3 July.
However, Jefferies has retained buy rating on the stock, though the company’s non-funded exposure is a negative. The research firm is also constructive on its commercial vehicles outlook. It believes strong loan growth, stable net interest margin and falling credit costs should drive 42% EPS CAGR and 80bps return on asset (ROA) expansion over FY18-20.
According to Morgan Stanley, the exposure could hurt its FY19 earnings per share (EPS) by up to 21% and increase FY19 credit costs by up to 85 basis points. It warned that this could delay the earnings recovery and re-rating at the stock, which could weigh on the stock’s near-term performance.
“Shriram EPC has been referred to NCLT and, hence, there is a meaningful risk of this balance sheet exposure becoming a liability for Shriram Transport Finance Company…We await more clarity from the company on the exposure and potential coping measures. IND AS reporting beginning Q1FY19 should likely help crystallise the impact as early as Q1FY19,” Morgan Stanley said in a note on 3 July.
Meanwhile, the company said in a press statement that apart from this corporate guarantee, it has not extended any fresh guarantee for SVL Ltd and the corporate guarantee is secured by pledge of shares of SVL Ltd. It added that the guarantee was duly approved by the board of directors of Shriram Transport Finance and was appropriately disclosed in the documents available in public domain.
“The promoters of Shriram Transport Finance Company are also addressing the above with SVL Group to get the settlement of dues on or before the due date, failing which, the promoters/promoter group of our company will address through alternate mechanisms to settle the dues,” the company statement said.",www.livemint.com,2018-07-04 23:01:28,21,158685
"Teenage French striker Kylian Mbappe has been setting the World Cup alight with his searing pace and goal-scoring prowess, marking him out as a NextGen superstar of the sport.
BONDY, France: Teenage French striker Kylian Mbappe has been setting the World Cup alight with his searing pace and goal-scoring prowess, marking him out as a NextGen superstar of the sport.
Back in his hometown of Bondy, on the gritty northeast outskirts of Paris, there is immense pride at his exploits, but not that much surprise - they always knew he'd make it big.

The 19-year-old, who scored twice in France's come-from-behind 4-3 victory over Argentina, sending Les Bleus into the quarter-finals, is a well-known figure in the suburb, where he grew up playing at local club AS Bondy.
""Kylian was ahead of everybody,"" recalls Jean-Marc Goue, 28, a friend of Mbappe's older brother and a special education teacher in the neighbourhood, which has a large population of migrants from central and north Africa.
""At age five, he used to listen to his father (an AS Bondy coach) speaking in the locker rooms and his bedroom was plastered with pictures of Zidane and Ronaldo,"" he said.
But the young sensation, who joined AS Monaco at the age of 14, never lost touch with his roots or let success go to his head - even after he transferred to Paris Saint-Germain in 2018 for a reported 145 million euro fee.

His father, originally from Cameroon, and his mother, a handball player from Algeria, instilled in him a drive to give back to the community, which sits between two highways amid several decayed housing projects. In France the area is often referred to dismissively by its department number - 93.
""It is fairly easy for fame and money to get to your head, but Kylian is different,"" said Goue. ""He knows where he comes from thanks to his family. He is a source of pride to the kids in Bondy, a role-model.""
Last month, Mbappe helped finance a trip to Russia for a group of students from a local school, College Jean Renoir.
During their 10-day trip, the 25 teenagers visited Moscow and attended the Morocco vs Portugal and France vs Denmark matches, including meeting Mbappe during the visit.
For Nassyn, a 13-year-old who was on the trip, the soccer star is living proof that ""anything is possible"" despite coming from a suburb that is often stigmatized because of its large migrant population and high level of unemployment.
While Mbappe is discreet about his charitable giving, and hasn't sought to play up French media reports that he has waived his match fees at the World Cup, giving the money a charity instead, those in Bondy feel his impact.
Mickael Ichkhanian, the former groundskeeper at the Leo Lagrande stadium, where Mbappe made his debut, said the community was fortunate to have such a son, one who displays a maturity beyond his years on and off the pitch.
""The fact that he comes from the 93, which is often negatively portrayed by the media, just makes us even more proud,"" he said.

Five-times Wimbledon champion Venus Williams dropped her opening service game and lost the first set before finding her rhythm to beat qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru 4-6 6-0 6-1 in the second round on Wednesday.
LONDON: Five-times Wimbledon champion Venus Williams dropped her opening service game and lost the first set before finding her rhythm to beat qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru 4-6 6-0 6-1 in the second round on Wednesday.
The 38-year-old American brought her experience to bear from the second set to seal a comfortable win in her first meeting with the Romanian.

""It's just credit to her, she played very well and took advantage, you have to at these championships,"" Venus said of Dulgheru's first-set performance.
""It's not easy to play someone you haven’t played, and I’m sure she’s seen me play a lot, so she was extremely competitive,"" she added.
Dulgheru, world number 141, came out fighting in the deciding set, won her serve and had two break points for the second game, only for Venus to save both and hold.
Asked about her improved performance from the second set and whether it confirmed her form as she seeks a second consecutive final and sixth title, she said: ""It's just about winning a match, whether it's your best (tennis) or not doesn't matter.""

"Switzerland will continue discussions on its ties with the European Union after the summer break, the country's government said on Wednesday, delaying an agreement between the two sides for a new treaty.
ZURICH: Switzerland said on Wednesday it had put further talks on a new treaty governing relations with the European Union, including sensitive labour market rules, on hold until after the summer break.
Negotiations to formalise ties now covered by around 100 separate accords have stumbled in recent weeks with Swiss leaders conceding that Britain's planned exit from the EU has made it more difficult to clinch a deal.

Talks have snagged in particular on Switzerland's wish to protect its own labour market and the pay and conditions for Swiss-based workers, with Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis describing this as a ""red line"" not up for negotiation.
Brussels has said Switzerland must agree a full treaty before it gets greater access to EU markets.
Progress has been made towards resolving several points of contention, particularly on the solution of legal disputes through arbitration panels, the Swiss government said.
But open questions remain in the areas surrounding the free movement of people, it added, particularly measures to protect the pay and conditions of workers in Switzerland.

The Swiss government wants to carry out deeper discussion with the country's semi-autonomous cantons and groups like trade unions to resolve differences before talks resume, he said.
Brussels is pushing Bern to agree a treaty this year before elections in Switzerland and the EU scheduled for 2019.
It has warned it will not grant the Swiss more access to the EU's 28-nation single market - the biggest for Swiss exports - in the absence of an ""institutional agreement"".
Cassis refused to be rushed, saying the government was prepared to let a deadline on the current talks lapse.
""The Federal Council (Swiss cabinet) considers the internal political situation to be more important than the timetable. Quality comes before timing,"" he said.
""Either the agreement fits qualitatively...or it doesn't, and Switzerland presses forward,"" he said, adding Switzerland could re-examine the issue later.
The EU on Wednesday characterised the talks as ""difficult.""
""We take note of today's discussions,"" a spokeswoman for the European Commission said. ""Negotiations will continue next week and they will remain difficult.""

"The govt can strengthen the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2008, to ensure intermediaries comply with the law and remove ‘offensive’ content. Photo: AFP
What should a government do when fake online messages and rumours incite mobs to lynch people? On 4 July, the government responded by conveying its “deep disapproval” to WhatsApp and urged it to “take accountability and responsibility” for the spread of “fake and provocative messages” through its platform.
While WhatsApp issued a response, saying “we don’t want our services used to spread harmful misinformation..”, it added that, “WhatsApp cares deeply about people’s safety and their ability to freely communicate”. It’s this part that makes the government’s resolve to pressure WhatsApp, which has 200 million monthly active users in the country, into submission. It’s a double-edged sword, and is easier said than implemented.
The dilemma is similar to the ban Blackberry faced in 2010 over its BBM messaging service. It was forced to dilute its encryption to allow the government to read BBM messages, ostensibly in a bid to counter terrorist propaganda and other rumours. WhatsApp, on its part, uses the Signal Protocol, designed by Open Whisper Systems, as the basis for its encryption that is designed to prevent third parties and WhatsApp itself from accessing messages and calls.
To counter this, say experts, the government can strengthen the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2008, to ensure intermediaries comply with the law and remove “offensive” content. However, if the government does so, there could be a backlash over monitoring of private messages and uproar over social media networks sharing private data with governments.
From a legal angle, too, WhatsApp does not have a data server in India, so it is not bound by the laws of the country. “WhatsApp is choosing not to comply with Indian laws because it is governed by US laws. The government, on its part, can without approaching Parliament, come up with a rule under Section 87 of the IT Act, 2008, to regulate intermediaries,” says Pavan Duggal, Supreme Court advocate and president, Cyberlaws.net.
According to Duggal, WhatsApp needs to remove offensive content the moment it’s notified. “Besides enforcing Section 79 read with Section 85 (both deal with offensive posts and regulating intermediaries), India needs a Fake News Law too,” he suggests. Duggal adds that India needs to “determine punishments” for non-enforcement of such laws and also “make cyberlaw part of a school’s curriculum” to create more awareness.
On the other hand, Sunil Abraham, founder of think tank Centre for Internet and Society (CIS), believes that WhatsApp is facing the “technological moral panic”.
“Whenever there is a new technology, people tend to blame it for misuse. Even if you ban WhatsApp, users will move to other platforms, which the government will find even more difficult to control,” he explains. He suggests that WhatsApp have a “single click fact-checking feature”. This will allow a fact checker to instantly provide a user a “low-truth or high-truth score”.",www.livemint.com,2018-07-04 23:00:50,22,158908
"Federer, Serena rip Wimbledon rivals
2 SHARES Share Tweet
LONDON (AFP) – Eight-time champion Roger Federer and seven-time winner Serena Williams shrugged off 30-degree heat to breeze into the Wimbledon second round Monday.
Federer, the defending champion and seeking a 21st major, marked the start of his 20th successive Wimbledon with a new look and a comfortable 6-1, 6-3, 6-4 win over Serbia’s Dusan Lajovic.
Williams, like Federer, 36-years-old but chasing a 24th Slam title, enjoyed a hard-fought 7-5, 6-3 victory over Holland’s Arantxa Rus.
It was the American’s first match at the All England Club since lifting the 2016 title.
She missed the 2017 edition as she prepared for the birth of her first child.
Top seed Federer marched out on Centre Court dressed for the first time in gear designed by Japanese giant Uniqlo in a deal reported to be worth $300 million after a two-decade association with Nike.
But everything else was familiar for the Swiss star who cruised past world number 57 Lajovic in just 79 minutes.
It was the second successive year that Federer had knocked out the Serb at Wimbledon.
Out on Court One, Serena, seeded 25 this year despite a ranking of 181, had too much power for Rus, the world 107.
US Open champion and fourth seed Sloane Stephens became the tournament’s first big name casualty when she slumped to a 6-1, 6-3 loss to Croatia’s world 55 Donna Vekic.
For Stephens, fresh from making the French Open final last month, it was her second successive first round loss at the tournament.
“There isn’t too much I can do – I’m not going to go and cry. Life goes on,’’ said Stephens, who was followed out of the tournament by Bulgarian sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov.
The 2014 semi-finalist was stunned by three-time Slam winner Stan Wawrinka 1-6, 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/5), 6-4.
Wawrinka, whose ranking has slumped to 225 after knee surgery, had lost his last four matches against Dimitrov.
But at the same tournament where he played what proved to be his last match of 2017, the 33-year-old was rejuvenated.
‘’It’s a great feeling to win like this on Centre Court,’’ said Wawrinka, twice a quarter-finalist at Wimbledon.

"Union Information and Technolgy Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday told the WhatsApp that identifying mass circulation of fake messages is not rocket science. On the sidelines of a conference in New Delhi, Prasad asked social media platforms like WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook to remain accountable, responsible and vigilant.
A day after Supreme Court said states are bound to check incidents of mob lynchings, Union Information and Technolgy Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday told the WhatsApp that identifying mass circulation of fake messages is not rocket science. The minister in the Modi government said that his department’s initial probe has found that disinformation and provocative messages on WhatsApp played a major role in instigating violence. Prasad further asked the social media platforms like WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook to remain accountable, responsible and vigilant.
On the sidelines of a conference in New Delhi, Prasad said, “If in any state, any part, on a particular subject, if there is a movement of large volumes of messages on WhatsApp, it is not rocket science that can’t be discovered by application of technology.”
He said that the government has issued a notice to social messaging platform WhatsApp in this matter. Quoting WhatsApp reply to the government, he said the social media application has made changes to its setting, now a group admin can decide who can send messages.
In its reply, WhatsApp has informed the government that they are trying to see that messages aren’t forwarded without reading and understanding. The WhatsApp said it is horrified by the recent mob lynchings incidents triggered by fake messages. The minister also appreciated the WhatsApp over the decision taken by them to check fake messages.
Issuing a stern action to the Facebook-owned application, the government recently told WhatsApp that it should immediately stop fake messages on its application that are impacting law and order situation in the country. The recent developments have come days after five people were lynched in Dhule district of Maharashtra over suspicion of child lifters.

"The move is part of a series of initiatives taken to eliminate drug menace from Punjab
Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh today ordered mandatory dope test for all government employees, including police personnel, from the time of their recruitment through every stage of their service.
The chief minister has directed the Chief Secretary to work out the modalities and issue necessary notification in this regard, an official spokesperson said here.
The chief minister has ordered drug screening to be mandatory in all cases of recruitment and promotions, as well as the annual medical examination that certain employees are required to undergo in accordance with the nature of their duties.
Dope test would be made mandatory for all recruitments as well as promotions to be made by various Punjab government departments, according to the spokesperson.
Further, dope test would also be made a mandatory part of the Annual Medical examination of all civilian/police employees of the Punjab government, wherever prescribed, he added.
The move is part of a series of initiatives taken by the chief minister over the past three days to eliminate the drug menace from Punjab.
The orders comes on a day the chief minister formally communicated his Cabinet's recommendation to the Centre, seeking amendment to the NDPS Act to provide for death penalty for first-time offenders too.
Mr Singh has already issued a strict warning to drug smugglers and peddlers to give up their nefarious activities or face stringent action.

"Wealth management and investment group Tilney is eyeing “acquisition opportunities” after hailing a record year and a solid contribution from its Scottish operations.
The group said its underlying earnings had doubled in the last year to £86.6 million while revenues grew by 68 per cent to £226.5m.
Gross new inflows were up by 62 per cent to a record £3.21bn and the firm highlighted assets under management (AUM) of about £24.1bn, a rise of 60 per cent.
During the period, Tilney completed the integration of Towry Group and pushed ahead with the roll-out of a “major new technology platform”.
The firm, which has Scottish operations in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow, said it will look to augment growth with new hires and “potential acquisition opportunities”.
Chief executive Chris Woodhouse said: “2017 was another record year for Tilney with our average AUM up 60 per cent year-on-year and ending 2017 at over £24bn.
“Importantly, we saw a 62 per cent increase in gross new business, demonstrating our ability to grow organically as well as by acquisitions.
“With our past acquisitions of Towry and Ingenious Asset Management now fully integrated, our scalable business model delivered a doubling of [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, or Ebitda] to £86.6m whilst growing our Ebitda margin up to 43 per cent.”
He added: “The wealth management profession has, of course, had to respond to a considerable amount of new regulation in recent years and that is a particular challenge for such a fragmented profession.
“Against this backdrop the benefits of scale are becoming increasingly apparent. We will continue to look to accelerate our growth further through both hires of talented financial planners and investment managers who see the attractions of our model as well as exploring potential acquisition opportunities where the fit is right.”
Paul Frame, the firm’s head of Scotland, said: “Tilney has grown to become one of the largest wealth managers operating in Scotland… where we manage or advise on circa £3.5bn of assets on behalf of private investors and charities.”
“We see excellent potential to grow further in Scotland given the strong demand for expert advice created on the one hand by increased tax and pension complexity and on the other the need to navigate increasingly uncertain investment markets.”",www.scotsman.com,2018-07-04 23:00:00,10,235047
"Why Kenyans root for Sweden in Russia 2018

When Sweden take on England on Saturday in Samara in the third quarterfinal a section of Kenyans will be rooting for two Swedish players they consider their own.
John Guidetti, who spent five years of his formative ages kicking about the ball with kids from the slums of Nairobi and Martin Tony Waikwa Olsson, will be close to the hearts of a few Kenyans who know them.
Guidetti arrived in Kenya in 2002 aged 10 and says his experiences have since shaped his view of life and professional football.
“That period was very important for my development, both on and off the pitch. I played football barefoot in the slum areas of Nairobi and I came into contact with local people and their culture. I still have a strong link with Kenya and every time I go back there I always get a warm welcome,” Guidetti was quoted as saying.
A picture of a white boy in the midst of Kenyan teammates keep popping up in social media, often with an outpouring of love of the lad who would grow to play for Sweden.
The Swedes are known for their robust display backed with a never-say-die mentality, an ingredient that Guidetti may have just found in abundance in Nairobi slums.

Now plying his trade with Deportivo Alaves of Spain, Guidetti started off his journey to stardom at Impala and had a stint at Mathare Youth Sports Association and thereafter Ligi Ndogo off Ngong Road.
Guidetti’s mental strength has helped earn him a slot in fiery coach Janne Andersson’s squad despite a topsy-turvy career that once took him to Manchester City.
Also in Andersson’s squad to face England will be Martin Tony Waikwa Olsson of Swansea City.
The left-back almost earned Sweden a penalty after replacing Emil Forsberg only for the VAR officials to rule it out.
Little is know about Olsson who was born in Gavle Sweden in 1988 to a Kenyan mother, Maggie Waikwa from Kangemi, Nairobi, but now deceased.
Olsson once told Walesonline: “I am very proud of my heritage, my mother passed away a few years ago but we were brought up in that culture and I am proud of being Swedish and being Kenyan.”
“We have family in Nairobi, Mombasa is where we used to live, and we have family in Nanyuki about two hours away.
“My cousins are there and they watch the games on TV, so Swansea City have fans in Kenya cheering them on,” said Olsson whose twin brother Marcus Munuhe Olsson plays for Derby County in England.",www.standardmedia.co.ke,2018-07-04 22:59:35,17,502925

"New Delhi, July 4: The Supreme Court on Wednesday clarified that Puducherry cannot be compared with the case of Delhi as it is governed by a provision which is different from that concerning the national capital.
The top court said that the case of Puducherry even stood on a different footing from the Union Territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Lakshadweep and Chandigarh.
It said that Puducherry was covered under Article 239A whereas NCT of Delhi is covered under Article 239AA.
Interestingly, Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy, who is enaged in a running feud with LG Kiran Bedi, had hailed the apex court verdict saying it was ""totally applicable"" to the southern Union Territory too.
The veteran Congress leader has also warned that he would file a contempt petition if the Lt Governor failed to act in accordance with the apex court verdict.
A five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra analysed the provisions of Article 239A which governs Puducherry.
Highlighting the difference between Delhi and Puducherry, the bench held ""At the outset, we must declare that the insertion of Articles 239AA and 239AB which specifically pertain to NCT of Delhi is reflective of the intention of the Parliament to accord Delhi a sui generis status from the other Union Territories as well as from the Union Territory of Puducherry to which Article 239A is singularly applicable as on date"".
With regard to Puducherry, the bench said that Article 239A gives the discretion to Parliament to create a Council of Ministers and/or a body which may either be wholly elected or partly elected and partly nominated to perform the functions of a legislature.
It said that the Article was brought into force by the Constitution (14th Amendment) Act, 1962. Prior to 1971, under Article 239A, Parliament had the power to create legislatures or Council of Ministers for the then Union territories of Himachal Pradesh, Tripura, Manipur, Goa and Daman and Diu.
""On January 25, 1971, Himachal Pradesh acquired statehood and consequently, was omitted from Article 239A. Subsequently, on January 21, 1972, Tripura and Manipur were granted statehood as a consequence of which both Manipur and Tripura were omitted from Article 239A"", the bench, also comprising Justices A K Sikri, A M Khanwilkar, D Y Chandrachud and Ashok Bhushan, said.
Similarly with the enactment for Goa, Daman and Diu Reorganisation Act on May 30, 1987, both Goa and Daman and Diu were also omitted from scheme of Article 239A.
""Parliament, under the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, created legislatures for the then Union Territories and accordingly, even after May 30, 1987, the applicability of Article 239A stands limited to UT of Puducherry,"" it said.
The bench said as a natural corollary, the Union Territory of Puducherry stands on a different footing from other UTs.

"LONDON (AP) - Austrian qualifier Dennis Novak is through to the third round at Wimbledon, with a little help from the Thiem family.
The 171st-ranked Novak defeated 17th-seeded Lucas Pouille 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (8), 3-6, 6-2 on Wednesday to double his Grand Slam win tally.
Novak, in the main draw at the All England Club for the first time, trains alongside French Open runner-up Dominic Thiem and is coached by his countryman's father, Wolfgang.

""We speak a lot and I think he's played almost against everyone already,"" Novak said of Dominic, who quit his first-round match at Wimbledon with a back injury. ""So I ask him for advice if he can tell me something about the players.""
The tips on Pouille appeared accurate as Novak raced into a two-set lead in less than an hour.
However, after saving two match points in the third set tiebreaker, the Frenchman found his rhythm, hitting 15 winners in the fourth set to level.
Novak's self-belief was brought under further scrutiny when he allowed Pouille to cancel out an early break at the beginning of the fifth set, but the Austrian rallied to win four games in a row and seal victory in just short of three hours.
In the back of his mind were the words of encouragement he has received from seventh-ranked Thiem.
""He just tells me he knows how good I can play, and he really believes in me, and that's what makes me feel really good and comfortable,"" Novak said.
Novak, who made his Grand Slam debut in a first round defeat to Grigor Dimitrov at the Australian Open earlier this season, is playing the fourth grass-court tournament of his career.
His ranking prevented him from entering second-tier, let alone ATP, warmup events for Wimbledon, but having come through three rounds of qualifying in London, Novak is taking a liking to the surface.
""I don't know if I'm a specialist but I think my game is OK for grass,"" Novak said. ""I return good, I have a flat backhand and I serve good.""
His next challenge is a matchup with 2016 runner-up Milos Raonic, who at 147mph (236kph), delivered the second fastest serve in Wimbledon history as he advanced in straight sets against John Millman.
""I know he's around Dominic Thiem quite a bit, I think they train together,"" Raonic said. ""I know I haven't seen him play... I have 48 hours to learn as much as I can.""
Raonic's best preparation might be recalling what Thiem's tactics were last time he faced him.

""Now that the kids have been found, we can relax a little, and we can consider other plans,"" Narongsak Osotthanakorn, commander of the search and rescue mission and governor of Chiang Rai province where the cave is located, told a press briefing, dpa reported. Narongsak's remark followed a local news report citing a tourism official about the plan.
""After the rescue team found the 12 football players and their coach on Monday night, the cave has become of interest for both local and foreign travelers,"" Karuna Dechatiwong, tourism governor for Chiang Rai province, told the Bangkok Post.

Tham Luang-Khun Nam Nang Non Cave is Thailand's fourth longest cave, stretching for 10 kilometers and located some 1,000 kilometers north of Bangkok near the border with Myanmar. It is a little known and barely-explored site due to its difficult terrain.
It remains unclear when the group will be brought out of the cave after they were discovered by British divers late Monday. Rescue teams were giving crash courses in swimming and diving as part of complex preparations to extract a young soccer squad trapped in a cave and hoping for a swift end to their harrowing 11-day ordeal.
Divers, medics, counselors and Thai navy SEALS were with the 12 schoolboys and their 25-year-old coach, providing medicines and food, while experts assessed conditions for getting them out safely, a task the government said would not be easy.""

"Philippine soldiers backed by armored vehicles have retaken a southern town held for 12 hours by pro-Daesh militants, the army said yesterday, with four rebels killed in urban clashes reminiscent of a five-month siege last year. The clashes followed warnings by President Rodrigo Duterte that remnants of pro-Daesh militant groups had been recruiting and still planning attacks on several southern cities to set up an independent and separate Islamic state.
Troops pursued militants from the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) group, who fled to the hills after trying to occupy a marshland town, Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Cabunoc, an army battalion commander, said in a statement. The military will continue to ""disrupt the BIFF's plan to sow terror in communities"" in the troubled south, Cabunoc said.
Hundreds of residents have remained in shelter areas and not been allowed to return home after troops retrieved improvised explosive devices and other booby traps in the town of Datu Paglas. The army said the Datu Paglas attack could be a test case, since the area was near the militants' marshland base.
Since March, the military has shifted its combat operations from Marawi, a battered lakeside town in Mindanao embroiled in last year's five-month conflict, to the island's marshes where other pro-Daesh militants operate. More than 40 BIFF militants have been killed in the last four months by troops in air and ground assaults the military described as preemptive moves to thwart militant attacks on cities.",www.dailysabah.com,2018-07-04 22:57:21,8,197922

The Senate President, Bukola Saraki has described the arrest of Senator Eyinnaya Abaribe as unfortunate.
Senator Abaribe was arrested by the Department of State Security (DSS) in Abuja on Friday, June 22, 2018.
According to the lawmaker’s lawyer, Chukwuma-Machukwu Ume (SAN), the DSS arrested his client for supporting the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB).
Ume also said that Senator Abaribe was accused of gun running.
Sacrifice for Nigeria’s democracy
Speaking further on the issue, Saraki said that the lawmaker’s arrest was part of the sacrifice for the nation’s democracy.
According to the Senate President, “Distinguished Sen. Abaribe, we are all happy to see that you are back. It was an unfortunate situation that we hope that things will definitely restore back normal in all these issues that concerns you.
“It is one of these sacrifices unfortunately that we all have to make in deepening our democracy.”
Abaribe had earlier raised a point of Order during plenary to narrate his ordeal in detention.
He said “I have been deluged by Nigerians especially my colleagues who have been very worried about the reports that came up regarding my arrest by men of the DSS.
“I crave your indulgence Mr president and that of my colleagues that yes1, that on Friday 22, June, I was arrested at the gate of the Hilton hotel while the international press institute congress was going on. I was taken to the office of the DSS by 11.30 in the morning and subsequently by 5 pm I was taken to my house for a search of my residence.
“When we got to my house, that was the point at which I was now formally informed of why I was arrested because the search warrant that was used stated clearly that I’m being accused with aiding and sponsoring a proscribed organisation, IPOB and so that the search of my house was to look for evidence of such.
“After the search which took another 5 to 6 hours, I was talking to the office of the DSS about 12 midnight and now kept there.
“I have been released through the intervention of all well meaning Nigerians led by you and the leadership of the Senate, so Iam very glad and grateful and want to use this opportunity yo thank all Nigerians who were concerned and who did everything to secure my release.
“Nothing has been found for the allegations that were made. Uptill this moment, iam still on bail, administrative bail by the DSS. Every morning I have to report to the DSS but of course these things are going to be challenged in the court of law.

“Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the president or any other public official, save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the president or anyone else.

"The Trump administration said Tuesday the government would no longer encourage schools to use race as a factor in the admissions process, rescinding Obama-era guidance meant to promote diversity among students.
The shift gives colleges the federal government's blessing to leave race out of admissions and enrollment decisions and underscores the contentious politics that for decades have surrounded affirmation action policies, which have repeatedly been challenged before the Supreme Court.
The Obama administration memos encouraging schools to take race into account were among 24 policy documents revoked by the Justice Department for being ""unnecessary, outdated, inconsistent with existing law, or otherwise improper."" Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the changes an effort to restore the ""rule of law,"" though civil rights groups decried the move and some universities said they intended to continue their diversity efforts as before.
The actions comes amid a high-profile court fight over Harvard University admissions that has attracted the government's attention, as well as Supreme Court turnover expected to produce a more critical eye toward schools' race-conscious admissions policies.
The court's most recent significant ruling on the subject bolstered colleges' use of race among many factors in the admission process. But the opinion's author, Anthony Kennedy, announced his retirement last week, giving President Donald Trump a chance to replace him with a justice who may be more reliably skeptical of admissions programs that take race and ethnicity into account.
The new policy dramatically departs from the stance of the Obama administration, which said schools could consider race in admissions decisions. In one 2011 policy document, the administration said courts had recognized schools' ""compelling interest"" in ensuring racially diverse populations on campuses.
""Institutions are not required to implement race-neutral approaches if, in their judgment, the approaches would be unworkable,"" the guidance said. ""In some cases, race-neutral approaches will be unworkable because they will be ineffective to achieve the diversity the institution seeks.""
That guidance has now been rescinded, as have about a half-dozen similar documents, including some that sought to explain court rulings affirming the use of race to make admissions decisions.
In one such document, the Obama administration stated, ""As the Supreme Court has recognized, diversity has benefits for all students, and today's students must be prepared to succeed in a diverse society and an increasingly global workforce.""
The Trump administration's announcement is more in line with Bush-era policy that discouraged affirmative action and instead encouraged the use of race-neutral alternatives, like percentage plans and economic diversity programs. Though such guidance doesn't have the force of law, schools could presumably use it to defend themselves against lawsuits over admission policies.
The high court has been generally accepting of considering race in admissions decisions to achieve diversity. In a 2016 opinion written by Kennedy, the court granted affirmative action policies a victory by permitting race to be among the factors considered in the college admission process.
The ruling bitterly disappointed conservatives who thought Kennedy would be part of a Supreme Court majority to outlaw affirmative action in education. Justice Antonin Scalia died after the court heard arguments in the case but before the decision was handed down. The new affirmative action guidance may add to an already contentious fight over the next justice.",www.dailysabah.com,2018-07-04 22:57:08,20,197921
"Renowned Dutch cinematographer Robby Muller, who shot some of the best-known films of Wim Wenders, Jim Jarmusch and Lars Von Trier, died in Amsterdam on Wednesday. Muller was 78 and was suffering from vascular dementia. He is survived by his wife, Andrea.
Muller’s credits include some of German director Wim Wenders’s early masterworks, including the road trilogy comprising Alice in the Cities (1974), The Wrong Move (1975) and Kings of the Road (1976), American Friend (1977) and Paris, Texas (1984).
Play Paris, Texas (1984).
Muller’s first feature film in 1970 was also Wenders’s first: the black-and-white Summer in the City. Muller, who was born on April 4, 1940, in Curacao, moved to Amsterdam aged 13 and later studied at the Netherlands Film Academy. Apart from his fruitful collaboration with Wenders, which gave an early indication of his imaginative and highly mobile camerawork and use of colours and textures, Muller also worked on numerous arthouse and independent features. He shot Peter Bogdanovich’s Saint Jack (1979) and They All Laughed (1981) and William Friedkin’s To Live and Die in LA (1985).
For Alex Cox, Muller shot the cult science fiction satire Repo Man (1984), featuring Emilio Estevez as a repossession agent, extra-terrestrials, and a mysterious heat-generating device.
Play Repo Man (1984).
Muller also forged a professional association with American indie director Jim Jarmusch. They first worked together on Jarmusch’s celebrated third movie Down By Law (1986), centring on the escapades of three convicts. Muller also worked on Jarmusch’s Mystery Train (1989), Dead Man (1996), Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai (1989) and Coffee and Cigarettes (2003).
Play Coffee and Cigarettes (2003).
Alongside working with independent American directors, Muller continued to shooting for European arthouse filmmakers. Muller’s work on Lars von Trier’s groundbreaking tragedy Breaking the Waves (1996) is among his most celebrated.
“The superb cinematographer Robby Müller lit broad areas of space to facilitate freedom of movement on every location and set, and shot the action with handheld Super 35 mm cameras, lending rare visual dynamism to the CinemaScope screen,” David Sterrit noted in his essay for the Criterion Collection DVD.
Play Breaking the Waves (1996).
For Barbet Schroeder’s Barfly (1987), a loose portrait of the American writer and poet Charles Bukowski, Muller and his crew created the Kino Flo light, which created soft, fluorescent tones ones and could be used to make interior scenes look vivid and interesting.
Play Barfly (1987).
Muller’s final credit for a full-length feature was for Michael Winterbottom’s 24 Hour Party People in 2002. The movie traces Manchester’s music scene between 1976 and 1992 with a focus on Factory Records flamboyant co-founder Tony Wilson. Muller’s ability to create a very real sense of the creative chaos that marked the times is in full evidence.
Play 24 Hour Party People (2002).
In a lengthy interview conducted with Danish director Bart van Broekhoven in 2007, Muller discussed his approach to cinematography, his love for monochrome and his embrace of the digital medium. In response to the question of whether he considered himself a co-author of the films he had shot, Muller said. “Yes, in a way. I was always very loyal to the story. I did not go for my own victory…Genuine honesty, that makes a huge contribution to being able to make the right choices. If you honestly think about what a scene needs and you have the option to do it in other ways – with a big spotlight through the trees, for example – but that is crazy, then you leave it that way. You do not have to choose for your own glory, you also have to count with which set you stand.”",scroll.in,2018-07-04 22:57:04,32,309247
"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amesbury pair poisoned by Novichok
A man and woman found unconscious in Wiltshire were poisoned by Novichok - the same nerve agent that poisoned ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal, police say.
The couple, believed to be Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess, are in a critical condition having been found unconscious at a house on Saturday.
Police say no one else has presented with the same symptoms.
There was ""nothing in their background"" to suggest the pair were targeted, the Met Police said.
Image copyright Facebook Image caption The pair, believed to be Dawn Sturgess, 44 and Charlie Rowley, 45, were found unconscious on Saturday in Amesbury
Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said it could not be confirmed whether the nerve agent came from the same batch that Mr Skripal, and his daughter Yulia, were exposed to.
But he said the possibility was ""clearly a line of enquiry"".
Mr Basu said no contaminated items had yet been found, but officers were putting together a ""very detailed examination of [the couple's] movements"" in order to determine where they were poisoned.
He added that members of the public should not pick anything up if they don't know what it is.
""We have no idea what may have contained the nerve agent at this time,"" he said.
The Counter Terrorism Policing Network is now leading the investigation, working with Wiltshire Police.
Image copyright PA Image caption Police have cordoned off a number of areas including Muggleton Road in Amesbury
England's chief medical officer, Sally Davies, said: ""I want to reassure the public that the risk to the general public remains low.""
The Skripal episode meant officials had a ""well-established response"" in place, she said.
""As before, my advice is to wash your clothes and wipe down any personal items, shoes and bags, with cleansing or baby wipes before disposing of them in the usual way.
""You do not need to seek advice from a health professional unless you are experiencing symptoms, as any individual who had been significantly exposed at the same time would by now have symptoms.""
On Saturday, paramedics were called twice to the property in Amesbury - in the morning, after Ms Sturgess had collapsed, then later the same day, after Mr Rowley had also fallen unwell.
""It was initially believed that the two patients fell ill after using possibly heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs,"" Wiltshire Police said.
The news that Novichok was to blame was confirmed following analysis at the defence research facility at Porton Down, Wiltshire.
As a precautionary measure, sites in Amesbury and Salisbury, believed to have been visited by the couple before they fell ill, have been cordoned off.
There is no evidence to suggest either visited the sites that were decontaminated following the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal.
Local residents have been warned to expect to see an increased police presence - including officers wearing protective equipment.

Security correspondent Gordon Corera said the poisoning was ""hugely significant"" as the public ""will be worried about public health"".
He also added: ""The most likely hypothesis is that this is leftover Novichok from the attack on the Skripals back in March.
""Perhaps this is some of the Novichok prepared for the attack and discarded: maybe somewhere like a park, a house, and maybe these two came across it.""
He added it could give counter-terrorism investigators new leads on where the nerve agent was ""brought and put together"" before the attack on the Skripals.
Image caption The Amesbury branch of Boots was closed on Wednesday morning as a ""precautionary measure""
Home Secretary Sajid Javid said his thoughts were with the two individuals affected and thanked the emergency services and staff at Salisbury District Hospital.
He said the events follow ""the reckless and barbaric attack which took place in Salisbury in March"".
""The government's first priority is for the safety of the residents in the local area but as Public Health England has made clear, the risk to the general public is low,"" he said.

"The CBI will investigate the business of the Mongolian merchant ship, Motor Vessel Black Rose, nine years after it sank off the coast of Paradip.The Shipping Ministry has written to the bureau to investigate circumstances around the high profile accident in Septembre of 2009 at the peak of the mining boom. The case takes a political turn as opposition parties allege involvement of leaders in Naveen Patnaik’s Biju Janata Dal. PPT ) Chairman, Rinkesh Roy, however dismissed the idea that handing over the case to the CBI, almost a decade after the accident, was in any way political.""The port had spent Rs 17 crores in removing oil from the ship's double bottom tanks. That money has not come back to us. It is the exchequer's money. There clearly was some fraudulent practice, some of the ore loaded was from Jharkhand, the ship was from Mongolia, the shipping agent when penalised, went to court. This needed a broader and proper investigation,"" Roy told ET.The ship was to carry iron ore fines to China when it sank in 14 metres deep water within the port's limits. It's crew, excepting the Ukranian chief engineer had been rescued and fuel retrieved.""A clamour for a CBI inquiry had always been there, but the shipping agent had got a stay from a court in Kolkata, we moved the Supreme Court and now the matter is back in Cuttack High Court,"" said Roy.Speaking on condition of anonymity a shipping executive said it was the norm for agents and owners to disappear when such accidents occurred; it could easily cost Rs 100 crore to salvage wreckage like that of MV Rose .In a reply to an RTI querry, the PPT has said the 23,843 tonnes of iron ore on board belonged to AB Minerals and Resources and Rektor Mines.The 2009 incident had also been inquired into by PPT, state agencies and the Director General of Shipping. A year after the accident and that of another ship off the coast of Mangalore and other “near misses”, the ministry constituted a committee to look into existing practices of loading iron ore at Indian ports. The 2010 report blamed the accident on loading of wet iron ore fines during rains which caused the cargo to turn into slurry that moved to one side of the hold with the ship's initial list and caused its eventual sinking.Roy says certain systemic failures during those times had been plugged.Illegal exports of iron ore from Karnataka and Goa’s ports, and the CBI’s decision to close some of these cases, were raised during the Karnataka assembly polls earlier this year. The MB Shah Commission which investigated illegal mining of iron ore across the country, and had flagged those cases, had not covered exports from Odisha and Jharkhand “running out of time.” A member of the committee speaking on condition of anonymity said, ""It would be a more fruitful exercise to look at the other ships and cargo that could have under similar circumstances sailed off during that period.""While Odisha’s mine owners have been penalised for environment and forest violations, hundreds of traders and crushers that operated during the peak periods of the mining boom - around the time the MV Rose sank - have shut shop and moved on.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,2018-07-04 22:56:00,14,634336

"A bikie kingpin in custody on drug and gun charges has been slapped with new offences after a hidden lab was allegedly uncovered in regional NSW.
Senior Finks member Martin Francis Klein, 35, is already before the courts after being arrested while visiting a storage cage in Sydney's northwest in March.
A day earlier, police allegedly uncovered almost 90 kilograms of pills and powder, cocaine, two firearms, a silencer and ammunition in the cage in a residential car park at Kellyville Ridge.
Following his arrest, officers raided a property outside the small town of Tarago in the southern tablelands.
They allegedly found a drug lab used to make MDA, a drug similar to ecstasy.
Parts of the lab were seized for forensic examination and on Wednesday, almost four months after Klein's arrest, officers visited Goulburn Correctional Facility to lay fresh charges.
They include manufacturing a commercial quantity of drugs and directing a criminal group.
Klein remains in custody until his next scheduled court date in Goulburn on September 12.
The allegations come as police step up their attempts to crush a raging Hunter Valley turf war between Klein's club and rivals the Nomads.
The battle for drug territory in the region spilled over into a wave of drive-by shootings and public beatings which police feared were endangering the public.
In response, Strikeforce Raptor launched dozens of raids on bikie homes, clubhouses and a storage facility allegedly unearthing arsenals of shotguns, rifles, machine guns, explosives, cash and stashes of drugs.

"ZURICH: Switzerland, which permits low potency cannabis but bans most marijuana for recreational use, aims to allow pilot studies on ways to relax its laws, its government said on Wednesday.
It also proposed making it easier for people to access medical marijuana to treat conditions like multiple sclerosis or cancer.

Cannabis is now regularly used recreationally by about 200,000 people in Switzerland, the government said.
""Although current laws forbid its consumption and seek to punish it, this number is not declining,"" the government said. ""At the same time, the black market is flourishing, and the safety of consumers cannot be guaranteed due to a lack of quality control.""
Several cities and cantons in Switzerland are seeking to undertake studies to test different models for regulation, said the statement from the seven-member Federal Council, which serves as Switzerland's government. It recommended changes to laws to allow such pilot studies to proceed.
""The scientific pilot studies would be limited and restricted to specific areas,"" the government said. ""Participant numbers would also be limited, and minors would be excluded.""

A consultation on the pilot study proposal will run through Oct. 25 to take comment from interested parties.
Since 2011, Switzerland has allowed the sale of low potency cannabis, with minimal concentrations of the chemical that makes people high. Sales have taken off in recent years, bringing in tax revenue for the state. But some users say the ""marijuana-light"" simply isn't strong enough.
For medical marijuana use, Swiss law requires users to obtain an exemption from the federal health ministry. The government says this makes it difficult for the roughly 3,000 patients who now use the drug to get it.
It asked the Swiss Interior Ministry to come up with a proposal by next summer to streamline the process, and the Health Ministry to examine how to resolve insurance reimbursement issues for treatment with medical marijuana.

"Amethi (UP), July 4: RSS leaders talk about Mahatma Gandhi but follow Nathuram Godse, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday told party workers here as he accused the Hindutva organisation of trying to distort history.
""The RSS had no contribution in the freedom struggle but they distort history. On the other hand Congress leaders have contributed for the country in every way including in the freedom movement,"" a Congress leader quoted Rahul Gandhi as saying at a meeting here with the party's cyber workers.
The Congress president alleged that RSS leaders talk about Mahatma Gandhi but consider Godse as their idol.
Rahul Gandhi said the Congress' social media team would be expanded and party-men would be trained so as to give a befitting reply to RSS propaganda.
The Congress chief also hit out at the ""tall promises"" of Prime Minister Narendra Modi claiming the much talked about bullet train might not materialise at all.
""It should not be called a bullet train. It should be referred to as a magic train...It will never take shape...If at all it is ever made, it is going to be in Congress regime,"" Rahul Gandhi, who arrived on two day visit this morning, said.
Attacking the BJP government's foreign policy, Rahul Gandhi said despite the contentious and sensitive issue of Doklam on the border, Modi had preferred sitting on a swing with Chinese president, when he visited India.
The Congress chief, who launched a 'Shakti' portal for quick sharing of party activities among workers, alleged big businessmen were benefitting because of the ruling BJP's policies while the middle class and poorer sections were struggling.
""As much as Rs 2 lakh crores of 15 big businessmen was waived off..The first task that Narendra Modiji did was that he broke the backbone of the small and middle class businessmen,"" Rahul Gandhi alleged while interacting with party workers here.
He (Modi) snatched money from your pockets through GST and demonetisation and gave it away to Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi, the Congress president said continuing his tirade. Employment generation had also been hit adversely, he added.
Stressing on the need to strengthen the party organisation upto the village level, he said a lot of work was being done in this regard.
There is a need to get connected with people and strongly put party policies before them, he said speaking to party activists from all assembly segments at Fursatganj.
Later Rahul Gandhi visited Pure Dhingai village to condole the death of a farmer who reportedly died recently while waiting for the sale of his crop at a government centre.
During the visit, Rahul Gandhi will make a night halt at the party office in Gauriganj.
Last time he stayed in the dak bungalow of Tatarpur in Jagdishpur area unlike his previous visits when he used to stay at the guest house of Sanjay Gandhi hospital.
Although the district unit president of the BJP Umashankar Pandey said that Rahul Gandhi was staying away from the hospital guest house after BJP objected to it, district unit spokesman of Congress Anil Singh said it was done for the benefit of party workers and for saving time in visiting all parts of the constituency.
Earlier this morning, Rahul Gandhi was accorded a warm welcome at the Lucknow airport by party workers including UPCC president Raj Babbar.
Tomorrow, the Congress chief is scheduled to hold chaupal with farmers and visit villages before leaving for New Delhi in the afternoon.

Scuffles broke out on Wednesday between Israeli authorities and protesters who feared preparations were underway to raze a Bedouin village in a strategic part of the occupied West Bank, despite international calls for a reprieve.
Protesters, including some waving Palestinian flags, tried to block a bulldozer and scuffled with police at Khan al-Ahmar, east of Jerusalem. Some climbed onto the bulldozer in protest.
Israeli police said 11 people were arrested. Israeli rights group B'Tselem said they included the organisation's own head of field research.
The Palestinian Red Crescent reported 35 people injured, with four taken to hospital. Police said the wounded included three officers, including one taken to hospital.
Police said stones were thrown at officers.
The incident came after activists said the Israeli military had issued a warrant to the 173 residents of Khan al-Ahmar on Tuesday, authorising soldiers to seize access roads to the village.
Heavy equipment was seen around the village on Wednesday, prompting speculation a road was being prepared to facilitate its evacuation and demolition.
""Today they are proceeding with infrastructure work to facilitate the demolition and forcible transfer of residents,"" Amit Gilutz, spokesman for B'Tselem, told AFP.
Israeli authorities say the village and its school were built illegally, and in May the supreme court rejected a final appeal against its demolition.
But activists say the villagers had little alternative but to build without Israeli construction permits, as the documents are almost never issued to Palestinians for building in parts of the West Bank where Israel has full control over civilian affairs.
Israel authorities say they have offered villagers an alternative site.
The village is made up mainly of makeshift structures of tin and wood, as is traditionally the case with Bedouin villages.
It is unclear when the demolition will take place.
'Deeper hole'
Senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat condemned the demolition plans and appealed to the international community.
""Are we coming to see one day that Israel can be held accountable?"" he asked journalists in Ramallah.
""If not, it means you're pushing this region towards a deeper hole of violence and counter-violence and extremes.""
Britain's minister of state for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, visited the village in May and called on the Israeli government to show restraint.
He warned that any forced relocation ""could constitute forcible transfer of people as far as the United Nations is concerned.""
Forcible transfer is considered a violation of the Geneva Conventions.
Khan al-Ahmar is located east of Jerusalem near several major Israeli settlement blocs and close to a highway leading to the Dead Sea.
Activists are concerned continued Israeli settlement construction in the area could effectively divide the West Bank in two.
In another Bedouin village in the same region, Abu Nuwar, Israel carried out a series of demolitions Wednesday on what it described as illegally built structures.
B'Tselem said nine residential structures and three agricultural ones were demolished, leaving 62 people homeless.
The Israeli defence ministry's COGAT unit for civilian affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories said the demolitions had taken place after the ""owners of the buildings failed to utilise the planning procedures to their fullest extent"".
""This despite the fact that they were given the opportunity to enquire in the matter and were told that if they did not, the illegal construction would be demolished,"" it said in a statement.",www.pulse.ng,2018-07-04 22:55:00,29,239792

"The PKK-affiliated Democratic Union Party (PYD), which is currently conducting an open war against Turkey, plays a key role in the fight against Daesh according to its main backers, namely the U.S. and Europe. The PYD and its international backers have admitted that Daesh still exists despite its retreat into the desert between the Iraq-Syria border and claim the PYD's existence is crucial for preventing the re-expansion of the terrorist group. However, recent developments have indicated that the forces confronting Daesh are actually loyal to the Syrian regime.
Yesterday, Daesh-affiliated media said the son of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed during a fight with Syrian and Russian troops in Homs. Identifying a young man as Huthaifa al-Badri in a picture, Daesh said he was Baghdadi's young son. Though details on exactly when he was killed are unknown, a statement said the young man was killed during a fight with Syrian and Russian troops when the latter raided a power station. Homs is in the western region of the country between Idlib and Damascus. It is believed that Daesh still has a small presence in the area, including in the Yarmouk refugee camp. Yet, it is not clear whether the group is as organized as before. During Turkey's military incursions in al-Bab and Jarablus, the group was erased from the north, retreating to the south.
In the country's east, mainly in Raqqa, regime forces and Russian troops targeted Daesh militants. Recapturing several towns and villages around Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, forces loyal to the regime are fighting the militants locally. Fars News Agency on Wednesday reported that certain tribes loyal to the regime have marched to Raqqa, chanting slogans against Daesh.
Meanwhile, the PYD claims that its existence is crucial for the fight against Daesh. The U.S.-led anti-Daesh coalition has been carrying out aerial attacks on Daesh positions; although recently the U.S., under the pretext of fighting Daesh, claimed to have attacked some other forces on the ground, including those loyal to Iran. Besides, the PYD's fight has focused on Turkey with the group frequently targeting Turkish security forces near the border. By providing training areas for PKK militants, the PYD has helped the separatist terror organization carry out attacks in Turkey.
The PYD has expressed its plans to seek autonomy despite the expressed concerns of Turkey, Russia and the regime. According to recent reports in Lebanese media, the PYD and the Syrian regime signed a preliminary agreement on Monday in al-Hasakah, a city in the country's north where both PYD and the regime forces exist. Al-Masdar newspaper claimed that the agreement foresees that PYD militants will join regime forces and handover some villages near the Turkish and Iraqi borders. In return, the Kurdish language will be part of Syria's educational system, fighting for the PYD will be counted as a service in the regime's army and a Kurdish official will have a permanent seat in the Oil Ministry.
Regardless of whether the agreement will be implemented or not, it is certain that the PYD's agenda extends beyond U.S. claims that its sole purpose is to aid in the fight against Daesh.",www.dailysabah.com,2018-07-04 22:53:04,22,198043
"MADRID (AP) — Six of nine prominent Catalan separatist politicians jailed for promoting the region's drive to secede from Spain have been moved to prisons closer to their homes.
Some observers see the prison transfer as a goodwill gesture by the central Spanish authorities ahead of a key meeting next week between Spain's new prime minister and Catalonia's new regional president, amid hopes for a thaw in relations between Madrid and the Catalan capital Barcelona.
But Catalan President Quim Torra rejected that interpretation Wednesday and stuck to his hard line on Catalan independence.
Torra said in a statement outside the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona that the transfer is stipulated by law and ""is not part of any negotiation.""
He says the Catalan conflict with Madrid is political, not legal.",www.taiwannews.com.tw,2018-07-04 22:53:00,5,2738
"NEW YORK (AP) - Yankees second baseman Gleyber Torres was placed on the 10-day disabled list on Wednesday because of a strained right hip.
Torres was removed after striking out in his second at-bat in the fourth inning before the Yankees went on to beat the Atlanta Braves 6-2.
Before the series finale against the National League East leaders, Yankees manager Aaron Boone was upbeat about the status of his prized rookie.

Torres did not start in Tuesday night's win, but entered the game late as a defensive replacement.
""We're hoping it's a short stint. But we think we've got to deal with it this time because there is a small strain there,"" Boone said outside the home clubhouse after the game.
""Hopefully it won't be something that it's too long. Probably take us up to the All-Star break.""
Boone said the club would assess the situation with a day off Thursday before heading to Toronto for the start of an 11-game, three-city road trip leading into the All-Star Game in Washington.
Torres is hitting .294 with 15 home runs and 42 RBIs in his first 63 major league games.
He had an MRI and was not available to talk to reporters after the game.
Neil Walker, who went over from third base to second at the start of the fifth inning, could get most of the work in Torres' absence.
Another option could be Ronald Torreyes, but he's been on the temporary inactive list at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre for more than a week to deal with a personal issue. Brandon Drury, who started 114 games at second for Arizona last season, could also figure into the mix.
Boone wasn't sure how the injury initially occurred, pointing out that Torres had made some ""good base running plays a couple of nights ago when he moved up on some wild pitches.""
The Yankees manager also added that if the injury had occurred late in the season, it would've been ""possible"" for the phenom to be back on the field shortly.
But the team with the second-best record in baseball took the safe route.
""Anytime you're talking about groin, hamstring, quads, once you have a strain in there, you push through it you can make it a worse strain,"" Boone said.
""And now you're talking weeks and months. Stuff like that. So I think the wise thing is to do this now. Gleyber wants to take a couple of days, work through it. But I think he also understands this is the best thing for him and for us.""

"She's spoken openly about her struggles with menopause after undergoing a double mastectomy and hysterectomy.
And Michelle Heaton broke down in tears on Wednesday as she admitted her daughter Faith, 6, may need to have her womb and breasts removed should she inherit the faulty BRCA2 gene, which can lead to breast and ovarian cancer.
Speaking to The Sun, Michelle struggled to hold back her tears as she spoke about the fear she has every time she thinks about her daughter possibly having the gene, adding that she will take the test to find out when she turns 18.
Heartbreaking: Michelle Heaton broke down in tears on Wednesday after admitting her daughter Faith may need to have her breasts and womb removed
In the candid chat Michelle struggled to hold back her tears as she spoke about her daughter, admitting sometimes she struggles to even look at her given what could happen in her future.
She said: 'I actually get a lump in my throat . . . I mean it's horrible to look at her... in my head, the best way to look at it is when she is 18, and she gets offered the test, I hope that science evolves, and there is another option, than what I've had to choose.'
The Liberty X singer also confessed that suffering her menopause so young wasn't easy, and was convinced at one point her husband Hugh Hanley would leave her.
Emotional: In an interview with The Sun, the 38-year-old revealed her daughter will need to have a test when she's 18 to see if she's inherited the faulty BRAC2 gene
Michelle - who is also mum to four-year-old Aaron with husband Hugh - added that her daughter was the primary reason behind her decision to write a book about her battles with the menopause, which was brought on early following her hysterectomy and double mastectomy.
On the book - titled Hot Flush: Motherhood, the Menopause and Me - she added: 'So when she is of an age where she can understand I will just give her the book, and wait and see if she has any questions.
'As nothing has been forgotten, and it has all been explained. Maybe then she will realise why mummy has been a bit upset.'
Tough time: Michelle also said she decided to write a book about her struggles with the early menopause, so her daughter will understand when she's older
Michelle has spoken openly about her struggles after making the brave decision to undergo the procedures in 2015, to severely reduce the risk of cancer which had been heightened by the mutated BRCA2 gene.
And despite battling with self confidence, the star recently said she's now learning to embrace her body hang-ups, in an interview with Fit & Well magazine.
‘I just remember that everybody is different,' she said. 'We all have different bodies, different situations and even different experiences of the menopause. You have to find your positives and make them the best they can be.'
She added: 'I want to educate my daughter Faith to focus on what she loves about herself rather than dwelling on other things – we’ve all got our hang-ups.'",www.dailymail.co.uk,2018-07-04 22:52:47,18,263508

"Egypt's highest appellate court yesterday annulled a decision to place more than 1,500 people on the country's official terrorist list, including former president Mohammed Morsi. The Court of Cassation accepted appeals by Morsi and 1,537 other defendants against putting their names on the terrorist list, a judicial source said on condition of anonymity due to restrictions on speaking to media.
Prominent Egyptian football player Mohammed Abu Treika was among those placed on the list. Egyptian authorities accuse the defendants of having links with the Muslim Brotherhood group, which the military-backed authorities declared a terrorist organization in 2013.

Global ultrapure water market for the semiconductor industry: Increase in the size of semiconductor wafers
Prevention of contamination is crucial to the semiconductor production process. Contaminant-free semiconductor wafers are used in the semiconductor production process. Cleaning of semiconductor wafers is critical, and this process requires ultrapure water. Technavio estimates that for the existing 300mm fabs, 1.5-4.5 million gallons of ultrapure water is required per day.
Over the last four decades, the size of silicon wafers used in the semiconductor industry has increased to 300mm, which has reduced the manufacturing costs of semiconductor wafers. Semiconductor manufacturers are thus investing heavily in upgrading and developing new fabs for the new wafer size.
According to a senior analyst at Technavio, “The industry plans to develop the 450-mm wafer technology, with the pilot production expected to commence by the end of 2018. Intel has invested in the R&D of the 450mm technology and is building a production facility for the same. The shift toward the use of large sizes and development of new manufacturing units to cater to this demand are factors that will drive the market during the forecast period.”

"Iran will uphold the nuclear deal if it can continue to reap its economic benefits despite revived U.S. sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said yesterday during a visit to Vienna. The foreign ministers of Iran and five major powers will meet in the Austrian capital on Friday in an effort to save the agreement that is meant to prevent Iranian nuclear armament, the European Union confirmed.
The United States pulled out of the deal and took steps to reimpose economic sanctions in May, leaving Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China to salvage the 2015 agreement that is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
""We will stick to it as far as possible, on the condition that we can profit from the JCPOA,"" Rouhani told reporters after meeting Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen.
""If the other signatory states can guarantee Iran's interests, we will continue with the JCPOA without the U.S.,"" he added.
The nuclear pact that was agreed in Vienna in 2015 obliged Iran to curb its nuclear program and accept intrusive nuclear inspections to make sure that the Islamic Republic cannot develop nuclear weapons.
Western sanctions including an embargo on Iranian oil exports were lifted in return.
On Friday, the five powers are expected to present a plan to prevent renewed economic isolation of Iran in spite of the looming U.S. sanctions. Friday's meeting of the foreign ministers from Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China is due to be chaired by EU chief diplomat Federica Mogherini.",www.dailysabah.com,2018-07-04 22:51:50,9,198071

"Employees of U.N. refugee agency UNRWA staged a rally in the blockaded Gaza Strip yesterday to protest the recent termination of their permanent employment contracts. Protesters decried the agency's decision on Monday to terminate the permanent contracts of hundreds of UNRWA employees and replace them with temporary contracts.
""This move will adversely affect the services provided by the UNRWA in the Gaza Strip and those provided to more than 1.3 million Palestinian refugees [across the region],"" Amir al-Meshal, head of the UNRWA employees' union, said at the protest. ""These reductions are the beginning of the agency's slow demise,"" he lamented. He went on to urge the international community to financially support UNRWA, warning that recent reductions in the agency's budget would have a negative impact on Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip and throughout the region.
Last month, UNRWA was forced to end its emergency food program, a move that will likely have an adverse impact on food assistance provided to 1.3 million Palestinian refugees in the blockaded Gaza.

"A manual count of contested votes in northern Iraq's Kirkuk region in the federal elections started yesterday with monitoring by judges.
Following the May 12 elections, the electronic vote counting was controversial, leading many to object to the results and demand the re-count. Due to these demands, approximately 160,000 votes are expected to be recounted in six additional more regions.
The Iraqi parliament earlier in June voted in favor of amending Iraq's election law, allowing votes to be recounted manually, a decision that was upheld by the Supreme Federal Court.
After the elections, Iraqi Turkmens and several Arab and Kurd groups in Kirkuk protested alleged fraud in the country's first parliamentary elections since the defeat of Daesh. Confusion has gripped Iraq since the win by Shiite cleric Moqtada Sadr's electoral alliance with communists, even as negotiations to form a new government are underway. Protesters claimed their votes were illegally changed in favor of Kurdish parties by local officials at polling stations.
Prime Minister Haydar al-Abadi, who was defeated as his alliance came third, said the government's investigations of the elections stemmed from serious violations made by the independent election commission. Thus, the nine-member independent commission was dismissed and will be replaced by judges.
According to intelligence services, tests of electronic voting machines, used for the first time in Iraqi elections, produced varied results, appearing to give credence to the fraud claims.

"Alchemist ARC president Srishti Dhir.
Mumbai: Alchemist Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd is planning to focus on acquiring control of and restructuring stressed companies that have been admitted in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) through the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC), said a senior executive of the firm.
Delhi-based Alchemist ARC is sponsored by Alok Dhir, managing partner of Dhir and Dhir Associates and Delhi-based NBFC DMI Finance. The ARC has former State Bank of India chairman Pratip Chaudhuri as its chairman.
“Our business strategy going ahead is to use our platform to combine financial strength with operational capabilities to acquire and restructure companies referred to NCLT under the IBC. It (IBC) has increased the business opportunities for ARCs as the decision making on stressed financial assets has been expedited and, fortunately, an exception has been carved out for ARCs from being treated as ineligible to submit a resolution plan where a connected party may be disqualified under section 29A,” said Srishti Dhir, president at Alchemist ARC.
Alchemist will tie up with strategic players with relevant industry and operational experience for acquiring companies through the IBC process.
“We are now looking to tie up with strategic partners who are having the operational capabilities to run businesses or identify independent professional management to enable us to acquire and operate the stresses companies. There is a big opportunity for specialized players such as ARCs to participate in the process, because of the sheer number and scale of stressed companies going through the process,” said Dhir.
Dhir added that Alchemist has already made a couple of such bids, along with strategic tie-ups. She added that ARCs can be a strong partner for strategic investors given their understanding of the IBC process and the related risks.
“Industry players may find it challenging to bid for distressed companies due to the risks and hurdles involved in insolvency and bankruptcy. But with the support of ARCs, there can be a huge scope for mergers and acquisitions and consolidation for specific industry players,” she said.
Dhir added that Alchemist is in the process of strategizing and shortlisting 4 or 5 sectors where it will focus our energies.
“Our current bad loans portfolio is spread across hospitality, real estate and all kinds of manufacturing,” she said.
The ARC is also planning to raise fresh equity capital this year to fund its growth plans.
“This year we are planning to privately place NCDs. We are also raising funds from banks. In the second half of the financial year, we will have a fresh round of equity fundraising. We have already had three rounds of equity fundraising since 2012. We are looking to raise at least Rs150 crore across debt and equity this year,” said Dhir.
Apart from looking at acquiring direct control of businesses through the IBC process, the ARC is also looking at growing its bad loan portfolio significantly this year.
“We are planning to increase our book quite substantially. Our gross NPA portfolio is around Rs5,000 crore and we are targeting to double that in this financial year. Our AUM has increased by five times since 2014-15. Last financial year it grew by 50%,” Dhir added.",www.livemint.com,2018-07-04 22:50:02,26,159359
"BRITAIN’S town centres are ""in big danger of becoming ghost towns” and must “forget retail” to survive.
A bombshell report by retail expert Bill Grimsey has set out a blueprint on how to save the High Street from collapse. Bill Grimsey, former head of Wickes, Iceland and Focus DIY, has listed 25 recommendations that could do the job. One of them state: “Accept that there is already too much retail space in the UK… “…and that bricks and mortar retailing can no longer be the anchor for thriving high streets and town centres. Instead of shops, the report states: “They need to be repopulated and re-fashioned as community hubs, including housing, health and leisure, entertainment, education, arts, business/office space and some shops.”

Grimsey warned in the report how online shopping and out-of-town shopping centres with free parking are killing the High Street. But not even the introduction of free parking to town centres are enough to save them now, he said. ""If it was that simple then people would have done it already,"" he told the BBC. ""The point is that the retail proposition in town centres has been overtaken by the more convenient out-of-town parks. The town centres should say 'let them have it'.

This could then be implanted into a surrogate to gestate.""Within three years we hope to have the first (northern white) rhino calf born,"" said Thomas Hildebrandt of Germany's Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, who co-led the work. The findings were published in the journal Nature Communications on Wednesday.The low-grade sperm have to be activated with a lab culture so that they can be used in an IVF technique known as intracytoplasmic injection.The hybrid embryos have developed enough for implantation, and have now been frozen while scientists seek potential surrogate southern white rhino females to carry them to term.Cesare Galli of the Italian animal assisted reproduction firm Avantea, who worked with Hildebrandt, said there had originally been strong opposition from some conservationists to ""interfering in nature"" by using IVF or other lab techniques to save the northern white rhino.""Many people working in the conservation area are very against using biotechnology,"" he said.Hildebrandt argued that using biotechnology was not unnatural, and would simply correct a change in the ecosystem created by the human hunting of rhinos.""The northern white rhino did not fail evolution, it failed because it was not bullet-proof. It was slaughtered,"" he said.""It caused a disbalance in the ecosystem ... and we have the tools in our hands to correct that.""",economictimes.indiatimes.com,2018-07-04 22:50:00,8,634355

The envoy asked more Kenyans to take advantage of the enabling environment that includes an all-inclusive business permit acquired within six hours of application.
“In the area of trade, we are witnessing a steady increase of the overall trade volume between our two countries,” he said.
The envoy noted that Rwanda’s exports to Kenya have included coffee, tea, hides and skins and cereals at Sh11.3 billion last year and Kenya’s exports to Rwanda have accounted for Sh11.5 billion.
He said to date; Kenyan investment in Rwanda is worth Sh 41.8 billion which makes Kenya the leading contributors to Foreign Direct Investment in Rwanda.
“We deeply appreciate the role of Kenya’s private sector for its huge contribution to Rwanda’s economic transformation,” he said.
Mr. Kimonyo announced that country has dedicated this year’s anniversary to highlighting investment and business opportunities in Rwanda.
“The ‘Visit Rwanda’ movement has attracted a lot of attention globally. After Rwanda signed a deal with Arsenal Football Club in May this year, the number of people searching Rwanda on line has increased by almost 6,000 per cent,” noting that they are confident that this marketing strategy will bring a lot of tourists in Rwanda and our sub-region.

He said, through the Northern Corridor Integration Projects framework relating to Single tourist visa, one can visit Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda using the same visa
Speaking at the same event, Kenya’s Permanent Secretary in the Foreign Ministry Ambassador Macharia Kamau who was chief guest lauded the Rwandan people for their resilience.
“The transformation you have seen in Rwanda is monumental and was unimaginable 24 years ago,” said Mr. Macharia who was a UNDP official coordinating humanitarian and reconstruction effort after the 1994 Rwanda genocide against the Tutsi.
Mr Macharia said Kenya will continue with the good bilateral relations and thanked Rwanda for choosing Kenya as the preferred source of FDI.
Both Kenya and Rwanda enjoy warm relations that are marked with close collaboration and strategic partnerships on issues of sub-regional, regional and international scope. Since 1994, Rwanda has made tremendous strides that have elevated the country to a nation of reference in regard to various aspects of state recovery and national development.
“Rwanda’s transformational leadership and resolute political will has been at the center of the transformed governance and socio-economic fabric of the Rwandan economy. This has been made possible through strengthening of national institutions, consolidating peace and security, cultivating national unity, spearheading women empowerment and gender equality. In this regard, Kenya takes great pride in the economic milestones achieved by Rwanda.” Macharia noted

Ambassador James Kimonyo recalled how on the day of 4th of July 1994, His Excellency President Paul Kagame, commanding the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA) single handedly stopped the genocide when the entire world stood by and watched.
“As we celebrate this important day, we want to honor his heroism, bravely and extraordinary courage in stopping the genocide and liberating our country,” he said.
He saluted some of the Senior Officers, present at the celebrations, who participated in the country’s liberation struggle which saved it from total destruction.
In the past 24 years the country has forged strong bonds among our citizens through Unity and reconciliation, maintained a stable and secure state, built strong and sound justice system to foster rule of Law, established strong governance and democratic dispensation, grew our economy at an average rate of 8 per cent at least in the last 10 years or so and provided effective social services to our citizens in terms of healthcare and education.

"NEW YORK (AP) - With backyard barbecues and fireworks thundering across night skies, Americans are celebrating Independence Day by participating in time-honored traditions that express pride in their country's 242nd birthday.
But this quintessential American holiday will also be marked with a sense of a United States divided for some - evidenced by competing televised events in the nation's capital.
From New York to California, July Fourth festivities will be at times lively and lighthearted, with Macy's July Fourth fireworks and Nathan's Famous hot dog eating contest.

The day's events will also be stately and traditional, with parades lining streets across the country and the world's oldest commissioned warship firing a 21-gun salute to mark the 242 years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
For some Western states, however, the holiday will be a bit more muted as high wildfire danger forces communities to cancel fireworks displays.
Here are highlights of Wednesday's festivities so far:
OLDEST WARSHIP
The USS Constitution has sailed in Boston Harbor and fired her guns again to mark Independence Day.
The world's oldest commissioned warship still afloat left its berth at the Charlestown Navy Yard Wednesday morning. It glided through the harbor to mark 242 years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
The ship nicknamed ""Old Ironsides"" traveled to Fort Independence on Castle Island to fire a 21-gun salute. The ship's commander saluted the crowds gathered there.
A Navy sailor on board recited the Declaration of Independence during the cruise.
An additional 17-gun salute was fired as the ship passed the U.S. Coast Guard Station on its way back to the Charlestown Navy Yard. The station is the former site of the shipyard where the vessel was built in 1797.
A HISTORIC PARADE
Crowds are lining the streets in a Rhode Island town to see what's billed as the nation's oldest continuous Fourth of July celebration. Begun in 1785, the Bristol parade typically attracts about 100,000 people to the seaside town.
This year's was a scorcher: Temperatures hovered near 90 degrees when the parade began late Wednesday morning, and some marchers were treated for heat exhaustion and taken off the route.
Many officials marched in the parade, including Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo and the members of the state's congressional delegation.
DUELING CELEBRATIONS
The country's longest-running live national July Fourth television tradition is PBS' broadcast of music and fireworks from the U.S. Capitol's West Lawn. But it's facing new counterprogramming this year from the White House, which is hosting its own concert and view of the National Park Service's fireworks show.
PBS' ""A Capitol Fourth"" has the bigger stars, including The Beach Boys, Jimmy Buffett, Pentatonix, Chita Rivera, Luke Combs and The Temptations. It will be hosted by John Stamos.
The entertainers on the 90-minute White House event airing on the Hallmark Channel include singer-songwriter Sara Evans, pianist Lola Astanova and two former ""American Idol"" finalists. Both shows will include the fireworks display from the National Park Service.
First lady Melania Trump said in a statement that the White House show would allow Americans to ""tune in from their homes and be part of the festivities."" PBS declined to comment.
LIGHTING UP THE NIGHT SKIES
In New York, the Macy's fireworks show over the East River promises 25 minutes of sparkle and ""ahhhh,"" plus the West Point Band and entertainers including Kelly Clarkson, Ricky Martin and Keith Urban on NBC's broadcast.
But some places in the American West have canceled their planned July Fourth fireworks because of high wildfire danger and others are doing drone light displays instead of pyrotechnics.
In Colorado, the wildfire danger forced some communities to cancel their July 4th fireworks. However, other shows will still go as planned in Denver, Colorado Springs and Fort Collins.
The small mountain town of Silverton in southwestern Colorado called off the fireworks part of its annual Independence Day party, but the rest of Wednesday's celebration is still on, including live music a water fight with firefighters. Aspen will have a fire-proof drone light display above town.
NEW AMERICANS, DIVIDED AMERICA
This was the first Fourth of July that many people were able to call themselves U.S. citizens after participating in naturalization ceremonies across the country.
In New Hampshire, more than 100 people from 48 countries became U.S. citizens during a ceremony at the Strawbery Banke museum in Portsmouth as part of the museum's annual ""American Celebration."" A ceremony was also held aboard the USS New Jersey, where dozens of people from countries including Vietnam and Bangladesh were sworn in.
The new citizens pledged allegiance to a country where some people lament that the ability to debate respectfully the toughest issues of the day seems hopelessly lost. Several people were arrested Wednesday after hanging a banner from the Statue of Liberty's pedestal that called for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
For Brad Messier, a chef in Portland, Maine, the holiday ""seems to illustrate the glaring divides that we have."" He asked: ""How much does going and seeing fireworks really bring people together?""
But in rural Shelby County, Alabama, retired truck driver Floyd Champion said he views these as the best of times in America, adding: ""I love the holiday because it's our independence.""
HOT DOG EATING HISTORY
Defending champions Joey ""Jaws"" Chestnut and Miki Sudo held onto their titles at the Nathan's Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest. They each downed dozens of wieners and buns in front of thousands of spectators at the annual seaside affair at New York City's Coney Island.
The 34-year-old Chestnut surpassed his previous record by 2 hot dogs, gobbling down 74 franks and buns in 10 minutes. He won the Mustard Belt and his 11th title.
Sudo held onto her title as the top woman's competitor, chomping 37 franks and buns to take home the top prize for an unprecedented fifth consecutive year.
FIREWORKS ACCIDENTS
Two men died and five other people were injured after a large tree branch fell on spectators during a fireworks display in western Illinois late Tuesday. Rock Island County sheriff's officials say dozens of people were sitting near the tree at the time.
In Maryland, a 21-year-old man was hospitalized with ""catastrophic injuries"" to both hands after setting off fireworks at a large outdoor party where several attendees brought illegal fireworks, according to investigators. They say the man's injuries weren't life-threatening.

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday said EU member states should assume more responsibility in creating a European solution for the refugee crisis as she praised Turkey for hosting more than 3 million Syrian refugees in its borders.
""This challenge is not something one or several member states can address alone; rather, this is a task for all of us,"" Merkel stressed during her address at the German Parliament, the Bundestag, and said the leaders reached a common understanding on the need for closer cooperation.
She also underlined the importance of an EU decision last week to allocate an additional 3 billion euros in assistance for Syrian refugees in Turkey.
""We can criticize Turkey on many other issues, but what Turkey has done by providing shelter to refugees that have fled civil war in Syria is a big contribution. And that deserves the appreciation,"" she stressed.
Amid criticism from opposition politicians, Merkel underlined that the EU's financial aid was not transferred to Turkey's state budget but specifically used for projects to improve the conditions of Syrian refugees.
She praised the success of EU-Turkey cooperation and vowed to clinch agreements with African countries to control irregular migrant flows through the Mediterranean.
In 2016, Merkel championed the EU-Turkey refugee agreement with the hope of stopping the refugee influx after nearly a million refugees arrived in Germany.
The EU had pledged 6 billion euros in funding for the refugees and promised to mobilize the second 3-billion-euro tranche by the end of 2018.The agreement has been successful in significantly reducing the number of crossings in the Aegean Sea and preventing the loss of many lives.Turkey hosts some 3.5 million Syrians, more than any other country in the world. Ankara says it has spent around $25 billion helping and sheltering refugees since the beginning of the Syrian civil war

"China's Finance Ministry has stated it will not fire the first shot on the implementation of tariffs in a trade dispute with the United States.
The ministry, in a statement, said it would not implement its tariffs on U.S. goods, which are set to take effect on July 6 before the United States imposes its tariffs on Chinese goods. This statement follows reports from the European Officials who reported that China is allegedly putting pressure on the European Union to issue a strong joint statement against President Donald Trump’s trade policies.
Sputnik spoke to Dr Louis Brennan, Professor in Business Studies at Trinity College Dublin, on what this means for international trade.
CC0 ‘EU, China Have Common Interests to Cope With US Protectionism’ - Analyst
Dr Louis Brennan: It’s undoubtedly significant, it’s perhaps not surprising because it’s certainly consistent with what would have been China’s ambition for some time to develop a closer relationship with Europe, and in that way offset the influence of longstanding European American relationships.
So in that respect, it’s as I say, significant but not surprising. Its significance is also related to the fact that in the past, China would be more seeking to neutralize the impact and influence of the European relationship.
The latest announcements are looking to drive a wedge between the US and Europe, which is quite significant as well.
Sputnik: What effect will this have on Philip Hammond's/Britain’s recent renewed commitment on improving economic and political relationships with China?
© AP Photo / Evan Vucci Trump Slams EU as 'Possibly as Bad as China' on Trade Amid Tariffs Row Dr Louis Brennan: I think from Britain’s point of view and in light of Philip Hammond’s recent statement, [Britain] are looking to oppose Brexit context. Its highly desirable and very important from a British point of view, that relationships with China are as close as a possible and in that respect, China and the UK, in the context of China’s relationship with other European countries, has been quite close.
The UK has been a firm advocate of Chinese relations in terms of trade and investment. Outside of the EU (if that is where Britain is to end up after the ongoing Brexit negotiations), China is probably likely according less importance to the relationship with Britain, in the sense that Europe is a much greater and important entity in the terms of trade for China than the UK is.
Nonetheless it does offer some prospect of maintaining the relationship with China and perhaps a more open-door on the part of China for a closer relationship with the UK as well.
Sputnik: What effect will China's actions have on international trade between the East, USA and the EU?
Dr Louis Brennan: What we know is the existing trading relationship between China and the EU is a very important relationship. China and the EU are very large trading partners, and hence the nature of that relationship, is very important in terms of both parties economies.
So, there is an imperative on part of the EU and China, that trading relationships continue and continue in a non-confrontational fashion. Of course, the EU does have some issues with China in terms of trade and investment; notably the absence of reciprocity on the part of China in terms of access to its markets for EU companies. With that said, its very unlikely that into the future the EU/China trade relationship will be anything other than reasonably smooth.
On the other hand, given the developments from what we’ve seen from Washington, the US and the Trump administration, the trading relations between China and the US has become quite fraught and even more fraught into the future.
It’s [trade relations] very much poised on a knife edge at the moment, there is the risk of ongoing tit-for-tat between the US and China and that could lead to a very difficult situation in terms of the trading relations between the US and China.

"Cameroon has transferred six schools affiliated with the Gülenist Terror Group (FETÖ), the terrorist organization behind the 2016 defeated coup in Turkey, to a special Turkish foundation.""Cameroon authorities told us that those who dared to commit such a betrayal are a threat to Cameroon too,"" Hüsnü Murat Ülkü, Turkey's ambassador to Cameroon, told Anadolu Agency (AA) yesterday, referring to the defeated July 15 coup attempt, which took 251 lives and injured 2,200.
Cameroon showed great solidarity with Turkey by transferring the FETÖ schools to the Turkish Maarif Foundation, he added.
Turkey established the Maarif Foundation in 2016 to take over the administration of overseas schools linked to FETÖ. It also establishes schools and education centers abroad. Dozens of African countries have handed over FETÖ schools to Maarif or closed them down at Ankara's request.
Ülkü explained that Cameroonian authorities waited until the end of the school year so as to minimize the disruption for students.
Relations between Turkey and Cameroon are excellent, he said.
""The transfer of the schools is a development which confirms strong bonds and solid friendship,"" Ülkü added.
Birol Akgün, Maarif's head, thanked the Cameroonian government and stressed Maarif will do a better job educating its young students.
""We will continue to take over FETÖ-affiliated schools in Africa and in various parts of the world,"" he explained.
Turkey has asked several countries to shut down dozens of schools, colleges and businesses linked to the FETÖ network in the wake of the July 15 coup attempt.Ankara says FETÖ is behind a long-running campaign to overthrow the Turkish state by infiltrating Turkish institutions, particularly the military, police and judiciary.
The terrorist group is also known to operate hundreds of schools under the auspices of its network around the world. For decades, it disguised itself as a charity movement with religious undertones, opening schools, charities and companies in numerous countries where the children of the elite are enrolled, thus extending its international clout, said prosecutors investigating the international network.
FETÖ members enjoyed safe haven in most countries they operated in before the 2016 coup attempt, but Turkey's diplomatic efforts after the putsch bid have paid off with most countries agreeing to cooperate with Ankara in the crackdown on the terrorists.",www.dailysabah.com,2018-07-04 22:47:53,15,197966

"This week Helen McGinn (pictured) tries Les Etoiles Rosé paired with grilled salmon
BARGAIN OF THE WEEK
Tesco Finest Picpoul de Pinet 2016, £6.50 (normally £7)
I Love this perfect summer white from vineyards near the coast in the Languedoc, with its fresh, crisp green apple fruit. Made from the Picpoul grape, it’s happy on its own — and even happier with a plate of seafood. If you could bottle sea breeze, this comes pretty close.
ROSE
Les Etoiles Rosé, £11.99, Co-op
This wine is a star. Well, three stars, according to the label. It’s made from the Grenache grape by the Perrin family in Provence, the same lot behind the wine from Bran- gelina’s Chateau Miraval — which is almost twice the price. Full of white peach and light redcurrant flavours, this rosé really does shine bright.
Food pairing: Grilled salmon.
RED
Elephant In The Room Shiraz 2017, £10.99 mix six price, Majestic
A gorgeous, sumptuous red from South Australia’s Langhorne Creek region, it’s unashamedly rich and spicy. The producers have gone fairly large on the oak, a style that may have fallen out of fashion but for some suits Shiraz perfectly. And at 14.5 per cent abv, there’s no way you can ignore this particular elephant in the room.
Food pairing: Steak and chips.
SPARKLING
Mount Bluff Rosé Brut NV, £13.50, Marks & Spencer
Love pink champagne? Give this sparkling rosé from New Zealand a try. It’s created in the same way, as in fermented in the bottle for a second bubble-inducing time. And it’s made from two of the classic Champagne grapes Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, with delicate strawberry fruit flavours. Beautifully made.
Food pairing: Crisps and dips.

Chelsea have touched base with Real Madrid to check on the availability of Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham target Mateo Kovacic.
The Croatia international is ready to quit the Bernabeu this summer in search of regular first team football, but Los Blancos are not smoothing an exit road for him.
Indeed, the offer Chelsea have received suggests that Real Madrid want to scare sides off Kovacic.
According to Sky Italia, Chelsea asked Real Madrid about Kovacic and were told by the Spanish giants that €100m would be needed to win the race for the midfield schemer's signature.
West Ham and Tottenham have also been strongly linked with wanting Kovacic, with even suggestions the Hammers have gone as far as lodging a bid.
But at the €100m price-point, Kovacic is unlikely to be leaving the Bernabeu this summer.
Kovacic made 36 appearances for Real Madrid across all competitions last season.
He was an unused substitute in Real Madrid's Champions League final win over Liverpool.",www.insidefutbol.com,2018-07-04 22:47:10,8,48398
"MADRID: Cristiano Ronaldo has received an offer to leave Real Madrid and join Italian champions Juventus , a source close to the player told Reuters on Wednesday.Ronaldo, who joined Real from Manchester United in 2008 for a then world record 80 million pounds ($105.65 million), is the Spanish club's all-time top scorer with 451 goals in all competitions and has won two La Liga titles and four Champions League trophies with them.Despite the glut of silverware, however, the five-times world player of the year has had frequent fallouts with Real and has declared on several occasions that he wants to leave the club.Moments after lifting a third consecutive Champions League trophy by helping beat Liverpool 3-1 in the final on May 26, Ronaldo appeared to suggest he had already decided to leave Real, telling a television reporter on the pitch at Kiev's NSC Olympic Stadium: ""It was beautiful to play for Real Madrid.""Ronaldo, 33, appeared to backtrack on that statement during Real's celebration parade through the Spanish capital the next day, when he told a mass of supporters: ""See you next season.""The Portugal forward was reported to be on the verge of leaving last June after a news story appeared in Portuguese newspaper Record declaring he was unhappy with the club.He also caused a stir in 2012 when he declared in a post-match interview after a game with Granada: ""I'm sad and the club know why.""Juventus declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, while Real Madrid said: ""Our official comments are made through our official media channels.""Real have not issued any statement on their website about Ronaldo, although in the past days they have issued statements denying reports they have made transfer bids for Paris St Germain forwards Neymar and Kylian Mbappe.Spanish newspaper Marca suggested on Wednesday that Ronaldo is unhappy at Real because they are searching for his successor and president Florentino Perez has publicly courted Neymar, urging the Brazilian last year to come to Madrid if he wants to win the prestigious Ballon d'Or award.Ronaldo scored two goals against Juventus in Real's 4-1 win in the 2017 Champions League final and earlier this season struck a jaw-dropping bicycle kick against the Italians in a 3-0 win in a quarter-final first-leg game in Turin which prompted Juve supporters to give him a standing ovation.The Portuguese converted a stoppage-time penalty in the second leg to knock the Italians out 4-3 on aggregate.Ronaldo enjoyed an explosive start to the 2018 World Cup by scoring a hat-trick in his side's 3-3 draw with Spain, also hitting Portugal's winner in a 1-0 win over Morocco. But he missed a penalty in a 1-1 draw with Iran and failed to score in his side's 2-1 defeat by Uruguay in the last 16.",economictimes.indiatimes.com,2018-07-04 22:47:00,6,635235
