       "Justice Davis told the court Ms Caputo's partial admission that Ms Davoren had \"no right to the money\" had raised \"real questions\" about Ms Davoren's \"criminal responsibility for the misappropriation of the funds\". Ms Davoren spent $61,250 on a Range Rover, and $354,902 of the money remained in her bank account, the court heard. **Repayment of the money will put her account into overdraft.** The couple were in a relationship for at least 14 years, since 2001, but the exact date of their separation is in dispute, the court heard. Ms Davoren was also bookkeeper for at least one of Mr Raymond's companies, and withdrew the money via electronic banking. The court heard Ms Davoren was set to be paid $2,475,000 by Mr Raymond in a separation agreement, but this agreement was \"not enforceable\", and had been changed. Justice Davis ruled she took the $520,186 from Mr Raymond's company as \"a system of self help\" and because it was \"convenient\", when she should have left it to the court or a mediator to decide how to split the couple's assets.                                                                                                                                       1\n",

       "The wider ambition, said Cook, is to become a household name in European investment, just as venture capital firms such as Sequoia are in the US. “Our entire strategy is that Europe is going through the same spurt that Silicon Valley went through in the 1990s, when [VC firms] Sequoia and DFJ raised funds of about $150 million then… scaled up and got to a billion-plus and continued to be household names,” he said. **“The top 20 [US] funds get 50% of the capital.** We believe Europe is going through the same thing, it’s all about those firms that can scale up to be a billion-plus.”\\r\\nThat might mean further regional partnerships down the line, though Cook said there were no immediate plans. Draper already acquired seed investor Seedcamp’s first two funds and backed early-stage UK investor Episode 1. “We’ve always been an acquisitive group,” said Cook. “We bought Seedcamp, now there’s Earlybird, and we entered France by ourselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",

       "US President Donald Trump reportedly wanted to address the crisis by mounting a US invasion and deposing President Nicolas Maduro. Sources say his aides told him that an invasion was a terrible idea, but Trump persisted, and even floated the plan with neighboring countries. **Trump’s bullish rhetoric is likely going to bolster Maduro’s standing at home.** Donald Trump reportedly asked senior administration officials and world leaders if the US could invade Venezuela to bring stability to the country’s political crisis. The US president first asked aides whether the US could just take over the country on August 10, 2017, at an Oval Office meeting to discuss US sanctions on the country, according to the Associated Press. The backdrop was the South American nation’s rapidly deteriorating economy, and the perilous state of law and order there. The previously undisclosed meeting, on which the White House has declined to comment, was anonymously revealed by a senior administration official speaking to AP.                                                                                                                                                                       0\n",

       "Erdogan will be sworn at the parliament, a presidential source, who asked not to be named, told AFP. State media reports said the oath ceremony would be at 1300 GMT. **Two hours later a \"transition ceremony\" marking the shift to the new system will take place at his vast presidential palace on the outskirts of Ankara, Anadolu news agency reported.** The Turkish leader is expected to deliver a speech during the ceremony to be attended by leading figures from the business, art and sports as well as foreign heads of state, according to the Hurriyet daily. The ceremony will be followed by a dinner and then Erdogan is due to announce his new cabinet, it said. Under the new system, Erdogan will enjoy greater powers with the authority to appoint and sack ministers, judges and other state officials. The post of prime minister, currently held by Erdogan's ally Binali Yildirim, is to be scrapped as of Monday, leaving the president in full and sole charge of the government.                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

       "The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) may not withdraw the look out circular against K C Chakrabarty, former deputy governor at Reserve Bank of India, for some time as investigation in a forgery case continues. The CBI had issued the LOC in connection with a 2016 forgery case filed by the Indian Overseas Bank against a Delhi-based travel company — Airworth Travels & Tours Pvt Limited, its promoters and ‘unnamed public servants’. **CBI sources said he has been questioned by the CBI in Indian Overseas Bank case.** The probe is not complete yet and he is not allowed to leave India, the sources said. Sources familiar with the developments said Chakrabarty wants to resolve the issue amicably. The bank has accused them of “…cheating, forgery of valuable securities, forgery for the purpose of cheating, using forged documents as genuine…” and public servants of “abuse of official position”, thereby dishonestly causing a loss.
