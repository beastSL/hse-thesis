**The leaders of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia gather in Thessaloniki, northern Greece, on Wednesday for the fourth Quadrilateral Summit.** The prospects of the Western Balkans joining the European Union and other regional issues are expected to top the agenda, after the EU decided last month to start accession talks with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Albania. Prime ministers Alexis Tsipras of Greece, Boyko Borissov of Bulgaria, and Viorica Dancila of Romania, and Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, will also be discussing closer cooperation in energy, transport, infrastructure and security. The refugee crisis is also expected to be a topic of discussion following last week’s EU summit on the issue. The Thessaloniki meeting is seen as an effort to coordinate the four countries’ positions on a number of key issues ahead of a meeting of the leaders of China and the countries of Eastern Europe and the Balkans in Sofia on Saturday and the Western Balkans Summit of the Berlin Process, which will be held in London next week.	1

And early on, The First Purge teaches us that police aren’t a helpful factor in the lives of our characters: pre-Purge, a junkie slices a young drug-dealer in the face with a razor blade in his mouth.	0
The premise of a “Purge” — the helplessness and anarchy of it — is so promising, it’s no wonder why they keep making these movies and why people (your reviewer among them) keep paying money to see them, expecting guilt-free, bloody mayhem, a symbolic two-hour Purge from the obligations of responsible consumerism. Why then, does this film feel so cardboard? **In part, no doubt, because of its self-seriousness (the moments of humor they do attempt to inject are awkward and misplaced) but also maybe because law-enforcement is never a considerable factor in horror movies, and so removing it, while fun in premise, doesn’t do much as a matter of actual practice.** All horror movies find a way to nullify the comfort of an active and capable police force (“My phone is dead!” or “This cabin is so far away, police won’t be here for hours!”) until the final moments. “No police to help” is the precondition for good horror, but no more.
