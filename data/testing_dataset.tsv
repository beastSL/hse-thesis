**Hundreds of thousands of Americans took to the streets last weekend to demand the Trump administration reunite kids and parents who were separated at the border.** A 6-year-old boy in Atlanta also had an idea: Make money by selling lemonade, and give it to someone who would help the families. By last week, he and his family had raised more than $13,000—some through lemonade and bake sales, but the vast majority from a fundraiser on Facebook, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The money is going to the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, a Texas-based legal services nonprofit helping immigrants, refugees, and children.
